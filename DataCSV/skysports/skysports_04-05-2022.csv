It was half-time at the Estadio de la Ceramica and Villarreal had hauled themselves level on aggregate. Jurgen Klopp' side looked in serious trouble but fortunately for them, that was as bad as it got. By the end, a night which threatened disaster had turned into one of celebration. A third Champions League final in five years beckons and it owes a lot to Luis Diaz. The Colombian, outstanding since his arrival from Porto in January, changed the game after replacing Diogo Jota at the interval, scoring Liverpool's second goal when he headed home Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross and causing near-constant panic in Villarreal's previously untroubled defence. Within 15 minutes of his introduction, he had touched the ball more times than Jota did in the whole of the first half and every one of those touches seemed to strike fear into the yellow-shirted defenders unfortunate enough to find themselves in his vicinity. Juan Foyth, in particular, will be eager to forget his evening up against Diaz, whose explosive pace and sheer relentlessness gave the former Tottenham right-back no end of difficulties. Villarreal 2-3 Liverpool (2-5 agg) - Match report Liverpool fixtures Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Diaz was a whirlwind of activity on Liverpool's left flank, completing four dribbles and attempting four shots - twice as many as any of his team-mates despite only playing one half. But in addition to the chaos factor which destabilised Villarreal so effectively, there was composure in how he used the ball, with all but two of his 20 attempted passes finding a red shirt. Afterwards, Virgil van Dijk lauded his impact as ""incredible"" and the centre-back was not the only one grateful for the 25-year-old's contribution. He was Liverpool's game-changer. Just don't expect him to start on the bench again in Paris.Nick Wright It is a good time to be a Liverpool fan, who can look forward to two more finals this season. Indeed, Jurgen Klopp has guided them into an eighth final during his time as manager and they are just six games away now from an historic quadruple. Liverpool came here to complete the job, show professionalism and to finish what they started a week ago in the face of a crackling atmosphere - but they showed signs of frailty in the opening 45 minutes. Experience would eventually tell, aided and abetted by a distinctly ordinary goalkeeping performance from the hosts' Geronimo Rulli. Liverpool had been in this position twice before under Klopp, progressing on both occasions before losing the 2018 final to Real Madrid and winning a sixth European Cup against Tottenham the following year. Only one team has ever overturned a two-goal deficit from a Champions League semi-final - Klopp's Liverpool against Barcelona that season. Their know-how, particularly in 2019, certainly helped here in spite of Unai Emery's own very proud knockout history in European competition. He was the PSG manager on the receiving end of Barcelona's infamous 'Remontada' in 2017 - and was described as the ""king of the cups"" by Klopp - but this proved a step too far even for him to mastermind his own turnaround for a team currently seventh in La Liga. Ending May with four trophies in the cabinet is becoming an increasing possibility for Liverpool. The Carabao Cup was secured in February, and they can also look forward to an FA Cup final in just under a fortnight's time; underlying all of that is another epic title race which is set to go right down to the wire with Manchester City only one point ahead with four matches. The relentless pursuit of a quadruple - and a seventh European Cup - rolls on.Ben Grounds It is a stat that says it all about Villarreal goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli. The Argentine has made the most errors leading to goals of any player in the Champions League this season with three. Two of those came in the second leg defeat to Liverpool as he weakly let Fabinho's shot through his legs despite it being hit straight at him. A top-class goalkeeper would have definitely stopped the Brazilian's shot and kept Liverpool scoreless at the time. He could do little about Luis Diaz's goal that drew Liverpool level, as his powerful downward header went through his legs. But Rulli was entirely at fault once again for the third and final goal as he madly rushed out to clear the ball, but was beaten by Mane, who then rounded Juan Foyth to tap into an empty net for a simple finish. The 29-year-old was always going to be a major weak link following the first leg. He was incredibly shaky at Anfield as he constantly punched the ball and inspired the Liverpool attack more than his defence. Indeed, he was at fault for Liverpool's opener at Anfield as Jordan Henderson's deflected cross somehow looped over him following some poor footwork as he misjudged the flight of the ball. Over the two legs in this semi-final, Rulli cost his side three goals and things may have been tighter for Liverpool had Villarreal had a better goalkeeper. In fact, Rulli became the first goalkeeper to make two errors in the same knockout Champions League game since Liverpool's Loris Karius. Villarreal boss Unai Emery could certainly learn from how Jurgen Klopp moved on from Karius after that 2018 Champions League final defeat to sign Alisson and fix their goalkeeping issue.Declan Olley Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

While the three-goal cushion may look comfortable, this was a test of Liverpool's nerve and powers of recovery as an awful first half by their standards saw their first-leg advantage wiped out by debut goals in the competition from Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin. But the half-time introduction of £37.5m January signing Luis Diaz, who has reinvigorated 2022 for Klopp's side, changed the game - aided by a poor goalkeeping performance from the hosts' Geronimo Rulli. Both Fabinho and Diaz's goals went through Rulli's legs, while the goalkeeper was beaten to the ball by Sadio Mane when he came charging out to leave the Senegalese forward with an unguarded net to seal the win on the night. ""It feels like the first in 20 (years),"" Klopp, who led Borussia Dortmund to the final of the competition in 2013 and Liverpool in 2018 and 2019, told BT Sport. ""It's outstanding, because we obviously made it a little tricky for ourselves, but we knew these kind of things could happen."" Liverpool head to the final in Paris to face either Real Madrid or Manchester City, who play their second leg in Madrid on Wednesday with City holding a slender 4-3 lead on aggregate. Klopp's side were shocked by Villarreal's aggressive man-marking in the first half which took them out of their own pressing game, and the coach conceded that he struggled to find highlights from the opening 45 minutes to show his players. Villarreal 2-3 Liverpool (2-5 agg) - Match report How the teams lined up Match stats Get Sky Sports ""We knew what was wrong because it was obvious, but we didn't have a situation to show them where we got it right,"" Klopp explained. ""I said (to my staff) 'find one where we do it well and we can show it', and we come in and they said 'no, we don't have it'."" The introduction of Colombian winger Diaz at the break seemed to liven up Liverpool's attack. ""Obviously Luis, what a player he is, but it's not about who came on, it was about how we started to play,"" Klopp explained. The 54-year-old coach said he had no preference for who his team would face in the final on May 28, saying ""whoever it will be, it will be massive"". Mohamed Salah admitted he would rather face Real Madrid than Manchester City in Paris in order to take revenge for Liverpool's 3-1 loss to the Spanish giants in the 2018 final in Kiev. Salah left the field in tears when he was forced off with a shoulder injury in the first half of that game and said he would relish the opportunity to face Madrid again. ""I want to play Madrid, I have to be honest,"" Salah told BT Sport. ""City is a really tough team. We played against them a few times this season. ""But I think, if you ask me personally, I prefer Madrid, because we lost in the final [to them], so I want to play against them and hopefully we will win it."" Salah, who provided the assist for Fabinho's crucial goal early in the second half against Villarreal, felt Liverpool's comeback in Spain underlined their strong mentality. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""It was tough in the first half but then we went to the dressing room. The gaffer talked and we talked to each other as well. ""That shows character and personality in the dressing room. It shows that we are a top team. That's why we can strike back after losing 2-0 in the first half. I think it makes the win more exciting."" Asked if he is motivated by the possibility of winning the Quadruple, he added: ""For sure. Maybe not at the beginning of the season because I always focus on the Premier League and the Champions League but now we are close for everything, so why not?"" Liverpool's hectic schedule continues as they host Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday at 7.45pm knowing they cannot afford to slip up if they are to catch Manchester City.

The consortium led by US businessman Todd Boehly is the preferred bidder to buy Chelsea, but the UK government will not allow the sale to go through unless it is completely certain Roman Abramovich will not receive any of the proceeds. Two months ago Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale and said he would not be asking for his loans to the club to be repaid and all the proceeds would go to a charitable foundation for ""all the victims of the war in Ukraine"". Abramovich was sanctioned by the government on March 10, preventing him from doing any business in the UK. But the sale of Chelsea is being conducted by the Raine Group, an investment bank appointed by Abramovich, and he will have the final say on who buys the club. The government is aware of attempts to restructure any potential deal in a way which could see Abramovich receive the £1.5billion he has loaned the club through its parent company Fordstam Limited. The government has to issue a special licence for Chelsea to be sold and it would not do so if any of the proceeds were going to Abramovich or towards paying back the loans he is owed by the club. Chelsea fixtures Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Chelsea's government licence to operate runs out on May 31 and they are facing the prospect of going out of business unless the club is sold or the licence is extended. The Premier League are meeting on June 8 to constitute the new season, by which time Chelsea would need to have a licence to be part of the next campaign. Chelsea and Abramovich have declined to comment. Analysis by Kaveh Solhekol, Sky Sports News Chief Reporter Last week some of the bidders were told Abramovich or a company linked to him actually wanted to be repaid the loans he'd made to Chelsea. What that would mean is Roman Abramovich was not writing off his loans of £1.5billion and, ultimately, that money could find its way back to Roman Abramovich. There's no way the UK government are going to stand for that, because Abramovich is sanctioned. So what is going to happen to the money? And who's going to have control of that money? Is it going to be the UK government or is it going to be Abramovich? It can't be Abramovich, because he is sanctioned. The UK government are not allowing him to do any business in the UK. So we could have a potential situation where we've got a standoff between Abramovich and the government. And all the while the clock is ticking. The clock is ticking because Chelsea's licence to operate runs out at the end of this month, May 31. There are two sides to this. If you see it from Abramovich's point of view, he is thinking: ""They want me to sell Chelsea for £2.5billion and I'm not going to get any of that money. I'm going to lose all that money. I'm going to lose the club as well and I'm going to lose the £1.5billion I've lent the club"". From the other point of view, the UK government are saying: ""Look at what is happening in Ukraine, look at what Russia is doing in Ukraine. Abramovich is somebody who is linked to the Russian government. He's linked to Vladimir Putin. That is why he's sanctioned. We cannot have him doing any business in the UK. We cannot have him making 1p in the UK"". And in the middle of all this is a stuck Chelsea Football Club. What happens to Chelsea if Abramovich refuses to sell? And of course he could do that. He's got other business interests. He's got a house in Kensington that's worth £150m. He's not selling that at the moment and giving the proceeds away to charity. He's sitting tight. But the only problem is, if he sits tight and refuses to sell Chelsea then Chelsea will go out of business. Chelsea will not exist anymore and, of course, he's always maintained Chelsea are very, very close to his heart and he does not want that to happen. But if that was to happen, who would Chelsea supporters blame? Would they blame Abramovich or would they blame the UK government? So the clock is ticking not just for Abramovich, but also for the UK government because they can't have a situation on their hands when at the end of this month Chelsea's licence to operate expires and potentially one of the biggest clubs in the world could go out of business. Chelsea bidders were told last week they would be allowed to borrow money to finance their offers for the club. A source close to the sale process says the advice on debt was changed at the same time as the bidders were asked to increase their offers by £500m. The bidders are believed to have been told there would be an element of flexibility when it came to debt. The Glazer family bought Manchester United in 2005 in a leveraged buyout which has so far cost the club more than £1billion in interest and repayments. The consortium led by Todd Boehly is the preferred bidder to take over Chelsea and they have until the end of this week to finalise the terms of an agreement to buy the club. The bid is already being scrutinised by the Premier League to see if it passes their owners and directors test. Like the other bids, they have presented their extensive plans for the club to the Raine Group and they have given guarantees they will not sell the club for at least a decade. They have also given assurances they will invest at least £1billion in the club and infrastructure, including redeveloping Stamford Bridge. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The Sir Martin Broughton and Steve Pagliuca bids are still very much in play, with both consortiums still interested in buying the club. They are on standby to re-enter the process if the Boehly bid is unsuccessful. Both believe they have made very compelling bids for the club and both believe the club will thrive and flourish in their hands. It emerged last week that Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Britain's richest man, had tabled a last-minute £4.25billion bid to buy the west London club. But, the consortium of LA Dodgers part-owner Boehly was still named as the preferred bidder. Ratcliffe has not engaged in the process set out by the Raine Group, making it difficult for his bid to be considered. Irrespective of that, his bid remains on the table and Ratcliffe is still interested in buying Chelsea. Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

Runaway leaders Fulham secured promotion to the Premier League at the first time of asking after a 3-0 win over Preston on April 19 and then lifted the title after a crushing 7-0 win over play-off chasing Luton on May 2. They were then joined by Bournemouth on May 3, after Scott Parker's side scored a late goal to sink Nottingham Forest and make their six-point cushion inside the top two unassailable with one game to spare. And with the relegation places having been settled for weeks now, too, that leaves just the remaining four places in the top six up for grabs. But with Huddersfield having secured one and Forest another, there are two berths remaining, with Sheffield United, Luton, Middlesbrough and Millwall left to contest them.

Up until now, there has been an agreement with UEFA that there should be no clash between Champions League matches and Premier League games, with the weekend protected for domestic fixtures. But Sky Sports News has been told there are widespread concerns that UEFA's plans will be unworkable, and may lead to European and domestic games going head to head - especially if proposals are pushed through for 10 Champions League group matches per team from 2024 instead of the six matches currently played. UEFA has already committed to expanding the Champions League from 32 teams to 36 from 2024. That was voted through without fanfare at their executive committee meeting last month. We understand the Premier League is currently lobbying UEFA for only two extra matches per team in the group stages instead of the proposed four. That would take the total number of games in the group stages to eight per team. Under the current system, there are 125 Champions League games in total per season. If the tournament is expanded to include eight group games per team, that would mean 64 more matches - 189 in total (a 50 per cent increase), while 10 group games would lead to 100 more games, and a total of 225 Champions League matches throughout Europe, over the course of the tournament - a 80 per cent increase. Some officials have told Sky Sports News that such a sizeable expansion could well lead to a drop in UEFA revenue, because broadcasters across Europe might be put off from bidding for the rights to host the tournament. UEFA rules dictate that broadcasters who win the rights must show all matches, and not cherry-pick the best. Big Six all to qualify for CL? Why many PL clubs oppose new plans Latest Champions League news Champions League fixtures Get Sky Sports Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The new ""Swiss format"" which UEFA has proposed is expected to be ratified next month by its executive committee - though there are murmurings among European officials that UEFA may be forced to compromise. The plans include 36 clubs all in one ""conference"", whereby each team is drawn to play eight or ten different opponents, based on UEFA's ""coefficient"" - which means those teams who have done better in European competitions historically will be seeded higher, and play more of their group games against lesser opposition. The top 16 teams in the conference will then progress to the knockout stages, where the format will remain the same as now. There will no longer be home and away games against the same opposition until the knockout stages. Elsewhere in Europe, there are concerns that UEFA is pandering to the elite English clubs by offering them more and more places in the Champions League, at the expense of smaller footballing nations. Currently, the champions of 44 European countries have to pre-qualify for the Champions League before they have the chance of reaching the group stages.

How Premier League could have nine teams in European competitions next season,"The race for Europe is on but which teams make it - and how many - is still to be decided. With the Premier League campaign reaching its climax, we look at: There are seven European spots open to English sides - although that number could rise to nine and the amount of teams in each individual competition can shift. As a basis: However, because this season the FA Cup winner will be either Liverpool or Chelsea, and both those teams look set to finish in the top four, their Europa League qualifying spot for winning the FA Cup will be passed down to the next highest Premier League finisher who doesn't qualify for Europe. Similarly, because Liverpool won the Carabao Cup and are set to finish in the top four, their Europa Conference League qualifying spot from that competition will go to the next highest Premier League finisher without European football. So that means sides which finish sixth and seventh in the Premier League table are in contention for a place in either the Europa League or Europa Conference League next season. Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal would qualify for the Champions League by finishing in the Premier League's top four positions. Tottenham would go into the Europa League, along with Manchester United (who would get in thanks to Chelsea or Liverpool passing on their spot from winning the FA Cup). Seventh-placed West Ham would qualify for the Europa Conference League, thanks to Liverpool's Carabao Cup winner's spot being passed on. Manchester City and Liverpool have pulled clear at the top of the Premier League, and while their battle to win the Premier League title continues, they don't have to worry about Champions League qualification. Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp will still be plotting how to win this year's competition, and could meet in the final, but they already have their places in next season's tournament wrapped up through the league. Meanwhile, the last two spots in the top four are still up for grabs with Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham in contention with four games remaining. However, whatever the outcome, it will be a top-six finish at the very least for Chelsea and Arsenal, who return to European competition after missing out last season. Although not mathematically done yet, Spurs have all but guaranteed a Europa League spot with a nine-point gap between them and seventh-placed West Ham, who have just three matches left to play this season. Antonio Conte's side also have a far superior goal difference to the Hammers. The battle for the final Europa League spot continues between Man Utd and West Ham, while Wolves also have their eyes on finishing seventh and potentially securing a place in the Europa Conference League. If Manchester City or Liverpool win the Champions League they will automatically qualify for the competition's group stages next season. That is irrespective of where they finish in the Premier League table. If they qualify for the competition through two methods - ie: they win it and finish in the top four - there is no extra Champions League spot created for another team to fill and the number of Premier League clubs in next season's Champions League will remain at four. The Premier League could have a maximum of five teams in the Champions League next season, though, if West Ham won the Europa League and finished outside the top four. Winning that competition qualifies them for the Champions League group stages. If Leicester win the Europa Conference League they will automatically qualify for next season's Europa League - another additional European spot. That means, if West Ham and Leicester win their competitions and finish outside the Premier League's top seven there will be nine English sides in European competition next season. The nine sides would be: the top four and West Ham in the Champions League, fifth and sixth place, plus Leicester, in the Europa League, and seventh place in the Europa Conference League. But if Leicester were to win the Europa Conference League and finish seventh - the place set to be rewarded with a Europa Conference League spot - there would be no English side in the Europa Conference League next season, as Leicester would be bumped up to the Europa League. That happened in Spain last season with Sevilla and no La Liga side involved in the Europa Conference League. With Liverpool and Manchester City in the Champions League semi-finals, there's a good chance an English side would win the tournament - but that would have no impact on European qualification, with both sides set to finish in the top four. West Ham are into the semis of the Europa League and an additional Champions League spot is up for grabs if they win that competition. Their Europa Conference League spot for finishing seventh would disappear.Leicester - 10 points off seventh with two games in hand - could be playing European football again next year if they progress from their semi-final and win the Europa Conference League to earn an additional spot in the Europa League. Regardless of any permutation, no side finishing eighth in the Premier League will qualify for Europe, unless they've won a domestic or European cup. Eighth-placed Wolves would be the highest-finishing Premier League team to miss out on European football, although they are just three points behind West Ham and five off Manchester United, with a game in hand on both.

Jurgen Klopp's team headed to Spain leading 2-0 and, despite an early scare as Villarreal levelled the tie with two first-half goals, Liverpool fought back to win 3-2 on the night and 5-2 on aggregate to book their place in the Paris final on May 28th against either Man City or Real Madrid. Liverpool have surpassed the Chelsea side of 2006/07, whose own Quadruple challenge lasted all the way until May 1 of that campaign before losing to Liverpool in the Champions League semi-finals. The next leg of the Quadruple will come against Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley on May 14, a repeat of this season's League Cup final, which the Reds won on penalties in February. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, in the race for the Premier League, Liverpool are still just a point behind City as we enter the final four games of the season after an impressive unbeaten run in the league saw the champions' seemingly unsurmountable 14-point lead on January 15 evaporate. In total, Liverpool will face a gruelling seven-match schedule in May now they have made it through to the final of the European Cup at the Stade de France. So, how have other English teams got on when faced with such a daunting challenge, while surely the trophy-laden Liverpool sides of the 80s must have gone close to achieving the feat? And what about some of the great European giants of years gone by? Liverpool fixtures Premier League table As is surely common knowledge by now, no English team has ever won the Quadruple. Prior to this season, the closest any top-flight side had ever got to winning all four major trophies in a single campaign was Chelsea back in 2006/07. Heading into May of that season, Jose Mourinho's back-to-back Premier League champions had already landed the League Cup after beating Arsenal 2-1 at the Millennium Stadium, while they had an FA Cup final date to look forward to with Manchester United, who they were also going toe to toe with in the league. However, the Blues' challenge ended when they lost on penalties to Liverpool at Anfield in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final, while they would also go on to lose their title to United. Manchester United also came close to making history in 2008/09, only to slip up in the semi-finals of the FA Cup when losing 4-2 on penalties to Everton, although they did then get beaten 2-0 by Barcelona in that season's Champions League final in Rome. And, of course, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side have had numerous Quadruple bids as well since the Catalan arrived at the Etihad, the closest being in 2018/19 and last season. However, the former challenge was ended by Tottenham in the Champions League last eight and the latter after a defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals. Liverpool's current quest, though, will last at least until May 11 - Man City could win the league this day if Klopp's side lost to Tottenham and Aston Villa and City beat Newcastle and Wolves - meaning their Quadruple campaign will have lasted longer than any other English team's in history. And before you ask, Manchester United's famous Treble-winning season of 1998/99 actually included a League Cup quarter-final loss at Spurs in the December of that campaign. You would have thought Liverpool have come close before, but actually they have not, despite winning the League Cup four years in a row from 1981. It was the FA Cup that ultimately proved to be Liverpool's Achilles' heel in each of those four campaigns, with the Reds never managing to make it past the fifth round, meaning the closest they came was in 1982/83, only for a shock 2-1 home defeat to second division Brighton to end their Quadruple dreams in February. And it was Brighton again in the cup who scuppered the Reds' chances of winning all four trophies in their Treble-winning campaign the following season. Oddly enough, despite Klopp's 'Mentality Monsters' barely losing a game between 2018 and 2020, they never actually came close to winning the Quadruple. In fact, the nearest they came to achieving the feat was in their title-winning campaign of 2019/20, only for a youth side - selected because of a fixture clash with the Club World Cup - to lose 5-0 at Aston Villa in the League Cup quarter-finals to put an end that dream. In the first season in England when four trophies were up for grabs in 1960/61, it was Burnley who came closest before losing to Hamburg in the last eight of the European Cup in March 1961. However, Celtic did manage to accomplish the seemingly impossible in 1966-67 when Jock Stein's 'Lisbon Lions' won it all - the Scottish First Division, League Cup and Scottish Cup, followed by the first European Cup won by a British team after victory over Inter Milan. Well, the first thing to point out here is that up until the 2019-20 season, France, as in England, was the only other country in Europe's top-five major leagues to have an extra cup competition in the form of the League Cup, or Coupe de la Ligue. So that explains why European giants like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus have all never previously won the Quadruple. Paris Saint-Germain did, though, recently come within a whisker of pulling it off under Thomas Tuchel, only to fall agonisingly at the final hurdle. The big-spending Parisians were awarded that season's Ligue 1 title in April based on a points-per-game ratio after the campaign was prematurely curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when the season did eventually resume, PSG beat St Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final on July 24, before edging out Lyon 6-5 on penalties to claim the Coupe de la Ligue the following weekend. Then, when the Champions League also returned in August, Tuchel's team made it all the way to the final for the first time in the club's history, before unluckily losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. All of which shows just what a mountain Klopp and Co still face in order to make history this season...

Clubs have between two and five games left to seal their fate but 19 out of 20 clubs are still challenging for the title, qualification for the Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League, or to avoid the drop. Data guru Ben Mayhew has calculated each club's range of possible final league positions and found only Norwich have nothing to play for besides pride during the remainder of this season. Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United are all in the hunt to join title-tussling Manchester City and Liverpool in the top four - with Spurs and United potentially slipping as low as eighth to miss out on Europe next season altogether. With seventh spot being the lowest position to potentially offer a European berth, if permutations play out across competitions, it means all teams from fifth to 13th-placed Aston Villa retain the potential to qualify for Europe. Norwich were relegated on Saturday after a 2-0 defeat to Villa and results conspired against them elsewhere, but, theoretically, every single team sitting above the Canaries up to ninth-placed Brighton could finish in the drop zone. Watford have been widely written off in the survival race but the Hornets could still finish in 16th, while the attention for that final relegation spot centres on Everton, Leeds and Burnley - but all three could still secure a top-half finish. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Premier League fixtures Mayhew has also simulated every possible result from the remaining games and calculated the probabilities of each club's possible final positions. The results suggest Manchester City have a 69-per-cent chance of retaining their Premier League crown, while Liverpool have almost the same chance of finishing as runners-up. Chelsea are nailed down for third spot at 93 per cent, with Arsenal pipping Tottenham to the final Champions League berth at 74 per cent - while Manchester United have a whopping 94-per-cent-chance of finishing in their current sixth spot. Each club’s attacking and defensive strength have been rated using an expected goals model, which measures the quality of chances they create and allow.  These ratings were then used to simulate the rest of the season 10,000 times to measure the probability of each club finishing in each league position. Further down the table - between Brighton and Southampton - things become far less predictable, with fairly even spreads between ninth and 15th. The probabilities consign Watford to the Championship but the pressure ramps up for the final drop spot, with Leeds favourites to finish in 18th (46 per cent), followed by Everton (31 per cent) and Burnley (23 per cent).

After facing Chelsea twice in four days, Tottenham now take on another title contender and north London derby rival in Arsenal, with the game being played at the Emirates. Postponed from March 26 due to Covid cases in the Spurs squad, the game could not have come at a more crucial moment in the season. While Tottenham can no longer finish in the top three - although are still on course for their highest ever league finish - should they beat Arsenal, it will see Chelsea win the WSL trophy with a game to spare. Emma Hayes's side are currently four points ahead in first, but Arsenal will be looking to take the most exciting of title races down to the final day. What the managers say Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Arsenal manager Jonas Eidevall: ""I don't look that far ahead [to Sunday], I have massive respect for Tottenham.

It is two very different teams. Both have been performing well in the season. ""For me, that is unrealistic thinking about Sunday now. It is Tottenham. I am so excited to go to the Emirates and play them. First we take that and then we'll think about West Ham."" ""Initially we have scanned it and unfortunately she is going to miss the rest of the season with Arsenal.   ""But it is an injury with ongoing assessment during the week. We will know more after they have looked at it.   ""We have to wait and see, but it is so frustrating for us, most of all for Jordan not being able to participate at the end of the season. We can just hope that it is as good as possible."" Tottenham manager Rehanne Skinner: ""It's going to be a tough test, that's kind of what these games are about and it's important to rise to the challenge. We're looking forward to it, that's something that's on the players' minds that we want to get more points out of it for sure. They're a tough team, but we're going to make it as hard as we can and maybe we can cause an upset. Let's hope that it's the case. ""I think everyone we play is a big rival. I totally understand from a fans' perspective, the north London aspect of it because it translates over from the men's game a little bit more. The longer we're in the league, the more that will become obvious as well. The last game we played in particular, it really was a more true fashioned north London derby. ""I think they were our biggest fans when we were playing Chelsea, but the tables have turned for Wednesday! The biggest thing for us is we want points out of games, we want to show how much we've improved over the course of the season, we want to make sure we stick to the game plan and make it really difficult for them and what will be will be with the title race. We're just concerned with finishing as high as we can and getting as many points as we can out of these last two games.

Gary Neville threw that question to his colleagues in the studio during Monday Night Football as Jamie Carragher and Roy Keane discussed the ""catastrophic fall"" and how long it might take Erik ten Hag to turn the club around. ""It is a question really for the lads, I have been asked it a few times and said that I haven't got a clue what has gone wrong really at Manchester United this season. The first task for me really is to find out what has gone wrong. ""Why has this catastrophic fall occurred? ""Why has this team that finished second last season, 10 to 12 points behind City, found themselves where they are? I still can't put my finger on that. Surely that is something that Ten Hag has to deal with first and foremost?"" Carragher pointed to the noises coming out of the dressing room. ""I think it is really interesting hearing stories about how toxic the dressing room is. Under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, there was something about Manchester United. They were nowhere near as good as Liverpool or City, but they looked like decent lads, a decent group. ""But the things that keep coming out about what is going on inside the club, who is that and where does it come from?

We were not talking about that in the last two seasons. It feels like we have been talking about it a lot this season."" Keane reiterated the importance of character. ""If you have not got a decent dressing room, forget about it, you are in trouble anyway,"" said the former United captain. ""Whatever about the talent and the board room and who the manager is, you have to have a decent dressing room, decent personalities, decent characters. ""We have seen Manchester United through the season, when things have gone against them, that is it, they throw the towel in. That is a bad reflection on the players - the senior players and the younger ones who think they have made it and are players."" Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho were signed last summer with many expecting to see an improvement. Instead, the opposite happened. Was their arrival part of the problem, perhaps? ""That is the only thing you can point to,"" said Neville. ""You can point towards Ole reaching his height and they could not go any further and they got, not sick of the message, but it had become stale and they did not believe he could overtake Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola. ""Or something had disrupted that changing room. They had put the wrong ingredient into the dish and it has made it completely go sour. That is the bit that has to be dealt with because these players are not as bad as the points tally that is on that board. ""They are better than that. There is something deeper that is wrong in that dressing room that is making them play the way they are and get the results they are getting."" The task ahead of Ten Hag is not just to climb the table but ultimately to close what has become a vast gap to the teams chasing the Premier League title. For the third season in four, United are likely to finish more than 25 points behind the champions. Perusing the list of deficits since Sir Alex Ferguson last delivered the title in 2013, Keane stressed that the quality of the opposition is a big problem for United. ""It is ugly, that,"" said Keane. ""Whatever way you look at it, it is not good. We know it is a long way back for Manchester United but of course there is a way back. Maybe the new manager coming is a good time because I always think, you cannot get any worse. ""It is the points tally that worries me because they are so far behind. Even last season Ole finishing second and you're thinking he's doing well, there is such a big gap. The biggest problem for Manchester United is where Manchester City are, where Liverpool are. ""We talk about Manchester United rebuilding as if Liverpool and Manchester City are going to take it easy over the summer. They are going to invest, they are going to get players in, they are going to get stronger. Klopp is staying on, Pep might stay on. ""When he comes in they have to get the recruitment right, he has to get players in and the right players through the door because the last few years just have not been good enough. ""The biggest disappointment for me when they have had these disappointments is the reaction. I don't think they have shown the leadership. Whatever about talent, there are not enough characters in that dressing room."" Could the example of Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool provide the template for Ten Hag in terms of expectations and the timeframe in which the new man might have United challenging again? Carragher believes so. ""I think it is very similar, it really is,"" he explained. ""I think it was possibly a harder job for Jurgen Klopp because the funds are there for the next Manchester United manager. We have seen that over the last 10 years and going forward will be a lot more than what Klopp had when he first came in. ""People talk about how long it should take Ten Hag or any top manager at a top club. There is talk of Liverpool and Manchester City possibly being five years ahead, I have even heard 10 years ahead of Manchester United. I think it is rubbish, I really do. ""I think a top manager gets a top club back on track in a couple of years. That is not to say winning the title or the Champions League but they get them back on track where they are competing. ""Liverpool came in November and they finished eighth in his first season. In some ways it would probably be better for United if they finished eighth and there was no European football. ""But they still reached a Europa League final, beat Manchester United on the way, some top teams, Villarreal, Borussia Dortmund, you thought there was something happening.  ""In that second season, the first full season, he got Champions League. That has to be what Manchester United get next season under Ten Hag. He has to. ""Liverpool were back on track in that third season. All great clubs should be judged on the Premier League and the Champions League. Not necessarily winning it but in with a shout. ""That is where Liverpool come in, they were Champions League runners-up in season three. They go on to win it and then win the Premier League but they are back at the party in year three. That is why I think the talk of five years or more is a nonsense."" Neville rejects the idea that Klopp had it harder than Ten Hag. ""I don't think so. Jurgen Klopp has done the most outrageous job at Liverpool, it has been outstanding. But there were no real set winners at that time when he came in. ""I would liken the job that Ten Hag has coming in and taking on these two outstanding managers who have set foundations at their clubs for five years more like Gerard Houllier's job when he came in and Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger were set. ""You are coming in when there are two or three managers - because I could put Thomas Tuchel in there as well - are set in their jobs and have that foundation. I think the job that Ten Hag has is absolutely huge."" But Neville accepts the timeframe suggested by Carragher. ""I don't disagree with Jamie's timeline of Champions League [qualification] in the first two seasons while he is sorting the recruitment out and getting used to the club. Third season getting very close to the point where the club has confidence and winning a trophy maybe. ""And that fourth year and fifth year is where you want to be winning a title, that is what we are looking at realistically. We would all hope he comes in and blows everyone away and Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola blow up somehow. But they are not blowing up are they?"" Even so, Keane thinks Ten Hag will back himself to have a big impact. ""Any top coach would come in with a bit of an ego and believe they can make a difference - certainly to this group,"" said Keane. ""They can't get any worse next season, surely? They can maybe win a cup or whatever and rebuild the club. ""Any top manager will believe he can get a reaction from the players and he will get backing. It might take a couple of windows but a good manager will believe that he can turn things around pretty quickly. Not in terms of winning trophies, but competing. ""The fans and the club have to get confidence in this new manager. Over the last few years, there have been doubts about Mourinho's style, Van Gaal, David Moyes, Ole. When he comes in, he needs proper support and that power he deserves to get.""

United stopped talk of a potential walk-out demonstration by beating Brentford 3-0 in Rangnick's final home game as interim manager. Old Trafford had a feel-good environment for the game after a wretched season as it closed its doors for the summer with farewells to a host of first-team players who are out of contract. Nemanja Matic, Juan Mata, Phil Jones and Edinson Cavani in all probability made their final Old Trafford appearances, while Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard are also out of contract in the summer. Rangnick told Sky Sports: ""Apart from goalkeeping where we have three excellent goalkeepers in Tom Heaton, Dean Henderson and David de Gea, in all other areas there will be players leaving the club. I wouldn't put focus on special areas of the pitch - it should go through the whole team. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""So far we haven't been able to speak [to Ten Hag]. Erik's focus is on winning the Dutch league, our focus was on our games. ""It's obvious quite a few players will leave and there is a need for top-quality players. I strongly believe that if everyone works together we can bring Man Utd back to where we need to be. ""Other clubs only needed two or three transfer windows to challenge but from now on we need to bring in top-quality players who really help raise the level. If this happens then I don't think it should take too long."" Man Utd 3-0 Brentford - Match report Get Sky Sports Premier League table Premier League fixtures Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  One of the first players Erik ten Hag will need to talk to surrounding the future will be Cristiano Ronaldo, who has now scored nine of United's last 12 goals in the Premier League with a penalty in the 3-0 win. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner won the man-of-the-match award from Sky Sports co-commentator Gary Neville. Ronaldo's future has been cast into doubt due to United's likely failure to qualify for the Champions League, but his current deal runs until the summer of 2023. Rangnick believes if Ronaldo stays next season, he will need support in central striking positions as the player himself isn't fully comfortable at his age playing in the lone striking role. He said: ""Cristiano is not a central striker. He does not want to play in that position, in order to not play central, you have to play two strikers. If you look into international football, there are not many teams who play with two, you either have three or a false nine. It's not a question of a position, the club needs two new strikers who give this team more quality. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Modern strikers do not have to be wingers if you look at Liverpool and Man City, they have top strikers. Gabriel Jesus has hardly played and now he's playing regularly. If you ask me if he's a central striker or a winger, is Grealish a striker, they can switch and rotate. We don't have that many. Mason Greenwood would have been those players, but he's no longer part of the squad. Martial went on loan at Seville, Cavani has been injured."" United were pretty comfortable against Brentford and - with Ronaldo at the forefront - looked fluid and creative in attack. The result looks to have almost guaranteed their qualification for the Europa League next term by finishing sixth or higher - instead of playing in the Europa Conference League. ""In the end I'm not happy with the results [overall], especially in the last four or five weeks,"" Rangnick added. ""Until the West Ham game we were still in the race in three competitions. We had good moments until that West Ham game, we conceded fewer goals but in the last few weeks performances have not been as good as they should have been. In general we have lacked consistency.""

Eight years after moving to David Moyes's Manchester United from Chelsea, the Spanish number eight appeared to wave goodbye in style. In United's 3-0 win over Brentford on Monday night, Mata rolled back the years to his early Premier League days - who knows if we'll see him in England's top flight again? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mata showed pace, precision and skill that defies his veteran years - linking up with Cristiano Ronaldo frequently in a commanding first-half display. The pair - with a combined age of 71 - showed intricate passing in tight spaces which forced Mata to shoot wide of David Raya's goal - before the duo linked up again for Ronaldo's goal that was ruled out by VAR for offside. Ralf Rangnick recognised how much better United played and perhaps Mata was the cause of that. United had 74 per cent possession of the ball in the first half, with a passing accuracy of 91 per cent. ""That is the reason why we were controlling the game,"" said the German. ""It had to do with the players on the pitch such as Juan, Bruno [Fernandes] and Nemanja Matic."" While players such as Matic have confirmed they will be leaving United this summer, Mata is yet to do so. Rangnick couldn't confirm what the Spaniard will do, but hailed the midfielder's skill and professionalism in equal measure. Premier League table Premier League results Watch Premier League highlights Get Sky Sports ""I don't know [what he will do], he hasn't confirmed that but it's possible [that he will leave]. It was an important night for players who have been here quite a long time. If it was their last game to say farewell like this. ""In the last couple of weeks, he showed how professional he is and how much he loves his game. You can feel and see how much he is a professional player. He almost played like a magician.""Sam Blitz This was Brentford's first defeat with Christian Eriksen in the starting line-up but the Dane was blameless for that at Old Trafford. He was their outstanding performer and one of the best players on the pitch throughout, showcasing that trademark distribution. ""He has been so good, Eriksen,"" said Gary Neville on co-commentary for Sky Sports, before wondering about the player's future in the summer. ""There will be clubs a lot higher up than Brentford looking at him. Manchester United need a new midfield…"" Whether that move will come to fruition is unclear but Eriksen will clearly have options. Despite this being a convincing victory for Manchester United - Brentford were well beaten - the playmaker still created more chances than any player on the home team. It is wonderful to see Eriksen performing at something close to his best. Having proven his fitness and at only 30 years old, there are not many squads that he would not improve. It will be intriguing to find out what he decides to do next. For now, just enjoy him.Adam Bate Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In a World Cup year, the credentials of most of England's regular talent are examined in detail, but none more so than the number one position. Based on Sunday's superhuman display, Gareth Southgate needn't look any further than Jordan Pickford in Qatar - his performance may even be good enough to convince the staunchest of doubters. On a day where Everton's survival bid depended on three points, their goalkeeper was a man mountain. In actual fact, Pickford may have registered not one but two submissions for 'save of the season' - denying both Cesar Azpilicueta and Antonio Rudiger with monumental stops in the second half. ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves,"" said Sky Sports' Graeme Souness. It's difficult to disagree. The Toffees approach to the game was aggressive and that worked to unsettle Chelsea, who were a shade below their level best. Regardless, no player epitomised the game plan more than Pickford, who was dogged and antagonistic from the off. The 28-year-old had to be at his acrobatic best to preserve an all-important clean sheet and coped impressively under some relentless pressure, with Lampard reaffirming why he is so highly thought of on Merseyside: ""Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top level goalkeeping."" In the two Premier League meetings between Everton and Chelsea this season, the England international has managed 14 saves, conceding just once. The result may well be the spark Everton require to pull off a remarkable escape with five games remaining. Needless to say, they will have to exhibit a similar amount of stubbornness in every fixture between now and the end of term if that bid is to be successful.Laura Hunter Everton captain Seamus Coleman: ""That save he came back off the line and parried out was world class, and we see that on a daily basis in training, and that is why he is England's number one - some of the saves were world class.""   Everton boss Frank Lampard: ""Jordan made great saves. They are Chelsea and will have chances, but we had chances as well. Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top-level goalkeeping, I am happy with him and all the players, and all the subs who came on.""   Sky Sports' Graeme Souness: ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves. Some of the saves he's not entitled to get anywhere near them.""   Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp: ""The one to deny Azpilicueta is the save of the season. It was magnificent. We've given Pickford a lot of stick in the past, but he was brilliant."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Rob Holding was a surprise inclusion in Arsenal's team to face West Ham, but he certainly made his mark on the occasion. On a day when Mikel Arteta's side were some way below their fluid best, their stand-in centre-back typified the grit that got them over the line. Holding, starting alongside Gabriel Magalhaes in the absence of the injured Ben White, ensured Arsenal did not miss a player who had started more Premier League minutes than any other this season. He took his goal superbly, rising between two West Ham defenders to flick Bukayo Saka's corner past Lukasz Fabianski, but it was at the other end of the pitch that he truly shone. Shortly before his goal, there was a stunning block to deny the unmarked Manuel Lanzini. It was one of three he made over the course of the 90 minutes - two more than any other player. Holding put his body on the line repeatedly and also made nearly twice as many clearances (seven) as any of his team-mates. He was brave but also smart, positioning himself intelligently to cut out passes and ensure West Ham's forwards rarely threatened. Arteta was delighted by his contribution and talked up his importance in the dressing room - even if he does not get as many opportunities as he would like on the pitch. ""To good people, good things happen,"" said the Arsenal manager in his press conference. ""He's a phenomenal person and when you ask him to come, he's always ready."" With four, nerve-shredding games remaining in a gruelling top-four race, Holding's grit is sure to be needed again. Nick Wright Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tottenham's season has reached a defining stage. The long-awaited north London derby comes after a trip to title-chasing Liverpool, a daunting double before season-ending fixtures against Burnley and already-relegated Norwich. Sunday's victory over Leicester ensured Spurs' destiny remains in their hands ahead of the run-in and provided yet more evidence that Antonio Conte's squad harbours the talent required to complete a task that looked so unlikely when the Italian was appointed. Only Mohamed Salah has more Premier League goals to his name this season than Heung-min Son after the South Korean took his tally to 19 for the campaign in style with Spurs' spectacular third against the Foxes. It came after Son's first-half corner had set up Harry Kane for Tottenham's opener, with the striker ending his five-game goal drought with a clinical stooping header. The rekindling of Kane's goalscoring touch was enhanced by the impact surprise omission Dejan Kulusevski had coming off the bench and setting up both of Son's goals. Spurs' front three are firing - at the perfect time. If Spurs are going to pip north London rivals Arsenal to Champions League football, their front three are going to be crucial. Ahead of a pivotal final four games of the season, the manner of the victory over Leicester should have instilled confidence they can get the job done.Jack Wilkinson Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  North London is chasing. That's what will be at the forefront of Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel's mind after conceding defeat to a team blighted by potential relegation concerns. Perhaps Chelsea legs were tired - a legitimate grievance given they played away at Manchester United three days ago - but their performance was reserved, almost standoffish. Chelsea were far too kind to a side whose desperation could have easily played into their own hands. Chances were spurned, despite a heroic display from Everton stopper Jordan Pickford - over half of Chelsea's attempted shots (11) were off target. And yet there was still no sign of Romelu Lukaku from the bench. Third spot is still the Blues to lose, but both Arsenal and Tottenham are closing in. Stamford Bridge will now be cautiously looking over its proverbial shoulder. Three of Chelsea's six Premier League losses this season have come in their last six games - so is form a problem ahead of an FA Cup final against high-flying Liverpool on May 14? Well, it's clear that a prerequisite of the Chelsea job is silverware - something that Tuchel has previously delivered. But this season threatens to crumble if Chelsea manage to slip out of the top-four race and allow favourites Liverpool to clinch the FA Cup. The latter is the likelier of scenarios, but Chelsea must remain alert. They face Wolves, Leeds, Leicester and Watford in the Premier League run-in; crucially, three of those fixtures are at home. The Blues must draw upon their Stamford Bridge dominance to see them through a tricky patch and ensure they supersede their London rivals in the hunt for a top three finish.Laura Hunter Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Leicester have conceded 14 goals from corners in the Premier League this season, the most of any side, and it once again led to their downfall at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The visitors had started promisingly, with Patson Daka striking the foot of a post from inside the Tottenham area. But against the run of play the hosts took the lead when Harry Kane headed in from a corner, completely unmarked, which spurred them on to a 3-1 victory. Rodgers made eight changes to his side, with their focus firmly on the Europa Conference League semi-finals, yet no matter who they have fielded during this campaign, defending corners has been a constant issue. ""Defending corners has been a problem for us all season - we lack aggression and cuteness. It was so disappointing,"" said Rodgers, whose side have surpassed the most conceded in a single season since Brighton's 16 in 2017-18. ""It is something we will have to look at in the summer through personnel. The mentality to head the ball is missing, it's something we would need to address.""David Richardson Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

Everton are 18th in the Premier League table, just two points behind Leeds and Burnley outside of the relegation zone with a game in hand on both. Burnley enjoyed a hard-earned 2-1 comeback victory over Watford on Saturday, meaning the pressure was on for Frank Lampard and the Toffees to get a result. Richarlison's second-half goal at a raucous Goodison Park gave them victory, but speaking on Monday Night Football, Keane said some of the delays in play, prompted by Everton, left a sour taste. Keane said: ""Every time there was an injury, they were staying down for ages. Pickford made some great saves, but his time-wasting was disgraceful. ""But I totally get it. They must win a game of football. I think where Everton are, you're fighting for your lives, fighting for survival, for Frank, the players and for the supporters yesterday."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Everton have only won two out of their last six games - the other coming in a 1-0 victory against Manchester United, also at Goodison Park. Keane suggested the home atmosphere may have a big part to play in Everton's bid for survival. He said: ""The atmosphere, it was electric. Before the game, I thought Everton were in big trouble, but after being at Goodison, I'm thinking that Everton will stay up. Get Sky Sports Premier League table Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week ""I know they have got away games, but they're in form with that atmosphere, the players simplify it and get behind the ball. Their pressing awarded them that goal. ""That spirit, that energy, and I think the defenders would be delighted that they haven't got that responsibility of playing from the back. ""Their total focus is on just defending, when it goes back to the keeper, they can go up the pitch and they can enjoy defending, but not worry about the other side of it."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking to Monday Night Football, Jamie Carragher praised Everton's direct approach in their last two games - particularly in their victory against Chelsea Carragher said: ""What's really jumped at me was how direct Everton were in those two games. Just look at Jordan Pickford's pass map. He's had the ball 44 times and he's gone long every single time. ""Now that is a complete change for Frank Lampard in terms of his philosophy and how he's gone about things at Everton. Now, the interesting thing for me is: will that continue? ""What they did - and I have said it a lot doing this show for seven or eight years, Everton football. I've known that ever since I was a kid. But Goodison Park, going long, getting on second balls and being aggressive. ""Not too worried about playing through the lines, they are going to make it horrible and they are going to make it difficult."" He added: ""It's not pressing mad. A lot of the time it's just that mid-block there... and when they were in the position to press, they pressed! Richarlison did brilliantly and it was a great finish.""

The Addicks announced the decision having finished their League One season on Saturday in 13th place, despite winning six and drawing one of their final 10 games. Jackson took over the reins in his first permanent managerial role in October, stepping up to replace Nigel Adkins who he had served alongside as assistant, with the club 22nd in League One. A run of 20 points from nine games saw him appointed as permanent boss on a contract until the end of the season in December, with the club announcing would be 'automatically extended based on success on the pitch'. Any hopes of a play-off push were dashed by six defeats from seven games in February and March, before the club recovered to end the season 19 points above the drop. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Charlton owner Thomas Sandgaard told the club website: ""This decision has been a very difficult one to make, Johnnie has done so much for the club, but I felt the time was right to make the change as we continue our preparations for next season.

Sky Sports' Charlotte Marsh: ""It was hardly the easiest season for Johnnie Jackson. Replacing Nigel Adkins following his departure in October - first on an interim basis and then permanently after nine wins in his 13 caretaker games - he steered Charlton away from a relegation battle and to a mid-table finish. ""There was also a squad blighted by injuries not long after Jackson took over. At one point, five forward players were unavailable - that would hamstring even the best sides in the world, but the players coming into those positions couldn't quite fill the same shoes. ""Jackson was joined by another club legend in Jason Euell in the dugout and although he won 19 points from his final 10 games, owner Thomas Sangaard clearly did not feel he was the right man to help push Charlton forward and up the leagues. ""Among the fans, many understand the decision, although that does not make it any easier to take. Jackson is a legend of the club that has helped steer the Addicks through some of their best and worst times. ""As a player, he took over Chris Powell's iconic 'tunnel jump' after a home victory and was part of the League One-winning side of the 2011/12 season under Powell. He was also a coach under Lee Bowyer when Charlton beat Sunderland in the final minute of the League One play-off final in 2019, running down the touchline to celebrate with his players. ""He also stuck it out during the dark days of Roland Duchatelet, which bought years of turbulence to Charlton. Not once did he jump ship, even when the club wasn't sure who owned the club at some points in 2020. ""It marks the end of an era at the club and whoever Sangaard appoints next has big shoes to fill, especially in terms of fan endearment. It remains to be seen if this is a good move, and it could be one that will come to define his ownership of the club. He wants Charlton back in the Premier League, and so do the fans. ""However, although the dream of Jackson leading Charlton back into the big time as manager has sadly been brought to an end, 'JJ' will always be a huge part of the club's history.""

On Monday night, the Cottagers thrashed Luton 7-0 at home to clinch the Championship title after they had made automatic promotion safe earlier this month with victory over Preston. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player After spending 13 consecutive seasons in the Premier League between 2001-2014, Fulham's fortunes have been somewhat less stable in recent years, with their last five campaigns ending in either promotion or relegation. No one can question Fulham's bounce-back ability. The pattern is consistent. Relegation woe is followed by the joy of immediate promotion. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  And once again it's only taken the London outfit one season of Championship football to realise their potential as a first-tier club, but questions over their longevity remain. Here we look at how Fulham can ditch their yo-yo past in favour of a sustained run as a genuine Premier League entity. Having won the Championship with a game to spare, Fulham boss Marco Silva will have one eye, or possibly even two, on next season. Fulham seal return to PL Championship table Get NOW TV - save more than 25% Live football on Sky Sports this week In Silva, Fulham have a leader with Premier League knowhow. In both top-flight forays of recent memory, they have been led by managers who lacked such experience. His Premier League win percentage (35.71) may be somewhat underwhelming, but counts for something given his predecessors - Slavisa Jokanovic and Scott Parker - started their respective top-flight campaigns on zero. Fulham have also led the Championship since mid-January and despite suffering a delay to their promotion parade with a few rogue results - notably against Coventry City and Derby County - have known their fate for weeks. Fulham have tried spending heavily with limited success in the past and will need to be shrewd operators in the summer transfer market to ensure they boost their squad in the areas they lack most. This time around, with automatic promotion secure without the need for the play-offs, Fulham are ahead of the competing pack. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  That security may pave the way for player trading earlier in the window and offer any newcomers more time to bed in. Fulham's recruitment policy has been flawed in recent years and relied too heavily at times on loanees. They splurged over £100m on 12 players ahead of 2018/19, before being forced into the January market for a short-term fix in an attempt to save their ill-fated season. A more considered plan of attack, which centres around two or three key targets in specific areas of weakness, as well as some pragmatic fine-tuning to the current squad will provide a better platform for success - this model has been well executed by both Leeds and Brentford over recent seasons. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Aleksandar Mitrovic is undoubtedly Fulham's talisman, although question marks remain over his Premier League suitability. Regardless, Silva appears to know how to get the best out of his record-breaking striker. He is thriving in a settled system guided by Silva's dynamic style. In March, Mitrovic broke Ivan Toney's Championship scoring record by notching his 32nd and 33rd league goals of the season in a win over Peterborough. In Monday night's win over Luton, the 27-year-old broke Guy Whittingham's second-tier record of 42 goals in a single 46-game campaign with his two second-half strikes taking him onto 43 for the season with a game to play. There is a very clear correlation between Mitrovic's bounty and Fulham's fortunes. In 2020/21, the striker scored more international goals for Serbia (7) than he did at club level (4), as Fulham were relegated having only found the net 27 times all season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It's clear that under Silva, Mitrovic has much more potency. He has got better at coming deep and linking play and is much more of a complete forward, registering a further seven assists. It's also no surprise that Fulham possess the league's most abundant provider in Harry Wilson - 19 assists. In order to dictate the outcome of games in the Premier League, Fulham need to figure out a formula that puts their prized asset, who was named Championship Player of the Season, at the centre of the action. Championship winners tend to fare better than play-off winners - although Norwich City remain an exception to that rule. Fulham must therefore harness the momentum gathered from such a successful season and put it to good use in the early part of the new term. Leeds, Wolves and Burnley are all examples of clubs who have won the Championship title in recent years and exhibited staying power in the top-flight by profiting from the promotion wave. This does not last forever - as demonstrated by Sheffield United's second season demise - but could serve to energise a positive start. The same impetus applies to individuals. There will be a void left by teenage sensation Fabio Carvalho - who is set to depart for Liverpool in the summer - but among Fulham's Premier League 2 (Division 2) title-winning youngsters there is a clear abundance of talent to supplement the quality within the first team. The carryover must also extend to Fulham's stellar strike force. If Mitrovic and Wilson can hit the same heights and deliver a comparable amount of firepower in the Premier League, it's entirely reasonable to forecast Fulham's stay in the top tier to extend beyond a single season. Plenty of ifs, buts and maybes, but there are certainly grounds for cautious optimism. Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6. Play for free, entries by 3pm ",positive

Eight years after moving to David Moyes's Manchester United from Chelsea, the Spanish number eight appeared to wave goodbye in style. In United's 3-0 win over Brentford on Monday night, Mata rolled back the years to his early Premier League days - who knows if we'll see him in England's top flight again? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mata showed pace, precision and skill that defies his veteran years - linking up with Cristiano Ronaldo frequently in a commanding first-half display. The pair - with a combined age of 71 - showed intricate passing in tight spaces which forced Mata to shoot wide of David Raya's goal - before the duo linked up again for Ronaldo's goal that was ruled out by VAR for offside. Ralf Rangnick recognised how much better United played and perhaps Mata was the cause of that. United had 74 per cent possession of the ball in the first half, with a passing accuracy of 91 per cent. ""That is the reason why we were controlling the game,"" said the German. ""It had to do with the players on the pitch such as Juan, Bruno [Fernandes] and Nemanja Matic."" While players such as Matic have confirmed they will be leaving United this summer, Mata is yet to do so. Rangnick couldn't confirm what the Spaniard will do, but hailed the midfielder's skill and professionalism in equal measure. Premier League table Premier League results Watch Premier League highlights Get Sky Sports ""I don't know [what he will do], he hasn't confirmed that but it's possible [that he will leave]. It was an important night for players who have been here quite a long time. If it was their last game to say farewell like this. ""In the last couple of weeks, he showed how professional he is and how much he loves his game. You can feel and see how much he is a professional player. He almost played like a magician.""Sam Blitz This was Brentford's first defeat with Christian Eriksen in the starting line-up but the Dane was blameless for that at Old Trafford. He was their outstanding performer and one of the best players on the pitch throughout, showcasing that trademark distribution. ""He has been so good, Eriksen,"" said Gary Neville on co-commentary for Sky Sports, before wondering about the player's future in the summer. ""There will be clubs a lot higher up than Brentford looking at him. Manchester United need a new midfield…"" Whether that move will come to fruition is unclear but Eriksen will clearly have options. Despite this being a convincing victory for Manchester United - Brentford were well beaten - the playmaker still created more chances than any player on the home team. It is wonderful to see Eriksen performing at something close to his best. Having proven his fitness and at only 30 years old, there are not many squads that he would not improve. It will be intriguing to find out what he decides to do next. For now, just enjoy him.Adam Bate Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In a World Cup year, the credentials of most of England's regular talent are examined in detail, but none more so than the number one position. Based on Sunday's superhuman display, Gareth Southgate needn't look any further than Jordan Pickford in Qatar - his performance may even be good enough to convince the staunchest of doubters. On a day where Everton's survival bid depended on three points, their goalkeeper was a man mountain. In actual fact, Pickford may have registered not one but two submissions for 'save of the season' - denying both Cesar Azpilicueta and Antonio Rudiger with monumental stops in the second half. ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves,"" said Sky Sports' Graeme Souness. It's difficult to disagree. The Toffees approach to the game was aggressive and that worked to unsettle Chelsea, who were a shade below their level best. Regardless, no player epitomised the game plan more than Pickford, who was dogged and antagonistic from the off. The 28-year-old had to be at his acrobatic best to preserve an all-important clean sheet and coped impressively under some relentless pressure, with Lampard reaffirming why he is so highly thought of on Merseyside: ""Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top level goalkeeping."" In the two Premier League meetings between Everton and Chelsea this season, the England international has managed 14 saves, conceding just once. The result may well be the spark Everton require to pull off a remarkable escape with five games remaining. Needless to say, they will have to exhibit a similar amount of stubbornness in every fixture between now and the end of term if that bid is to be successful.Laura Hunter Everton captain Seamus Coleman: ""That save he came back off the line and parried out was world class, and we see that on a daily basis in training, and that is why he is England's number one - some of the saves were world class.""   Everton boss Frank Lampard: ""Jordan made great saves. They are Chelsea and will have chances, but we had chances as well. Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top-level goalkeeping, I am happy with him and all the players, and all the subs who came on.""   Sky Sports' Graeme Souness: ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves. Some of the saves he's not entitled to get anywhere near them.""   Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp: ""The one to deny Azpilicueta is the save of the season. It was magnificent. We've given Pickford a lot of stick in the past, but he was brilliant.""

On a day when Mikel Arteta's side were some way below their fluid best, their stand-in centre-back typified the grit that got them over the line. Holding, starting alongside Gabriel Magalhaes in the absence of the injured Ben White, ensured Arsenal did not miss a player who had started more Premier League minutes than any other this season. He took his goal superbly, rising between two West Ham defenders to flick Bukayo Saka's corner past Lukasz Fabianski, but it was at the other end of the pitch that he truly shone. Shortly before his goal, there was a stunning block to deny the unmarked Manuel Lanzini. It was one of three he made over the course of the 90 minutes - two more than any other player. Holding put his body on the line repeatedly and also made nearly twice as many clearances (seven) as any of his team-mates. He was brave but also smart, positioning himself intelligently to cut out passes and ensure West Ham's forwards rarely threatened. Arteta was delighted by his contribution and talked up his importance in the dressing room - even if he does not get as many opportunities as he would like on the pitch. ""To good people, good things happen,"" said the Arsenal manager in his press conference. ""He's a phenomenal person and when you ask him to come, he's always ready."" With four, nerve-shredding games remaining in a gruelling top-four race, Holding's grit is sure to be needed again. Nick Wright Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tottenham's season has reached a defining stage. The long-awaited north London derby comes after a trip to title-chasing Liverpool, a daunting double before season-ending fixtures against Burnley and already-relegated Norwich. Sunday's victory over Leicester ensured Spurs' destiny remains in their hands ahead of the run-in and provided yet more evidence that Antonio Conte's squad harbours the talent required to complete a task that looked so unlikely when the Italian was appointed. Only Mohamed Salah has more Premier League goals to his name this season than Heung-min Son after the South Korean took his tally to 19 for the campaign in style with Spurs' spectacular third against the Foxes. It came after Son's first-half corner had set up Harry Kane for Tottenham's opener, with the striker ending his five-game goal drought with a clinical stooping header. The rekindling of Kane's goalscoring touch was enhanced by the impact surprise omission Dejan Kulusevski had coming off the bench and setting up both of Son's goals. Spurs' front three are firing - at the perfect time. If Spurs are going to pip north London rivals Arsenal to Champions League football, their front three are going to be crucial. Ahead of a pivotal final four games of the season, the manner of the victory over Leicester should have instilled confidence they can get the job done.Jack Wilkinson Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  North London is chasing. That's what will be at the forefront of Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel's mind after conceding defeat to a team blighted by potential relegation concerns. Perhaps Chelsea legs were tired - a legitimate grievance given they played away at Manchester United three days ago - but their performance was reserved, almost standoffish. Chelsea were far too kind to a side whose desperation could have easily played into their own hands. Chances were spurned, despite a heroic display from Everton stopper Jordan Pickford - over half of Chelsea's attempted shots (11) were off target. And yet there was still no sign of Romelu Lukaku from the bench. Third spot is still the Blues to lose, but both Arsenal and Tottenham are closing in. Stamford Bridge will now be cautiously looking over its proverbial shoulder. Three of Chelsea's six Premier League losses this season have come in their last six games - so is form a problem ahead of an FA Cup final against high-flying Liverpool on May 14? Well, it's clear that a prerequisite of the Chelsea job is silverware - something that Tuchel has previously delivered. But this season threatens to crumble if Chelsea manage to slip out of the top-four race and allow favourites Liverpool to clinch the FA Cup. The latter is the likelier of scenarios, but Chelsea must remain alert. They face Wolves, Leeds, Leicester and Watford in the Premier League run-in; crucially, three of those fixtures are at home. The Blues must draw upon their Stamford Bridge dominance to see them through a tricky patch and ensure they supersede their London rivals in the hunt for a top three finish.Laura Hunter Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Leicester have conceded 14 goals from corners in the Premier League this season, the most of any side, and it once again led to their downfall at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The visitors had started promisingly, with Patson Daka striking the foot of a post from inside the Tottenham area. But against the run of play the hosts took the lead when Harry Kane headed in from a corner, completely unmarked, which spurred them on to a 3-1 victory. Rodgers made eight changes to his side, with their focus firmly on the Europa Conference League semi-finals, yet no matter who they have fielded during this campaign, defending corners has been a constant issue. ""Defending corners has been a problem for us all season - we lack aggression and cuteness. It was so disappointing,"" said Rodgers, whose side have surpassed the most conceded in a single season since Brighton's 16 in 2017-18. ""It is something we will have to look at in the summer through personnel. The mentality to head the ball is missing, it's something we would need to address.""David Richardson Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

""What Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola are doing today is, they're basically empowering the squad,"" said Neville. ""You hear managers say 'I've got a great squad', but have you got the guts and the courage to really use that squad in big matches where you need to win? ""Where you know if you don't win there is a large consequence, or you're probably going to lose a league title, or you're going to get knocked out of a European Cup competition. So to do it and then come out of it and win - you've empowered everybody.

""It's really critical that you make everybody feel proud of being part of the squad because there is absolute certainty there is going to come a game that will catch you out, and you're going to need two or three subs to come on and save you.

""It's the first time Jurgen Klopp's left Mo Salah out in what feels like an absolute age, but he must have felt that was a game that he could leave him out in. Why he thought that, we don't know.

""I just thought because he's played Salah in every game, the game that he leaves Salah out in, I thought would be a risk because it tells the rest of the players something. I just thought there was a risk there when I saw the team news come through. I thought that's a test for the other players because they know this guy is going to come straight back in against Villarreal. They know he's number one. So can we get through without him? ""So those Liverpool players come off today getting through without him, and City have got through without De Bruyne, and I think that's the two best players - I think Van Dijk competes with Salah in terms of importance - but those are the two star players.

Find out here... Blackburn got a big win at Preston just when you least expected it to keep themselves in the hunt for the top six. It is needless to say they need to win their last two to have any chance, though. Bournemouth fought back bravely at Swansea in midweek, but they have Nottingham Forest breathing right down their necks now. I think this will be a draw that does not hugely help either side. Prutton predicts: 1-1 (Sky Bet odds) Coventry's play-off hopes are all-but over. But it has still been a fantastic season in the Championship for them, considering the budget they have to work with. Huddersfield have booked their play-off spot and need to keep fighting for that second spot until it's mathematically impossible. They still have that little bit more to play for here, which could see them edge it. Prutton predicts: 0-1 (Sky Bet odds) Championship table Championship fixtures Millwall still have hopes of the top six and just need to keep winning games and hope other results fall kindly for them. Peterborough are down but Grant McCann will be keen for them to keep going to try and build some momentum. I just think Millwall will be too good, though. Prutton predicts: 2-0 (Sky Bet odds) What a rise it has been for Nottingham Forest. You wonder where they would be if Steve Cooper had been in charge from the start of the season, but the fact they have automatic promotion almost in their own hands is pretty incredible. Swansea almost did them a favour against Bournemouth in midweek, and Forest will hope that game took a lot out of them. This is a home win for me. Forest look too good right now. Prutton predicts: 3-1 (Sky Bet odds) Fulham looked a little sloppy in midweek as they missed a chance to clinch the title. It could be won by Monday depending on what happens elsewhere, and they would love to lift the trophy in front of their own fans at Craven Cottage. Luton again will be keeping a keen eye on results over the weekend. They will want to get the job done one way or another and get that top-six spot. I think they have enough for a draw in this one, despite all the injuries. Prutton predicts: 1-1 (Sky Bet odds) Barnsley vs Preston (12.30pm): 0-2 Blackpool vs Derby: 2-0 Bristol City vs Hull: 1-1 Cardiff vs Birmingham: 0-0 Middlesbrough vs Stoke: 2-2 Reading vs West Brom: 1-1 FREE TO PLAY: Do not miss your chance to land the £250,000 jackpot for the fifth time this year!

""I'm pretty sure he's got my phone number!"" the Manchester United interim manager tells Sky Sports, standing within the inner confines of a silent Old Trafford late on Thursday evening. ""He's got another couple of games to play with Ajax, we have another three games to play here. Whenever he wants to speak with me and exchange our opinions, I'm more than happy to do that."" Erik ten Hag was appointed more than a week ago as the man to drive United into a new era, one where they're expected to be back challenging for the Premier League title and major trophies, and one which is still to even make the first tentative steps. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It is scarcely believable that nearly 10 years and four permanent managers have passed since Sir Alex Ferguson announced his retirement - the last time United were English football's top dogs. Right now, they are further away than ever from experiencing the same past glories - set to finish this season with their lowest-ever Premier League points total. But Rangnick, despite admitting the club needs ""open heart surgery"", is upbeat the process to get back to the summit might not take long, providing the right changes are made. ""Knowing Erik will be the manager, with a good recruitment process and bringing in the right players, I'm very positive the supporters and the media will be able to see a better team and, at the end, hopefully a better position in the league,"" he said. Man Utd fixtures Premier League table Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments ""There are quite a few good examples in the league with when Jurgen Klopp came to Liverpool, Pep Guardiola to Manchester City, Thomas Tuchel came to Chelsea - yes, he came in the middle of the season and inherited a top-quality squad, but you still need to win the Champions League. ""If you know what you're looking for, the profiles of the different positions you need, it shouldn't hopefully take too long."" That is where Rangnick will lend his expertise during his two-year consultancy role while managing the Austria national team. The 63-year-old was not prepared to discuss his new job or how both would be combined going forwards - and would neither offer an opinion on whether Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored eight of the team's last 9 league goals, could fit into Ten Hag's demanding style of play. ""This is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag,"" he said, after Ronaldo rescued United again on Thursday night by scoring the equaliser in their 1-1 with Chelsea. ""He's showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it's obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, it's pretty obvious."" Rangnick wants United to find and develop ""future top, star players"" who can be moulded into the club's ways rather than buying a player who is already the finished product, as they have been keen to do in recent years. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The interim boss believes combining that approach with consistent recruitment at each opportunity can, again, move United closer to the country's top teams. ""If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window,"" he said. ""They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. ""I wouldn't be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks. This shows it is possible that this can happen and it would not necessarily need three, four years in order to do that."" Ironically, United face Brentford on Monday Night Football, live on Sky Sports, a club renowned for their work in the transfer market. The Bees have reached the top-flight with their Moneyball-style use of data to drive their player recruitment - making only four signings last summer to help comfortably keep them in the Premier League for a second season. Rangnick rightly points out the difference in size between United and Brentford, which has to be taken into consideration when the two are signing players and their approach to it, but agrees every club needs to follow an 'idea'. ""No matter which club, it is always necessary and important that you need an idea,"" he said. ""You need to know how you want to play, what kind of profiles do we need because if you do not do that, you're always looking for the needle in the haystack. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""This is what I meant when I said 'open heart surgery'. I don't think it's enough to do some minor corrections and amendments. I think it's important to see the big picture and then hopefully bring in the best possible players. ""They should also fit together, this is also an issue, it is not only about bringing some players for defence, midfield and up front, it's also important you get to know the personality of the players and that they really fit and are able to meet the standards of this big club."" In the meantime, as United prepare to play their final home game of the season, Rangnick will keep on waiting to share his ideas with the man responsible for rebuilding United.

The consortium led by US businessman Todd Boehly is the preferred bidder to buy Chelsea, but the UK government will not allow the sale to go through unless it is completely certain Roman Abramovich will not receive any of the proceeds. Two months ago Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale and said he would not be asking for his loans to the club to be repaid and all the proceeds would go to a charitable foundation for ""all the victims of the war in Ukraine"". Abramovich was sanctioned by the government on March 10, preventing him from doing any business in the UK. But the sale of Chelsea is being conducted by the Raine Group, an investment bank appointed by Abramovich, and he will have the final say on who buys the club. The government is aware of attempts to restructure any potential deal in a way which could see Abramovich receive the £1.5billion he has loaned the club through its parent company Fordstam Limited. The government has to issue a special licence for Chelsea to be sold and it would not do so if any of the proceeds were going to Abramovich or towards paying back the loans he is owed by the club. Chelsea fixtures Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Chelsea's government licence to operate runs out on May 31 and they are facing the prospect of going out of business unless the club is sold or the licence is extended. The Premier League are meeting on June 8 to constitute the new season, by which time Chelsea would need to have a licence to be part of the next campaign. Chelsea and Abramovich have declined to comment. Analysis by Kaveh Solhekol, Sky Sports News Chief Reporter Last week some of the bidders were told Abramovich or a company linked to him actually wanted to be repaid the loans he'd made to Chelsea. What that would mean is Roman Abramovich was not writing off his loans of £1.5billion and, ultimately, that money could find its way back to Roman Abramovich. There's no way the UK government are going to stand for that, because Abramovich is sanctioned. So what is going to happen to the money? And who's going to have control of that money? Is it going to be the UK government or is it going to be Abramovich? It can't be Abramovich, because he is sanctioned. The UK government are not allowing him to do any business in the UK. So we could have a potential situation where we've got a standoff between Abramovich and the government. And all the while the clock is ticking. The clock is ticking because Chelsea's licence to operate runs out at the end of this month, May 31. There are two sides to this. If you see it from Abramovich's point of view, he is thinking: ""They want me to sell Chelsea for £2.5billion and I'm not going to get any of that money. I'm going to lose all that money. I'm going to lose the club as well and I'm going to lose the £1.5billion I've lent the club"". From the other point of view, the UK government are saying: ""Look at what is happening in Ukraine, look at what Russia is doing in Ukraine. Abramovich is somebody who is linked to the Russian government. He's linked to Vladimir Putin. That is why he's sanctioned. We cannot have him doing any business in the UK. We cannot have him making 1p in the UK"". And in the middle of all this is a stuck Chelsea Football Club. What happens to Chelsea if Abramovich refuses to sell? And of course he could do that. He's got other business interests. He's got a house in Kensington that's worth £150m. He's not selling that at the moment and giving the proceeds away to charity. He's sitting tight. But the only problem is, if he sits tight and refuses to sell Chelsea then Chelsea will go out of business. Chelsea will not exist anymore and, of course, he's always maintained Chelsea are very, very close to his heart and he does not want that to happen. But if that was to happen, who would Chelsea supporters blame? Would they blame Abramovich or would they blame the UK government? So the clock is ticking not just for Abramovich, but also for the UK government because they can't have a situation on their hands when at the end of this month Chelsea's licence to operate expires and potentially one of the biggest clubs in the world could go out of business. Chelsea bidders were told last week they would be allowed to borrow money to finance their offers for the club. A source close to the sale process says the advice on debt was changed at the same time as the bidders were asked to increase their offers by £500m. The bidders are believed to have been told there would be an element of flexibility when it came to debt. The Glazer family bought Manchester United in 2005 in a leveraged buyout which has so far cost the club more than £1billion in interest and repayments. The consortium led by Todd Boehly is the preferred bidder to take over Chelsea and they have until the end of this week to finalise the terms of an agreement to buy the club. The bid is already being scrutinised by the Premier League to see if it passes their owners and directors test. Like the other bids, they have presented their extensive plans for the club to the Raine Group and they have given guarantees they will not sell the club for at least a decade. They have also given assurances they will invest at least £1billion in the club and infrastructure, including redeveloping Stamford Bridge. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The Sir Martin Broughton and Steve Pagliuca bids are still very much in play, with both consortiums still interested in buying the club. They are on standby to re-enter the process if the Boehly bid is unsuccessful. Both believe they have made very compelling bids for the club and both believe the club will thrive and flourish in their hands. It emerged last week that Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Britain's richest man, had tabled a last-minute £4.25billion bid to buy the west London club. But, the consortium of LA Dodgers part-owner Boehly was still named as the preferred bidder. Ratcliffe has not engaged in the process set out by the Raine Group, making it difficult for his bid to be considered. Irrespective of that, his bid remains on the table and Ratcliffe is still interested in buying Chelsea. Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

While the three-goal cushion may look comfortable, this was a test of Liverpool's nerve and powers of recovery as an awful first half by their standards saw their first-leg advantage wiped out by debut goals in the competition from Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin. But the half-time introduction of £37.5m January signing Luis Diaz, who has reinvigorated 2022 for Klopp's side, changed the game - aided by a poor goalkeeping performance from the hosts' Geronimo Rulli. Both Fabinho and Diaz's goals went through Rulli's legs, while the goalkeeper was beaten to the ball by Sadio Mane when he came charging out to leave the Senegalese forward with an unguarded net to seal the win on the night. ""It feels like the first in 20 (years),"" Klopp, who led Borussia Dortmund to the final of the competition in 2013 and Liverpool in 2018 and 2019, told BT Sport. ""It's outstanding, because we obviously made it a little tricky for ourselves, but we knew these kind of things could happen."" Liverpool head to the final in Paris to face either Real Madrid or Manchester City, who play their second leg in Madrid on Wednesday with City holding a slender 4-3 lead on aggregate. Klopp's side were shocked by Villarreal's aggressive man-marking in the first half which took them out of their own pressing game, and the coach conceded that he struggled to find highlights from the opening 45 minutes to show his players. Villarreal 2-3 Liverpool (2-5 agg) - Match report How the teams lined up Match stats Get Sky Sports ""We knew what was wrong because it was obvious, but we didn't have a situation to show them where we got it right,"" Klopp explained. ""I said (to my staff) 'find one where we do it well and we can show it', and we come in and they said 'no, we don't have it'."" The introduction of Colombian winger Diaz at the break seemed to liven up Liverpool's attack. ""Obviously Luis, what a player he is, but it's not about who came on, it was about how we started to play,"" Klopp explained. The 54-year-old coach said he had no preference for who his team would face in the final on May 28, saying ""whoever it will be, it will be massive"". Mohamed Salah admitted he would rather face Real Madrid than Manchester City in Paris in order to take revenge for Liverpool's 3-1 loss to the Spanish giants in the 2018 final in Kiev. Salah left the field in tears when he was forced off with a shoulder injury in the first half of that game and said he would relish the opportunity to face Madrid again. ""I want to play Madrid, I have to be honest,"" Salah told BT Sport. ""City is a really tough team. We played against them a few times this season. ""But I think, if you ask me personally, I prefer Madrid, because we lost in the final [to them], so I want to play against them and hopefully we will win it."" Salah, who provided the assist for Fabinho's crucial goal early in the second half against Villarreal, felt Liverpool's comeback in Spain underlined their strong mentality. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""It was tough in the first half but then we went to the dressing room. The gaffer talked and we talked to each other as well. ""That shows character and personality in the dressing room. It shows that we are a top team. That's why we can strike back after losing 2-0 in the first half. I think it makes the win more exciting."" Asked if he is motivated by the possibility of winning the Quadruple, he added: ""For sure. Maybe not at the beginning of the season because I always focus on the Premier League and the Champions League but now we are close for everything, so why not?"" Liverpool's hectic schedule continues as they host Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday at 7.45pm knowing they cannot afford to slip up if they are to catch Manchester City.

It was half-time at the Estadio de la Ceramica and Villarreal had hauled themselves level on aggregate. Jurgen Klopp' side looked in serious trouble but fortunately for them, that was as bad as it got. By the end, a night which threatened disaster had turned into one of celebration. A third Champions League final in five years beckons and it owes a lot to Luis Diaz. The Colombian, outstanding since his arrival from Porto in January, changed the game after replacing Diogo Jota at the interval, scoring Liverpool's second goal when he headed home Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross and causing near-constant panic in Villarreal's previously untroubled defence. Within 15 minutes of his introduction, he had touched the ball more times than Jota did in the whole of the first half and every one of those touches seemed to strike fear into the yellow-shirted defenders unfortunate enough to find themselves in his vicinity. Juan Foyth, in particular, will be eager to forget his evening up against Diaz, whose explosive pace and sheer relentlessness gave the former Tottenham right-back no end of difficulties. Villarreal 2-3 Liverpool (2-5 agg) - Match report Liverpool fixtures Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Diaz was a whirlwind of activity on Liverpool's left flank, completing four dribbles and attempting four shots - twice as many as any of his team-mates despite only playing one half. But in addition to the chaos factor which destabilised Villarreal so effectively, there was composure in how he used the ball, with all but two of his 20 attempted passes finding a red shirt. Afterwards, Virgil van Dijk lauded his impact as ""incredible"" and the centre-back was not the only one grateful for the 25-year-old's contribution. He was Liverpool's game-changer. Just don't expect him to start on the bench again in Paris.Nick Wright It is a good time to be a Liverpool fan, who can look forward to two more finals this season. Indeed, Jurgen Klopp has guided them into an eighth final during his time as manager and they are just six games away now from an historic quadruple. Liverpool came here to complete the job, show professionalism and to finish what they started a week ago in the face of a crackling atmosphere - but they showed signs of frailty in the opening 45 minutes. Experience would eventually tell, aided and abetted by a distinctly ordinary goalkeeping performance from the hosts' Geronimo Rulli. Liverpool had been in this position twice before under Klopp, progressing on both occasions before losing the 2018 final to Real Madrid and winning a sixth European Cup against Tottenham the following year. Only one team has ever overturned a two-goal deficit from a Champions League semi-final - Klopp's Liverpool against Barcelona that season. Their know-how, particularly in 2019, certainly helped here in spite of Unai Emery's own very proud knockout history in European competition. He was the PSG manager on the receiving end of Barcelona's infamous 'Remontada' in 2017 - and was described as the ""king of the cups"" by Klopp - but this proved a step too far even for him to mastermind his own turnaround for a team currently seventh in La Liga. Ending May with four trophies in the cabinet is becoming an increasing possibility for Liverpool. The Carabao Cup was secured in February, and they can also look forward to an FA Cup final in just under a fortnight's time; underlying all of that is another epic title race which is set to go right down to the wire with Manchester City only one point ahead with four matches. The relentless pursuit of a quadruple - and a seventh European Cup - rolls on.Ben Grounds It is a stat that says it all about Villarreal goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli. The Argentine has made the most errors leading to goals of any player in the Champions League this season with three. Two of those came in the second leg defeat to Liverpool as he weakly let Fabinho's shot through his legs despite it being hit straight at him. A top-class goalkeeper would have definitely stopped the Brazilian's shot and kept Liverpool scoreless at the time. He could do little about Luis Diaz's goal that drew Liverpool level, as his powerful downward header went through his legs. But Rulli was entirely at fault once again for the third and final goal as he madly rushed out to clear the ball, but was beaten by Mane, who then rounded Juan Foyth to tap into an empty net for a simple finish. The 29-year-old was always going to be a major weak link following the first leg. He was incredibly shaky at Anfield as he constantly punched the ball and inspired the Liverpool attack more than his defence. Indeed, he was at fault for Liverpool's opener at Anfield as Jordan Henderson's deflected cross somehow looped over him following some poor footwork as he misjudged the flight of the ball. Over the two legs in this semi-final, Rulli cost his side three goals and things may have been tighter for Liverpool had Villarreal had a better goalkeeper. In fact, Rulli became the first goalkeeper to make two errors in the same knockout Champions League game since Liverpool's Loris Karius. Villarreal boss Unai Emery could certainly learn from how Jurgen Klopp moved on from Karius after that 2018 Champions League final defeat to sign Alisson and fix their goalkeeping issue.Declan Olley Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

One week on from City's astounding 4-3 first-leg triumph at the Etihad Stadium, the champions of England and Spain lock horns in Madrid with their Champions League semi-final on a knife edge. Sky Sports pundit Neville believes Pep Guardiola's side must produce the ""performance of their lives"" to reach successive European finals at the expense of the 13-time winners, and keep their hopes of a Premier League and Champions League double alive. ""This is a monstrous game in midweek for City,"" Neville said. ""Manchester City versus Real Madrid is an event. The game last week was, but this on Wednesday is like a heavyweight boxing clash of the century. ""You have one every few years whereby you've got this historic club that has basically got this inbuilt resilience in this competition that punches well above its actual ability. ""Real Madrid were on the canvas a couple of times [against PSG, Chelsea, and at Man City] but they got up, and that is the thing Pep will fear most. ""However well City play, however good their football is, how much possession they keep, there will be a dangerous beast facing them that doesn't know how to give in, how to stop, or call it a day. That is what is coming on Wednesday. Nev: City, Liverpool never feel pressure Man City and Liverpool run-ins compared Download the Sky Sports app Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""Whereas Liverpool need a goal [against Villarreal], Manchester City need the performance of their lives in the Bernabeu. ""This game will have huge impact on Manchester City for the rest of the season, because if they do go out on Wednesday after losing last season's final to Chelsea disappointingly, there will be a drain on Pep Guardiola and what he and the players want to achieve. It's a big week."" Madrid's staying power has seen them dump Paris Saint-Germain and holders Chelsea out en route to the last four and that never-say-die attitude weathered a relentless barrage from Manchester City in last week's semi-final first leg to keep their hopes of reaching another final alive. It is that spirit which Neville cites as the reason for his reluctance to rule out Real Madrid's chances of progressing, despite believing Manchester City's superior quality will help them navigate this latest, greatest hurdle to reach the Champions League final. ""I think City will go through, but you cannot write off Real Madrid because of the historic resilience they prove time and time again,"" Neville added. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Real Madrid were done in the first half at the Etihad, weren't they? We thought City were going to do them 3, 4, 5, 6 without reply. But there's something in the Real Madrid team. ""Real Madrid have a spirit in the Champions League that City don't. It's a big moment for City - a very big moment. Manchester City haven't got that Champions league spirit yet, that history. They've struggled to come to terms with the competition, the fans have in terms of the early days getting used to it. Real are without key defender David Alaba through injury but the Casemiro is fit to feature in midfield.   Casemiro’s availability, having only been fit enough for the bench last week, gives Carlo Ancelotti a selection poser over whether or not to retain the in-form Rodrygo, who has scored four goals in his last five games.   Man City could have Kyle Walker back in action. The defender, who has been absent for the last five matches while recovering from an ankle issue, has trained and was due to travel with the squad to Spain, with a late decision to be made.   John Stones remains sidelined after coming off in the first half of the 4-3 first-leg victory last week, while Joao Cancelo, suspended for that match, is available. ""Losing to Chelsea last year has given them the motivation - like hang on, we need this now! They'll need everything and more. They needed it against Atletico to get through that. They'll need everything and even more to get past Real Madrid because they are going to have to go to the end. ""City are favourites because they will score goals at the Bernabeu. Chelsea scored goals over there, they were outstanding, and City play very well. They pass the ball well and when you do that in an away stadium with the home team getting drawn forward by the crowd, City will get chances and flood them open."" De Bruyne played an instrumental role as Manchester City established their slender first-leg advantage with his side's second-minute opener and an assist in last week's absorbing 4-3 victory. Neville insists De Bruyne's world-class talent is irrefutable but believes Wednesday's clash at the Bernabeu presents the Belgian with the opportunity to cement his legacy by guiding City to an elusive Champions League crown. ""Kevin De Bruyne is the man you know can be the difference,"" Neville added. ""He was brilliant, sensational in the first leg against Real Madrid and he's going to have to be that again. This is his moment. ""De Bruyne has always been respected, loved by everyone in the Premier League, he's a joy to watch, but to get to that next level of winning your team the Champions League, go and score the winner in the Bernabeu, put the performance in which brings him the success to go with his world-class talent.

Having revolutionised the game at Barcelona, the different challenge undertaken by Guardiola in Manchester has produced similar results with the exception of that elusive Champions League crown, which Neville believes stands between the Spaniard and City greatness. ""Pep had the greatest football team of all time at Barcelona,"" he added. ""I've never seen a football team like that over a three- to four-year period. But he's doing it differently at Manchester City, he is doing it differently. ""He hasn't got Messi, this phenomenon that existed in that team, and he probably wants to do it again. He needs to win that Champions League and if Pep Guardiola could win the Champions League and the Premier League this season, it would be sensational.

Jurgen Klopp's team headed to Spain leading 2-0 and, despite an early scare as Villarreal levelled the tie with two first-half goals, Liverpool fought back to win 3-2 on the night and 5-2 on aggregate to book their place in the Paris final on May 28th against either Man City or Real Madrid. Liverpool have surpassed the Chelsea side of 2006/07, whose own Quadruple challenge lasted all the way until May 1 of that campaign before losing to Liverpool in the Champions League semi-finals. The next leg of the Quadruple will come against Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley on May 14, a repeat of this season's League Cup final, which the Reds won on penalties in February. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, in the race for the Premier League, Liverpool are still just a point behind City as we enter the final four games of the season after an impressive unbeaten run in the league saw the champions' seemingly unsurmountable 14-point lead on January 15 evaporate. In total, Liverpool will face a gruelling seven-match schedule in May now they have made it through to the final of the European Cup at the Stade de France. So, how have other English teams got on when faced with such a daunting challenge, while surely the trophy-laden Liverpool sides of the 80s must have gone close to achieving the feat? And what about some of the great European giants of years gone by? Liverpool fixtures Premier League table As is surely common knowledge by now, no English team has ever won the Quadruple. Prior to this season, the closest any top-flight side had ever got to winning all four major trophies in a single campaign was Chelsea back in 2006/07. Heading into May of that season, Jose Mourinho's back-to-back Premier League champions had already landed the League Cup after beating Arsenal 2-1 at the Millennium Stadium, while they had an FA Cup final date to look forward to with Manchester United, who they were also going toe to toe with in the league. However, the Blues' challenge ended when they lost on penalties to Liverpool at Anfield in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final, while they would also go on to lose their title to United. Manchester United also came close to making history in 2008/09, only to slip up in the semi-finals of the FA Cup when losing 4-2 on penalties to Everton, although they did then get beaten 2-0 by Barcelona in that season's Champions League final in Rome. And, of course, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side have had numerous Quadruple bids as well since the Catalan arrived at the Etihad, the closest being in 2018/19 and last season. However, the former challenge was ended by Tottenham in the Champions League last eight and the latter after a defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals. Liverpool's current quest, though, will last at least until May 11 - Man City could win the league this day if Klopp's side lost to Tottenham and Aston Villa and City beat Newcastle and Wolves - meaning their Quadruple campaign will have lasted longer than any other English team's in history. And before you ask, Manchester United's famous Treble-winning season of 1998/99 actually included a League Cup quarter-final loss at Spurs in the December of that campaign. You would have thought Liverpool have come close before, but actually they have not, despite winning the League Cup four years in a row from 1981. It was the FA Cup that ultimately proved to be Liverpool's Achilles' heel in each of those four campaigns, with the Reds never managing to make it past the fifth round, meaning the closest they came was in 1982/83, only for a shock 2-1 home defeat to second division Brighton to end their Quadruple dreams in February. And it was Brighton again in the cup who scuppered the Reds' chances of winning all four trophies in their Treble-winning campaign the following season. Oddly enough, despite Klopp's 'Mentality Monsters' barely losing a game between 2018 and 2020, they never actually came close to winning the Quadruple. In fact, the nearest they came to achieving the feat was in their title-winning campaign of 2019/20, only for a youth side - selected because of a fixture clash with the Club World Cup - to lose 5-0 at Aston Villa in the League Cup quarter-finals to put an end that dream. In the first season in England when four trophies were up for grabs in 1960/61, it was Burnley who came closest before losing to Hamburg in the last eight of the European Cup in March 1961. However, Celtic did manage to accomplish the seemingly impossible in 1966-67 when Jock Stein's 'Lisbon Lions' won it all - the Scottish First Division, League Cup and Scottish Cup, followed by the first European Cup won by a British team after victory over Inter Milan. Well, the first thing to point out here is that up until the 2019-20 season, France, as in England, was the only other country in Europe's top-five major leagues to have an extra cup competition in the form of the League Cup, or Coupe de la Ligue. So that explains why European giants like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus have all never previously won the Quadruple. Paris Saint-Germain did, though, recently come within a whisker of pulling it off under Thomas Tuchel, only to fall agonisingly at the final hurdle. The big-spending Parisians were awarded that season's Ligue 1 title in April based on a points-per-game ratio after the campaign was prematurely curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when the season did eventually resume, PSG beat St Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final on July 24, before edging out Lyon 6-5 on penalties to claim the Coupe de la Ligue the following weekend. Then, when the Champions League also returned in August, Tuchel's team made it all the way to the final for the first time in the club's history, before unluckily losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. All of which shows just what a mountain Klopp and Co still face in order to make history this season...

Up until now, there has been an agreement with UEFA that there should be no clash between Champions League matches and Premier League games, with the weekend protected for domestic fixtures. But Sky Sports News has been told there are widespread concerns that UEFA's plans will be unworkable, and may lead to European and domestic games going head to head - especially if proposals are pushed through for 10 Champions League group matches per team from 2024 instead of the six matches currently played. UEFA has already committed to expanding the Champions League from 32 teams to 36 from 2024. That was voted through without fanfare at their executive committee meeting last month. We understand the Premier League is currently lobbying UEFA for only two extra matches per team in the group stages instead of the proposed four. That would take the total number of games in the group stages to eight per team. Under the current system, there are 125 Champions League games in total per season. If the tournament is expanded to include eight group games per team, that would mean 64 more matches - 189 in total (a 50 per cent increase), while 10 group games would lead to 100 more games, and a total of 225 Champions League matches throughout Europe, over the course of the tournament - a 80 per cent increase. Some officials have told Sky Sports News that such a sizeable expansion could well lead to a drop in UEFA revenue, because broadcasters across Europe might be put off from bidding for the rights to host the tournament. UEFA rules dictate that broadcasters who win the rights must show all matches, and not cherry-pick the best. Big Six all to qualify for CL? Why many PL clubs oppose new plans Latest Champions League news Champions League fixtures Get Sky Sports Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The new ""Swiss format"" which UEFA has proposed is expected to be ratified next month by its executive committee - though there are murmurings among European officials that UEFA may be forced to compromise. The plans include 36 clubs all in one ""conference"", whereby each team is drawn to play eight or ten different opponents, based on UEFA's ""coefficient"" - which means those teams who have done better in European competitions historically will be seeded higher, and play more of their group games against lesser opposition. The top 16 teams in the conference will then progress to the knockout stages, where the format will remain the same as now. There will no longer be home and away games against the same opposition until the knockout stages. Elsewhere in Europe, there are concerns that UEFA is pandering to the elite English clubs by offering them more and more places in the Champions League, at the expense of smaller footballing nations. Currently, the champions of 44 European countries have to pre-qualify for the Champions League before they have the chance of reaching the group stages.

Probabilities revealed as odds drop from 3,000/1 to 7/1","Jurgen Klopp thinks Liverpool's chances of winning the quadruple are ""really unlikely"" - but is he right? We run the numbers to gauge the true probability. Having already won the Carabao Cup, Klopp's side are just a point behind leaders Man City as we enter the final seven games of the season after an impressive unbeaten run in the league saw the champions' seemingly unsurmountable 14-point lead on January 15 evaporate. Liverpool play Manchester United next on Tuesday, a game live on Sky Sports from 7pm. Meanwhile, Liverpool also play Villarreal in the Champions League semi-finals, the first leg of which is at Anfield on April 27, before the return leg at El Madrigal on May 3. In total, Liverpool face a gruelling nine-match schedule in April, followed by another seven games in May, including the FA Cup final, if they also make it through to the final of the Champions League. At the start of the season the chances of Liverpool doing the unthinkable and winning the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup stood at 0.02 per cent. To put that into context, statistically, there is more chance of Gary Neville becoming the next leader of the Conservative Party or Romelu Lukaku winning this year's Ballon D'Or than it was for Liverpool to win the quadruple at the start of the season. Liverpool fixtures Latest Liverpool news Premier League table Get NOW to stream big moments It's a probability that equated to 3,000/1 when converting to fractional odds with Sky Bet. Well, fast forward to now and after Saturday's FA Cup semi-final win, Liverpool stand a 12.5 per cent chance of ending the season with all four trophies in their cabinet, equating to 7/1 odds. Klopp's ""really unlikely"" description of the challenge ahead understandably is downplaying something which is actually very achievable. Liverpool fans have a right to be excited, in particular two Sky Bet punters who backed Klopp's men to win four trophies back in August at colossal odds. ""Two customers who each staked £30 at 2,000/1 will no doubt be kicking every ball over the coming month,"" reveals Sky Bet's Head of Sports PR, Michael Shinners. ""With one leg of the quadruple already under their belts and a second final confirmed, Liverpool ante post backers will be getting very excited. The current odds on the last three trophies bring won is now only 7/1."" Of all three remaining competitions, Liverpool's chances of winning the Premier League is the most unlikely. This is where the quadruple bid is most likely to crash. The 2-2 draw between the Reds and Manchester City has left the Premier League title race in the balance - but Pep Guardiola's men are still favourites. After hitting a high of 12/1 in mid-January, Liverpool are now just 7/4 with Sky Bet to claim a second title in three seasons which equates to around a 35 per cent chance. When analysing their remaining fixtures, Liverpool will go off as favourites to win in every game, to the extent they will stand a 50 per cent or higher chance of picking up three points, barring no injury crisis or severe squad rotation. Their toughest fixtures on paper are the away trips to Aston Villa and in-form Newcastle but even then, Klopp's men would be odds-on to come through those games with three points. For Liverpool to win all their remaining seven Premier League games and finish on 94 points is around a 14 per cent probability, according to Sky Bet's odds. It would therefore result in a scenario where Klopp's men would have taken 52 points from the last 54 available in the season with the draw at Manchester City their only dropped points in their last 18 league fixtures. If they win every game, no other side in Premier League history would have collected more points from their final 18 games. As it stands, of the sides Man City have left to play, only West Ham and Wolves are currently in the top eight. There is also the Steven Gerrard factor to consider. Although the former Liverpool captain never managed to win the Premier League himself, he can have a significant say in this title race. The Reds have that meeting at Villa Park with their old captain, now Aston Villa's manager, on 10 May, while City end the season at home against them on May 22. A titanic tussle awaits. With just one game separating them from the trophy, Liverpool's chances of winning the FA Cup are the most likely of all three of the trophies on the table, although Klopp has never won this domestic cup. The Reds will be aiming to win their first FA Cup since 2006 when they face Chelsea in the final on 14 May. Klopp's side had a blistering first-half display to thank against Manchester City in the semi-final which set the platform for a 3-2 at Wembley while Chelsea beat Crystal Palace on Sunday to join them for what will be a repeat of the Carabao Cup final. That was a very tight affair that took penalties to separate the teams. Yet, Liverpool head into this final favourites to lift the trophy in their pursuit of history. Liverpool stand more chance of winning the Champions League than the Premier League, according to the probabilities. Villarreal await them in the semi-final, for which they are big favourites to progress but Unai Emery's side have shown their toughness in this competition already having beaten Juventus and Bayern Munich. If they reach their second successive final, Man City could be waiting for them if they come through their tie with Real Madrid. That could set up a date with destiny on May 28 in Paris, where Liverpool could be one game away from the quadruple. They couldn't, could they? *Probability calculated using percentage-adjusted figures which eliminates Sky Bet's margin on the market.

But it would appear the group headed by LA Dodgers part-owner Boehly - which includes backing from Clearlake Capital, a US investment firm - is in the ascendancy with regard to the takeover. Chelsea have told the consortium led by Stephen Pagliuca, part-owner of the NBA's Boston Celtics and Serie A's Atalanta, it is not the preferred bidder. This latest development is a blow to the other remaining group left in the bidding, led by Sir Martin Broughton, the former Liverpool and British Airways chairman, which includes the billionaire Crystal Palace shareholders Dave Blitzer and Josh Harris. Chelsea hope to have a new owner in place by the end of May. Once the Raine Group selects a preferred bidder, the government must then grant a new licence to allow the sale to be completed.

Abramovich has owned Chelsea for 19 years, leading the club to 21 trophies in a glittering tenure. As the Boehly consortium advances with its takeover of Chelsea, Sky Sports takes a look at who else tried to buy Chelsea... Sir Martin Broughton, the former British Airways and Liverpool FC chairman, and Lord Coe, the former British Olympian turned sports administrator and businessman, were fronting a bid that had the financial firepower of Josh Harris and Dave Blitzer, two wealthy American financiers, behind it. Lewis Hamilton was one of the investors backing Broughton's attempt to acquire the west London club and is understood to have committed £10m to the bid. Tennis legend Serena Williams is also among the backers of the Broughton consortium, spearheaded by the former Liverpool chairman. A group led by the Ricketts family, which owns the Chicago Cubs, and the Citadel hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, with the US investment bank Lazard was in the final four but withdrew its offer last month. The plans fell apart due to members of the consortium being unable to agree on the final make up of the deal. The Ricketts bid was unpopular among many Chelsea fans due to discriminatory emails sent by Joe Ricketts, the family's patriarch, in 2009, and some had staged a demonstration at Stamford Bridge before the defeat to Brentford earlier this month. The Ricketts family has said it ""rejects any form of hate in the strongest possible terms"". Sky Sports News understands the Ricketts consortium's withdrawal was not down to the protests but rather the structure of the deal. The final consortium was fronted by Steve Pagliuca, part-owner of the NBA's Boston Celtics and Serie A's Atalanta, which includes support from Larry Tanenbaum. Pagluica is a private equity billionaire who has made a fortune from his career at Bain Capital. Among the group's other co-investors are said to be John Burbank, founder of the San Francisco hedge fund Passport Capital, and Eduardo Saverin, the Facebook co-founder who was the first investor in the tech behemoth.

Ratcliffe held talks with Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck on Thursday and submitted the offer for the Stamford Bridge club on Friday. The 69-year-old explored in detail a possible bid for the Blues back in 2019, only to buy French club Nice instead. But a spokesperson for Ratcliffe confirmed the British business magnate's offer to buy Chelsea, with the bid understood now to represent the highest for the club. ""We put an offer in this morning,"" Ratcliffe told The Times. ""We are the only British bid. Our motives are simply to try and create a very fine club in London. We have no profit motive because we make our money in other ways.""

Abramovich has owned Chelsea for 19 years, leading the club to 21 trophies in a glittering tenure. ""Sir Jim Ratcliffe, chairman of Ineos, has made a formal bid for Chelsea FC, for £4.25bn. £2.5bn is committed to the Charitable Trust to support victims of the war, with £1.75bn committed to investment directly into the club over the next 10 years. ""This is a British bid, for a British club. ""We believe that a club is bigger than its owners who are temporary custodians of a great tradition. With responsibility to the fans and the community. ""That is why we are committing to spending £1.75bn over 10 years that will be for the direct benefit of the club. ""We will invest in Stamford Bridge to make it a world-class stadium, befitting of Chelsea FC. ""This will be organic and ongoing so that we will not move away from the home of Chelsea and risk losing the support of loyal fans. ""We will continue to invest in the team to ensure we have a first-class squad of the world's greatest players, coaches and support staff, in the men's and women's games. ""And we hope to continue to invest in the academy to provide opportunity for talented youngsters to develop into first class players. ""We believe that London should have a club that reflects the stature of the city. One that is held in the same regard as Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich. We intend Chelsea to be that club. ""We are making this investment as fans of the beautiful game - not as a means to turn a profit. We do that with our core businesses. The club is rooted in its community and its fans. And it is our intention to invest in Chelsea FC for that reason. ""No further comment will be made from Sir Jim or INEOS during the bidding process."" Sky Sports News' chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol: ""This is a twist in the tale. It's not entirely unexpected because we've known for a long time that Sir Jim Radcliffe has wanted to buy an English football club. He's a Chelsea season ticket holder and there's been lots of talk of him wanting to buy Chelsea in the past. ""A few weeks ago when Chelsea was put up for sale because Roman Abramovich was sanctioned, we - along with lots of other reporters - got in touch with Sir Jim Radcliffe's associates and representatives and asked if he was interested in buying Chelsea this time around. ""The message was very clear - he wasn't interested and wouldn't be bidding for Chelsea. Yes, he does invest in football clubs, but the feeling was he didn't think there was any value and that Chelsea were overpriced. The feeling was he wasn't the kind of person that was going to pay two, three, four billion pounds for a football club. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""But obviously, something has changed in the last few weeks. He has seen how much interest there is in buying Chelsea, especially from US sports investors, US hedge funds, US financiers and maybe he's thought 'all these guys think there's a lot of money to be made from Chelsea, maybe this is something I should be getting involved with as well'. ""We should point out this was a story first reported by Matt Dickinson in The Times maybe about 90 minutes ago. What is also interesting is that according to Matt and the people he has spoken to said Jim Ratcliffe doesn't see this as a way to make money. We need to be a bit careful because when you're as rich as Jim Radcliffe is, you invest your money wisely do he must think it's a good investment. ""But I don't think his priority or overriding concern is making money out of Chelsea. He obviously thinks it's a good investment, but I think there's an emotional connection to the club as well and he feels he can be an owner of it, a guardian and steward of the club and invest in it going forward. ""I know some people might be thinking the deadline has passed so how has he been doing this so late, but I think he's been playing a very clever game. We've always said there was a deadline to put bids in, but it wasn't a hard and fast deadline. If you picked up the phone and got in touch with the Raine Group and put in a bid after the deadline, they were always going listen to what you have to say. ""He's already got interest in football. He's made his money from a company called Ineos, which is a massive petrochemical company. He's also set up a company called Ineos football and that company, he invested in the French team Nice and also the Swiss team FC Lausanne, so he already owns two football clubs. ""If he was to buy Chelsea, you couldn't have a situation where Nice and Chelsea were playing in the Champions League, that wouldn't be allowed under UEFA rules. I think one would be able to play in the Champions League and the other wouldn't be able to play any higher than the Europa Conference League. ""His strategy up until today has always been that he bought Nice because he thought there was great value in it. it didn't cost him much, I think he bought it from Chinese owners so he's buying club that he thinks there is value in. ""With Chelsea, he's paying a massive blockbuster price - £2.5bn plus a commitment to invest £1.75bn over the next decade in the infrastructure and the team, redeveloping Stamford Bridge as well. it's a massive investment. ""If I was a Chelsea supporter, this is the bid I'd be most excited about because this is somebody you can relate to in the same way that a lot of Chelsea supporters related to Roman Abramovich. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Jim Radcliffe is a very rich man, he's made all his own money… People are saying he's worth twice as much as Abramovich is at the moment. ""A lot of Chelsea supporters like the idea that they're owned by somebody British, somebody who is a Chelsea season ticket holder and has his own money, rather than the fact that they would be owned by a group of US investors who you would have to say, despite everything they say in public, you wonder why they are buying the club and it's because they spot a business opportunity. ""I'm sure Jim Ratcliffe does as well, but I think he's got a connection with the club as well. ""Significantly, he says he's got the money ready to go. He can pay for it this weekend if they accept his offer, he will put the money on the table and buy Chelsea. ""He also says he's been in touch with the UK Government because they need to provide this special licence for Abramovich to sell Chelsea and he'd need to pass the Premier League's owners and directors test as well. There's still a few more hurdles to get over. ""The big question then is what happens to the £4bn? Because Abramovich is not allowed to get one penny from the proceeds of this sale. It's still very opaque, different people telling us different things - the money is going to go to a frozen bank account, it'll go to charity - this is something we have to keep a close eye on going forward.""

The final obstacle in Liverpool's quest to reach a third Champions League final in five seasons sees them head to Spain with a 2-0 advantage after last week's comprehensive first-leg victory at Anfield. Despite holding a commanding advantage, Klopp is under no illusions there is still a job to be done and is relishing the challenge that only Champions League semi-finals produce. ""We know that it is half-time,"" Klopp told his pre-match press conference. ""In the best possible way we have to ignore the result from the first leg. If it were a cup game where only one game decided, and we had to go to Villarreal, we would try to win there. ""We know they will give all they have, that is absolutely clear. With all the things Unai said after the game… it's going to be a tough one but that is completely fine. Champions League semi-finals should be tough; we never expect them to be easy and this will not be easy. But we played a good game at home and we better play a good game there as well."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Klopp continued: ""At this moment, a Champions League semi-final is the most important game you can play. Whatever happened in the last few weeks or will happen in the next few weeks is not important, for this moment is clear. ""You never know if you will reach a semi-final again or if we will ever have the chance again to go to the final, you never know. We have an exceptional team here and nothing is for granted. You need luck in moments and all these sorts of things, so you better treat it carefully and be ready, and we will be ready. How likely is Liverpool Quadruple?

But between now and then there are 95, or however many minutes to play, and I'm looking forward to it."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Villarreal boss Unai Emery has warned his players will make Liverpool suffer at the Estadio de la Ceramica after failing to lay on glove on the six-time European champions in last week's first leg. Klopp is adamant Liverpool are prepared for such an examination in order to progress through their Champions League semi-final and reach the third final of his tenure on Merseyside. ""We have to be ready to suffer,"" Klopp added. ""Not being a goal down - which can happen - but giving the game the right direction. ""A good example was Newcastle. The crowd was very passionate but we didn't let it happen, which was the biggest quality for this game. It wasn't a show of football brilliance. Of course we could have scored more goals but how clear-cut the performance was incredible. ""Yes we have to be emotional, ready to play the best game ever, but knowing it will not happen in moments. Suffering doesn't mean you suffer for long, you suffer and then you react."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Klopp added: ""Maturity and experience are very important, but they are not the only decisive things. You can be old and know everything about football but unable to play anymore, so that cannot be useful. ""Everything what we are will be required tomorrow night, that's it. We have to be ready to play a top, top game because they will go for us. They will high press, they will try to play much more football than we allowed them in the first game. ""Unai will for sure try to adapt a few things to our style. It will be really interesting. Maturity will be important but it's not the only thing."" Villarreal manager Unai Emery admits his side need to play the perfect game if they are to shock Liverpool to reach the club's first Champions League final. The former Arsenal boss was reminded their opponents had lost just three of 56 matches in a quadruple-chasing season. ""I didn't want to hear those details but I did,"" he said. ""It is a difficult task but we are working on the game. We need to play a perfect game. ""We need to find our excellence in certain things and maybe achieve something no one has achieved, which is this kind of comeback. We will try to find some weak spots, something that no one has done this season."" There was some positive news for Emery with striker Gerard Moreno, who missed the first leg, back after injury, although they will be missing former Bournemouth winger Arnaut Danjuma who is ill. ""Gerard trained with the rest of the group today,"" said the Villarreal boss. ""I don't know to what extent he will be fit for contention. We will not take any risks."" Sky Sports' Gary Neville: ""I really enjoyed the Liverpool-Villarreal first leg. Villarreal were massive underdogs, defending so deep in the 4-4-2 system. I thought highly of Liverpool and their persistence. ""Liverpool were doing the right things. Liverpool are a team who can win in different ways. They can outbox you; they can go toe to toe with you, punch for punch and they can be patient. Liverpool have demonstrated that in the last few years, they can wait, they can pass it around, they don't get panicky. ""I remember that game where they lost the title under Brendan Rodgers- they didn't have the experience to handle a different type of opponent. When Chelsea held back that day, they got very frustrated. ""I think it was a really good performance from Liverpool in the first leg, it was really professional. They should win that game, no doubt. Liverpool certainly [will qualify] - and that doesn't mean I don't respect Villarreal."" Sky Sports' Gary Neville: ""Liverpool are seven games from a Quadruple - seven games from a quadruple. That is the closest I think that anybody will ever have been to a Quadruple. I might be wrong. Someone will probably prove me wrong, but I can't think of a time. ""If Liverpool were to do it that would be unprecedented. Unprecedented achievements. So they, along with Manchester City, are on the brink of greatness.""

The issue was discussed by UEFA at its Executive Committee meeting last week, and a vote will be taken at the UEFA Congress in Vienna on May 10. It is expected to be ratified then. When it is, for the first time in history, European football qualification will be based on something other than the season that has just finished. The proposals mean that, from 2024, there will be an extra two places in the Champions League reserved for European clubs who have failed to qualify via their domestic league, but who have traditionally done well in Europe's elite club competition. To use hypothetical examples from this current Premier League season, it would mean that if Chelsea, as reigning European champions, finished fifth in the Premier League, they would nevertheless stand a good chance of still qualifying for a Champions League spot for the following season. They currently rank fourth on UEFA's 10-year club coefficient. However, if West Ham were to finish fifth, they would not gain a place in the Champions League because they don't have a strong enough historical record in Europe. In fact, there are 89 clubs ahead of them in the 10-year rankings. One senior executive at a Premier League club told me that this means, for the very first time, the introduction of a ""two-tier system"" - one for the biggest clubs, one for the rest. CL wildcards - your questions answered PL or CL? What do Man City and Liverpool need to win? CL reforms 'Super League via back door', warns fans group Find out more about Sky Sports It's important to stress the new rules won't come into play until 2024. That same executive says there is also the danger of ""a creep effect"", where more and more places in the Champions League are allocated by historical European performance and not by current domestic success. ""It's almost like this is 'European Super League Lite', and the fear is that two might become four, might become eight - with the Champions League becoming more and more of a closed shop,"" they said. The idea that most worries other clubs is the idea of ""leap-frogging"" whereby a team finishing fifth in the Premier League automatically goes into the Europa League, and yet a team finishing behind them in sixth could be ""bumped"" into a more profitable Champions League spot - if they have a better ""coefficient"", or history in European football. Sky Sports News understands all 20 Premier League clubs unanimously asked league officials in 2021 to oppose UEFA's proposal for wildcard places that might lead to ""leap-frogging"" and the inevitable sporting integrity issues. It's thought the Premier League is still lobbying UEFA, via the European Leagues group, for the idea to be removed, with some apparent success. One such meeting happened on Tuesday, I'm told. As a result, it now looks likely that ""leap-frogging"" will be banned under the new UEFA plans, but the coefficient calculation will remain. That allows the possibility for the Big Six in England to all qualify for the Champions League each season, so long as they finish in the top six places in the Premier League. The sixth-placed team will qualify so long as the fifth-placed team does, and so long as their coefficient is among the top two from all of England, Spain, Italy and Germany. In the last year since the European Super League collapsed, a number of officials have told me that the ""coefficient qualification issue"" was a hugely controversial piece of football legislation that was offered in the background to help appease the biggest clubs in Europe and England. The hope was that, if the big clubs had some sort of safety net for missing out on Champions League qualification, they would drop their plans for a breakaway league. It worked. With the exception of Juventus, Barcelona and Real Madrid, the other nine elite clubs all backed out of the European Super League when offered this ""face-saving compromise"", and when confronted with the huge backlash from supporters. However, there has always been strong feeling within the bulk of Premier League clubs, I'm told, that this plan for wildcards to help the biggest clubs qualify for the Champions League is against the spirit of the game. They felt last year, and still do now, that the hugely significant changes had sneaked in almost unnoticed amid the noise and controversy surrounding the European Super League. One official has told us: ""They (Europe's elite clubs) got what they wanted from UEFA. They wanted a safety net, in case they missed out on qualification, and that's exactly what they are going to be given. ""The European Super League was a sideshow - it couldn't practically happen. But a ""super league"" within UEFA, via the Champions League, very much could happen."" In addition, in the aftermath of the collapse of the European Super League, the Premier League vowed to introduce a new Owners Charter which would provide legal guarantees that clubs couldn't try to break away in the future. The Government at the time said it was fully behind those plans to introduce ""appropriate legislation"" to protect football from breakaway leagues. In the year since the collapse of the European Super League, the Charter is yet to be agreed upon, or put to a vote. In fact, whilst it was on the Premier League shareholders' agenda in the first few months after the European Super League, it isn't any longer. Sky Sports News has been told by one club executive that the Owners Charter has been ""kicked into the long grass for now"" with no prospect of it being voted upon at any of the upcoming Premier League shareholders' meetings. Sources say it is simply too sensitive a subject between clubs to discuss right now. In the meantime, UEFA is still haggling over the final details of how the wildcard system will work, and there may be compromises in terms of the fixture congestion that the new Champions League format poses to the English football calendar. But compromises to the 'coefficient system' I'm told, are very unlikely. The idea of two extra wildcard places for the tournament is set in stone. And traditionally, whatever is put before the UEFA Executive Committee is voted through, so big changes are afoot next month. Another controversial issue still being discussed is the idea that the winners of the FA Cup might be able to claim a place in the Champions League. If there was to be a fifth Champions League spot available for the FA Cup winners, that would be unanimously applauded, I'm told. But that's not what's on offer. The proposal is that the FA Cup winners will only get a Champions League spot if their European coefficient is high enough - if they have traditionally done well in Europe. Again, this favours the big clubs. Of the current FA Cup semi-finalists, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Crystal Palace, Palace alone would miss out on the new European wildcard system if they were to lift the trophy. City, Liverpool and Chelsea's success in Europe would mean they would be very likely to get a wildcard into the Champions League, if they won the FA Cup (and didn't finish in the Premier League top four). And so, as one executive put it me, you could have two teams lining up at Wembley for the final potentially ""with very different prizes on offer to each."" ""The same prize has to be awarded whoever wins a trophy, and the idea you can get ""bumped"" is just wrong."" Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

How Premier League could have nine teams in European competitions next season,"The race for Europe is on but which teams make it - and how many - is still to be decided. With the Premier League campaign reaching its climax, we look at: There are seven European spots open to English sides - although that number could rise to nine and the amount of teams in each individual competition can shift. As a basis: However, because this season the FA Cup winner will be either Liverpool or Chelsea, and both those teams look set to finish in the top four, their Europa League qualifying spot for winning the FA Cup will be passed down to the next highest Premier League finisher who doesn't qualify for Europe. Similarly, because Liverpool won the Carabao Cup and are set to finish in the top four, their Europa Conference League qualifying spot from that competition will go to the next highest Premier League finisher without European football. So that means sides which finish sixth and seventh in the Premier League table are in contention for a place in either the Europa League or Europa Conference League next season. Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal would qualify for the Champions League by finishing in the Premier League's top four positions. Tottenham would go into the Europa League, along with Manchester United (who would get in thanks to Chelsea or Liverpool passing on their spot from winning the FA Cup). Seventh-placed West Ham would qualify for the Europa Conference League, thanks to Liverpool's Carabao Cup winner's spot being passed on. Manchester City and Liverpool have pulled clear at the top of the Premier League, and while their battle to win the Premier League title continues, they don't have to worry about Champions League qualification. Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp will still be plotting how to win this year's competition, and could meet in the final, but they already have their places in next season's tournament wrapped up through the league. Meanwhile, the last two spots in the top four are still up for grabs with Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham in contention with four games remaining. However, whatever the outcome, it will be a top-six finish at the very least for Chelsea and Arsenal, who return to European competition after missing out last season. Although not mathematically done yet, Spurs have all but guaranteed a Europa League spot with a nine-point gap between them and seventh-placed West Ham, who have just three matches left to play this season. Antonio Conte's side also have a far superior goal difference to the Hammers. The battle for the final Europa League spot continues between Man Utd and West Ham, while Wolves also have their eyes on finishing seventh and potentially securing a place in the Europa Conference League. If Manchester City or Liverpool win the Champions League they will automatically qualify for the competition's group stages next season. That is irrespective of where they finish in the Premier League table. If they qualify for the competition through two methods - ie: they win it and finish in the top four - there is no extra Champions League spot created for another team to fill and the number of Premier League clubs in next season's Champions League will remain at four. The Premier League could have a maximum of five teams in the Champions League next season, though, if West Ham won the Europa League and finished outside the top four. Winning that competition qualifies them for the Champions League group stages. If Leicester win the Europa Conference League they will automatically qualify for next season's Europa League - another additional European spot. That means, if West Ham and Leicester win their competitions and finish outside the Premier League's top seven there will be nine English sides in European competition next season. The nine sides would be: the top four and West Ham in the Champions League, fifth and sixth place, plus Leicester, in the Europa League, and seventh place in the Europa Conference League. But if Leicester were to win the Europa Conference League and finish seventh - the place set to be rewarded with a Europa Conference League spot - there would be no English side in the Europa Conference League next season, as Leicester would be bumped up to the Europa League. That happened in Spain last season with Sevilla and no La Liga side involved in the Europa Conference League. With Liverpool and Manchester City in the Champions League semi-finals, there's a good chance an English side would win the tournament - but that would have no impact on European qualification, with both sides set to finish in the top four. West Ham are into the semis of the Europa League and an additional Champions League spot is up for grabs if they win that competition. Their Europa Conference League spot for finishing seventh would disappear.Leicester - 10 points off seventh with two games in hand - could be playing European football again next year if they progress from their semi-final and win the Europa Conference League to earn an additional spot in the Europa League. Regardless of any permutation, no side finishing eighth in the Premier League will qualify for Europe, unless they've won a domestic or European cup. Eighth-placed Wolves would be the highest-finishing Premier League team to miss out on European football, although they are just three points behind West Ham and five off Manchester United, with a game in hand on both.

The 24-year-old, who has been with Bournemouth since a 2018 move from Sheffield United, withdrew from the most recent Wales squad because of illness and confirmed the significance of it on Wednesday in a statement on his social media channels. Hodgkin Lymphoma is a cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, part of the body's immune system, and mainly affects young adults in their early 20s or in much older adults over the age of 70. Brooks said: ""This is a very difficult message for me to write. ""I have been diagnosed with Stage II Hodgkin Lymphoma and will begin a course of treatment next week. ""Although this has come as a shock to myself and my family, the prognosis is a positive one and I am confident that I will make a full recovery and be back playing as soon as possible. ""I'd like to show my appreciation to the doctors, nurses, consultants and staff who have been treating me for their professionalism, warmth and understanding during this period. ""I want to thank everyone at the Football Association of Wales because without the swift attention of their medical team we may not have detected the illness. ""I'd also like to say thank you to AFC Bournemouth for all of their support and assistance this past week. ""Although I appreciate that there will be media attention and interest, I would like to ask that my privacy is respected in the coming months and I will share updates on my progress when I am able to do so. ""In the meantime, thank you to everyone for their messages of support - it means so much and will continue to do so in the months ahead. ""I look forward to seeing you all again and playing the sport I love very soon."" Bournemouth chief executive Neill Blake said: ""Everyone at AFC Bournemouth will do everything possible to help support David and his family during his recovery. ""We're not putting any timescales on his return; we will give David all the time he needs to get well and will do everything that we possibly can to help with that. ""I know everyone will be keen to show their love and support for David which will help him immensely as he recovers, but we also urge you all to respect his and his family's privacy during this time.""

WSL leaders Chelsea beat Tottenham 2-1 on Thursday night to move four points ahead of Arsenal in the title race with just a few weeks left of the season. But Eidevall, whose side have a game in hand and three matches left to play in the league, says he did not watch Chelsea's game and aimed a dig at Arsenal's title rivals. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player He said: ""I think for me I didn't focus on Chelsea when they were rearranging all their fixtures in January, so Sam Kerr didn't have to miss any games because of the Asia Cup. ""I don't focus on them now, either. I just focus on Arsenal, getting as many points as possible, and then we see where that leaves us in the table."" Chelsea asked to have a match against Tottenham postponed in January due to a high number of Covid cases and injuries in their squad. Their match against Everton was also pushed back, but that was at the request of the opposition, also due to a high number of Covid cases and injuries. Women's Super League table Women's Super League fixtures Women's Super League results How to follow the WSL on Sky Sports Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Arsenal were without Lydia Williams, Caitlin Foord, Steph Catley and Mana Iwabuchi due to the Asia Cup in January, and subsequently lost to Birmingham during that period while other games were postponed. ""We were one of the few teams who chose to play that weekend,"" added Eidevall. ""I am very disappointed with the lack of transparency in the reasons behind postponing games and how long they take to reschedule."" Arsenal can close the gap on Chelsea to one point with a win against Aston Villa on Sunday, but are relying on Birmingham and Manchester United to trip Chelsea up in their final two games. As the Gunners have a game in hand, they just need Chelsea to draw one of their final two games, should Eidevall's side finish the season with three wins. ""I've seen both teams Birmingham and Man United and everyone who has followed our season knows that they have both been beating us,"" said Eidevall. ""I've seen their qualities on those occasions. I've also seen that when Birmingham was playing at home against us, and I saw it happen to us in the County Cup, when United was playing away against us. So it's two very capable teams and in a very tough league."" Sky Sports' Karen Carney:""The Champions League might be a factor come the end of the season. Chelsea went out early, they could focus on the league. Arsenal were still in it and playing against real top opposition and had to focus on that. Their squad rotation had to change, they had injuries and that might be a factor.""I think the Birmingham game [for Chelsea on Sunday, live on Sky Sports] is hard… Birmingham are fighting for it [to stay in the WSL] and everyone thinks they're down but internally, they don't. Going there is going to be tough and you have to stay concentrated.""But with the squad Chelsea have, with the way they're going and having to go through resilient moments this week, I think it's Chelsea's [title].""

A hugely-significant 1-0 win came courtesy of Richarlison's fourth goal in five matches and a brilliant second-half goalkeeping performance from Jordan Pickford. Lampard's side have taken 10 points from the last 12 at home and a raucous Goodison, both outside before the game and inside throughout, will play a huge part in their future with two more home matches remaining. Burnley and Leeds, with an inferior goal difference, are only two points away and Everton have a match in hand - at home to Crystal Palace three days before the final day of the season - so their destiny remains in their hands. However, Lampard remains cautious. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""I don't know what is in your hands around the bottom of the table,"" the Everton boss added. ""If it was Liverpool and Manchester City you'd think they would win every game and then in your hands is great at that point. But are we expecting Burnley to win every game? At the minute maybe yeah! Are we expecting Leeds to win every game? Everton fixtures Chelsea fixtures Premier League table Get Sky Sports ""It think it is hard to say what is in our hands and that's because we can only control certain things - and that's when we play. ""That's the difficult thing about yesterday, we can't control Burnley. We can't control Leeds. We can only control ourselves. Of the five games we will have to control ourselves well enough to get enough points. We don't know what that (total) is. ""My feeling is there is a long way to go."" May 7 - Leicester City (a) May 11 - Watford (a) May 15 - Brentford (a) May 19 - Crystal Palace (h) May 22 - Arsenal (a) Ahead of the game, Lampard felt it was time to spell out the reality of the club's precarious situation to his players ahead of the visit of Chelsea and he was delighted with their response. Burnley's surprise late comeback against Watford on Saturday had left Lampard's side five points adrift of safety heading into the game and the manager decided he needed to address it before they arrived at Goodison Park. ""I think it was an important moment to talk about the reality of the situation,"" he said. ""You can keep telling the players to believe. Then there are other times when the demands are this. ""To be good lads is not enough to stay in this league. It is clear what the table looks like. ""My feeling was we needed an extra boost, an extra bit of attention, and to be fair the players delivered that. ""I mentioned it (the Burnley result) briefly to the players this morning because I wanted to make sure it wasn't a fear or a lack of hope with the points difference."" Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp:   ""It’s an absolutely incredible win for Everton. They were running out of lifelines.   “I think Frank Lampard would have certainly taken a point before the game but they were waiting for that one moment.   “That will feel so good and Lampard will now know how important that home form is with Brentford and Crystal Palace to come at Goodison Park.” Richarlison may have grabbed the goal that sealed victory for Everton, but arguably more important on this occasion was the performance of Jordan Pickford, who after facing no shots on target for almost an hour, then produced an impromptu cameo to keep Chelsea at bay and the lead intact in the second half. His superb denial of Cesar Azpilicueta, scrambling across his goal having been beaten by Mason Mount was the pick of the bunch and described by Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp as the save of the season. ""The one to deny Azpilicueta is the save of the season, Redknapp said. ""It was magnificent. We've given Pickford a lot of stick in the past, but he was brilliant."" Sky Sports' Graeme Souness added: ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves. Some of the saves he's not entitled to get anywhere near them."" Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford after his man of the match display: ""It is what I am there for, and it is a team effort at the end of the day, it is all about getting three points. I really enjoyed it but that is what I am there to do, help the team. ""We cannot get too carried away, we have to keep fighting and the fans have played a massive part."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel was left to bemoan another individual mistake - Cesar Azpilicueta losing possession on the edge of his own penalty area - which has left them anxiously looking over their shoulder in the race for a top-four place. ""What can I do? To give a goal away is the worst thing that can happen to you,"" he said. ""It is our responsibility. It happens too often. We struggle to play without big mistakes and that is why we struggle to have results. ""In the last few matches we struggled to have a clean sheet, the last four matches we have had one clean sheet. ""Very disappointed. We knew what was coming from the opponent: the crowd and the way they would approach the match. No one was surprised.""

Runaway leaders Fulham secured promotion to the Premier League at the first time of asking after a 3-0 win over Preston on April 19 and then lifted the title after a crushing 7-0 win over play-off chasing Luton on May 2. They were then joined by Bournemouth on May 3, after Scott Parker's side scored a late goal to sink Nottingham Forest and make their six-point cushion inside the top two unassailable with one game to spare. And with the relegation places having been settled for weeks now, too, that leaves just the remaining four places in the top six up for grabs. But with Huddersfield having secured one and Forest another, there are two berths remaining, with Sheffield United, Luton, Middlesbrough and Millwall left to contest them.

For extended spells throughout the season, he scored so frequently that it looked as though he would surpass Glenn Murray's benchmark of 30 by some length, yet unwelcome barren spells meant a single goal in a 3-1 win over Bristol City on May 8, 2021 took him to a historic tally. Given the fact it took eight seasons for Murray's record to fall, it did seem as though Toney's would stand for somewhat longer. But history shows that Aleksandar Mitrovic thrives in the second tier, and so it has proved all season. And now, he has written himself into the history books by scoring his 32nd and 33rd league goals of the season in Fulham's 2-1 win against Peterborough at Craven Cottage. Even more astonishing is the fact he has managed to trump Toney's feat with 14 games to play. Here, we take a look at how the Cottagers' prized asset rampaged his way to a new record. The 2019/20 season was a successful one for both player and club, as Mitrovic finished as joint-Golden Boot winner - alongside Brentford's Ollie Watkins - with 26 goals and Fulham pipped the Bees to the Premier League when they won the Championship play-off final 2-1 after extra time at Wembley on August 4, 2020. Mitro breaks Champ record as Fulham beat Peterborough Championship top scorers Championship table Get Sky Sports It was the second-best return of his career and there was no reason to suggest he was incapable of replicating similar form - albeit probably not quite so prolific - on his return to the Premier League. But 2020/21 soon became a slog. He scored one in the Carabao Cup against Ipswich and two goals in a 4-3 defeat away at Leeds in the second league game of the campaign, but then failed to hit the net for the best part of seven months until he scored Fulham's only goal in a 3-1 defeat to Aston Villa. In fact, throughout the season, he scored more international goals for Serbia (7) than he did for his club (4). There is a very clear correlation between his goals and Fulham's success and so Fulham suffered immediate relegation back to the second tier having won just five games and scored just 27 goals. Serbia did not take part in Euro 2020 last summer, so Mitrovic had an extended period in which to prepare before lining up for the Cottagers' opener against Middlesbrough on August 8. His immediate impact consisted of nothing more than a first-minute booking in an eventual 1-1 draw on the banks of the River Thames. But then came the first of many, during a trip to Huddersfield six days later. With nine minutes on the clock, Terriers goalkeeper Ryan Schofield chested down a long ball forward quite impressively, swung a leg to try and launch the ball upfield, though could only get enough purchase on it to find a lurking Mitrovic, who slipped as he tried to slot home, yet still managed to loop the ball over the line. Just like that, his magic touch was back. And it was a sign of things to come, as Marco Silva's imposing, well-drilled and deadly side breezed their way to a crushing 5-1 win. He then converted a Fabio Carvalho pull-back against Millwall, before being left unmarked to head in the opener in a 2-0 win over Hull and then made it four goals from as many games when he mopped up from a yard or so out when Harry Wilson unselfishly squared for his team-mate when arriving into the six-yard box at breakneck speed. Following the September international break, the Serbian hit six in six games - which included a glorious first half hat-trick in a 3-1 win over Swansea at Craven Cottage on September 29 - taking his haul to 12 goals in 10 games. Yet as impressive as that was, a spell between October and November was where he really got going. A clinical finish on the turn and a superb glancing header he made look easy helped Fulham to a 4-1 west London derby win over QPR, with one more against Cardiff, two more against Nottingham Forest and then another hat-trick, this time against promotion rivals West Brom, just for good measure. It was no surprise that he triumphed in perhaps one of the most one-sided Sky Bet Player of the Month contests on record as a result. ""I have a lot of quality around me in this team, a lot of creative players who make a lot of chances for me, so I have to thank them for helping me to score as many goals as I did in October,"" he said upon collecting the award. As he referenced there, many of his goals come from inside the box; a flicked header from a cross or a low, composed finish after a free-flowing attack. But he has shown time and time again that he is more than content to set up a team-mate instead, with two assists in a shock 7-0 win over Blackburn on November 3. Indeed, this selflessness - similar to that of Toney, who got 10 last season - is illustrated by the fact he currently has seven assists to his name, taking his goal involvement figure to 40 in 30 games. Silva's men returned to the top of the Championship after a 4-1 win over struggling Barnsley on November 17, but then started to go off the boil after they reached the summit, drawing four games and losing one in the lead-up to Christmas. As mentioned earlier, when Mitrovic struggles in front of goal, Fulham do too - and he scored just once during that stretch. What was more disappointing was the fact Covid-related issues saw them play just three league games between December 11 and January 11. The lay-off served both player and club well, as he returned with two in a 7-0 demolition of Reading and yet another first half hat-trick in a 6-2 comeback win against Bristol City. In spite of the form of their frontman, Fulham have shown that they are much more than a one-man team and there is no over-reliance to speak of. None of the six goals in the 6-2 win over Birmingham were scored or even assisted by him, while they overcame Stoke 3-2 without him in the squad, with Rodrigo Muniz proving himself to be an able deputy. He tapped in his 28th in a 1-1 draw against Blackpool on January 29 and reached 30 with two in a 3-0 win over Millwall 10 days later. In that game, he first lashed in a Neco Williams pull-back, then mopped up from just a few yards out when Carvalho's shot was parried into his path by Bart Bialkowski. Williams was the provider when Mitrovic equalled Toney's record in a 1-0 win at Hull, too. The Liverpool loanee floated an inviting ball into the penalty area, where the frontman glanced a header past Matt Ingram from no less than 15 yards out. In front of the Sky Sports cameras on Saturday February 19, he missed two gilt-edged chances against Huddersfield to net the all-important goal, but then four days later, he made history. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player As struggling Peterborough arrived at the Cottage, days after the departure of manager Darren Ferguson, Mitrovic must have been licking his lips. And, with all eyes on him, he delivered under pressure, slamming home a penalty he won himself with 28 minutes gone. But he was not finished there. He helped himself to a second, connecting with a Neeskens Kebano cross from the left flank and effortlessly finding the net with a nonchalant sidefooted volley. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  As of February 23, with 33 goals in 30 league games, Mitrovic has scored an average of 1.1 goals per game. With 14 games to play, if he carries on scoring at the same frequency, he will score 15 more and reach 48, which will smash the original record by a whopping 17 goals.

The Serbian frontman was presented with the award at the Grosvenor House Hotel, Park Lane, as the end of a historic personal campaign draws to a close. The 27-year-old has scored 41 times so far which saw him break the record for the most goals scored in a Championship season. His strikes, coupled with the creativity of team-mate Wilson, who has contributed 16 assists and scored 10 himself, have powered Fulham to the top of the division. Marco Silva's Cottagers were promoted back to the Premier League at the first time of asking following a 3-0 win over Preston earlier this week. Mitrovic beat off competition from Fulham team-mate Harry Wilson and Bournemouth's Dominic Solanke to win the award. Meanwhile in Sky Bet League One, MK Dons' Scott Twine took home the coveted prize. It has been a remarkable season for the 22-year-old, too, with his eye-catching tally of 16 goals and 13 assists proving invaluable to Liam Manning's side, who remain in automatic promotion contention ahead of the final day of the season on April 30.

United are keen to sign a winger during this transfer window and, while their first choice is Sancho, Dembele represents a strong alternative. The 23-year-old was a club-record signing for Barcelona when he arrived from Borussia Dortmund for €105m (£95.75m) in August 2017. He has won two La Liga titles and the Copa del Rey during his three seasons in Spain, but has been restricted to 75 appearances in all competitions by a series of injuries. The France international is one of four alternative options United are working on if they are unable to sign Sancho, along with Watford's Ismaila Sarr, Real Madrid's Luka Jovic and free agent Edinson Cavani. On Tuesday, United had a bid for Sancho worth up to £91.3m (€100m) rejected by Borussia Dortmund. The offer was for an initial £73m, rising to up to £91.3m, which fell short of Dortmund's £108m valuation. United are now considering whether to return with an improved bid for the England international. Transfer Centre LIVE! The making of Van de Beek Man Utd transfer rumours Man Utd's £91.3m Sancho bid rejected Dortmund set United a deadline of August 10 to agree a deal for Sancho, and have stated on several occasions the winger will not be leaving now that date has passed. Sancho has not travelled with the rest of the Dortmund squad for the German Super Cup match against Bayern Munich on Wednesday due to a ""respiratory infection"". He has tested negative for Covid-19. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player If United do manage to sign a winger before Monday's transfer deadline, it could have repercussions for Daniel James, who has played for just 45 minutes this season. The 22-year-old was the subject of a loan offer from Leeds last week and, while he wants to stay and fight for his place at Old Trafford, the arrival of another winger could lead to a reassessment of his future at the club.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports News reporter Dharmesh Sheth told The Transfer Show: ""Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman had some interesting things to say earlier today regarding Dembele and Manchester United, saying: ""They are decisions on part of the club and the player"". He went on to say that while he is there, he will count on Dembele. ""It appears Barca seem much more open to do business on Dembele than Dortmund are with Sancho. It's definitely one to watch because it seems with what Koeman is saying, that he hasn't ruled out Demebele leaving the Nou Camp. ""It is thought United are working on at least four alternatives to Sancho... While Cavani and Jovic aren't seen as like-for-like replacements, I think Manchester United's priority is to strengthen the depth of that forward line. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""With Cavani, Man United would have to take into account his wages and his age - he's 33 years old - and also the length of the contract he would want at this stage of his career. As for Jovic, the Real Madrid boss Zineidne Zidane won't rule out a departure. There are reports coming from Italy that he's been offered to Roma. ""Then there is Sarr. If Manchester United fail to get Sancho, Cavani or Jovic, all is not lost because they can still buy Sarr until the domestic deadline on October 16 because Premier League clubs and EFL clubs can still do business after October 5 so they have another 11 days to maybe get a deal done. ""Manchester United's interest in Sarr can almost take a back seat, they can use it as a watching brief just now, unless someone else comes in for him, of course."" Former Manchester United assistant manager Steve McClaren has told Sky Sports News he thinks Dembele would only be a short-term option for his former club, until they are able to sign Sancho. McClaren encouraged United to meet Dortmund's asking price for Sancho, and also wants them to upgrade their defence, saying: ""They need a centre-forward, they need a centre-back and they need a left-back. Those are the priorities. ""But players like Sancho don't come around very often. He's a unique type of player to go into Manchester United. They've been searching all across the world. They're only £20m short - come on, get the deal done! It's for the future. ""United have done well so far with their scouting and who they have brought in. If they're still going for Sancho, then I think Dembele is for the short-term, a stopgap. ""But they need a centre-forward, and they need a centre-back. If they want to play with intensity and a high line, they need speed at the back."" Sky Sports' Jack Wilkinson: A bluff to bring Borussia Dortmund to the table, or a genuine alternative for the season until efforts to sign Jadon Sancho can be renewed next summer, on or off the pitch, Ousmane Dembele could certainly do a job for Manchester United. Dembele, a World Cup winner, undoubtedly comes with pedigree. Tasked with filling Neymar's boots, the 23-year-old was once the second-most expensive signing in football history when he moved from Dortmund to the Camp Nou in 2017. There was a promising start and glimpses of sheer brilliance, but with more time spent on the treatment table than on the field, it's fair to say Dembele's stint at Barcelona has fallen well short of expectation. In a little over three seasons, Dembele has featured in just 52 La Liga matches for Barcelona, scoring just 12 goals. In the same period, since the start of the 2017/18 season, Sancho has made 80 appearances and 30 goals for Dembele's former club Dortmund in the Bundesliga. The numbers are stacked in Sancho's favour and yet, as we enter the final week of the summer window, United are in talks with alternatives to their primary target. United may not be solely to blame for the Sancho impasse, but a move for an injury-prone player who has made just a single, 20-minute appearance throughout 2020 is symptomatic of the now frantic scramble to bring signings to Old Trafford, however much sense they make. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports News reporter Gary Cotterill told The Transfer Show: ""Borussia Dortmund are pointing to a little bit of déjà vu. ""At the moment, one of the biggest clubs in the world is trying to sign a young, extremely talented attacking player, a 20-year-old from Dortmund. Three years ago, one of the biggest clubs in the world were trying to sign a very talented, much sought-after attacking player from Dortmund. ""This time, it's Manchester United trying to sign Sancho and three years ago, it was Barcelona trying to sign Dembele. Barca came in with a bid of €100m - that's a familiar figure - and Dortmund immediately rejected it, saying it wasn't enough - that sounds familiar as well. ""Negotiations continued, Dembele dug in, he started to agitate and even missed training a couple of times but Dortmund dug in as well. In the end, Barcelona paid the money that Dortmund initially wanted and with add-ons and extras, anything up to €150m. ""So is that a sign of how determined Dortmund are when it comes to the negotiation process? We'll have to wait and see if it ends in the same way."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Football writer Andy Mitten has been questioning Manchester United's waning power in the transfer market and says they have lost the ability to do the ""dark arts of transfers"" with fans receiving ""mixed messages"" about the club's financial position. ""It's very frustrating for fans and they've seen just one player come in so far,"" Mitten told Sky Sports News. ""I don't think anyone has the same pulling power as Sir Alex Ferguson but to be fair to Ole, he's been putting calls in and I know he's spoken to several managers about players who he likes.""

Sky Sports News reported on March 31 Ten Hag was in pole position to land the job over Mauricio Pochettino, with sources close to the manager and Ajax revealing compensation is below £2m. The 52-year-old has signed a three-year deal with the option of a further 12 months. He told United's website: ""It is a great honour to be appointed manager of Manchester United and I am hugely excited by the challenge ahead. ""I know the history of this great club and the passion of the fans, and I am absolutely determined to develop a team capable of delivering the success they deserve. ""It will be difficult to leave Ajax after these incredible years, and I can assure our fans of my complete commitment and focus on bringing this season to a successful conclusion before I move to Manchester United."" Mitchell van der Gaag, Ten Hag's assistant at Ajax, is likely to join him at Old Trafford with advanced negotiations already under way. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Edwin van der Sar, Ajax's chief executive and a former United goalkeeper, said, ""we would have liked to have kept Erik for longer"", but added, ""he is going to make the step to one of the biggest clubs in the world"". VOTE: Who should stay or leave Man Utd this summer? Why the scale of Man Utd rebuild is frightening Man Utd exodus: 18 players who could leave this summer Ten Hag Q&A: Carra's verdict on incoming Man Utd boss Ten Hag told Ajax's website: ""I'm happy that it has been finalised and that it has been officially announced. That clarity is important."" John Murtough, United's football director, said: ""During the past four years at Ajax, Erik has proved himself to be one of the most exciting and successful coaches in Europe, renowned for his team's attractive, attacking football and commitment to youth. ""In our conversations with Erik leading up to this appointment, we were deeply impressed with his long-term vision for returning Manchester United to the level we want to be competing at, and his drive and determination to achieve that. ""We wish Erik the best of luck as he focuses on achieving a successful end to the season at Ajax and look forward to welcoming him to Manchester United this summer."" Ten Hag was understood to be the unanimous choice at United following a rigorous recruitment process that was led by Murtough and Darren Fletcher, the technical director. Richard Arnold, the executive vice-chairman, was also involved and the trio are understood to have agreed Ten Hag was the best candidate for the job. Mauricio Pochettino, the Paris Saint-Germain manager who previously coached Tottenham and Southampton, and Julen Lopetegui, the Sevilla boss, were also interviewed by United, but the club are believed to have felt the Dutchman was the one that most closely aligned with their plans for the future. Pochettino and Lopetegui are understood to have interviewed well, while Luis Enrique was also considered until it quickly became apparent he was committed to Spain ahead of this year's World Cup. United were looking for a number of attributes from their new manager, including proven success, a commitment to youth, the ability to improve players and the will to introduce an attractive style of play. Ten Hag is said to have set out his long-term vision to build a successful and exciting team during conversations with United, in which he is also said to have shown enthusiasm for the challenge he now faces at Old Trafford. Sky Sports News understands Ten Hag will tell United players he does not want any passengers at the club. His key message to them will be that he is the manager, there is a new regime and United are going to go back to playing like Manchester United. If there are any players who are not up for the challenge, they are welcome to leave, but everyone will start with a clean slate. He has not been given any specific targets, but he knows his job is to make United great again. Ten Hag also wants Steve McClaren to return to United and talks about making that happen are ongoing. The good relationship between United and Ajax helped smooth the process to appoint Ten Hag. It is believed potential negotiations with PSG, had United opted for Pochettino, would have proved more problematic. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ten Hag will be United's fifth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. The club have won only three trophies in the following nine years - the FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League - while they are currently in danger of missing out on qualification for the Champions League next season. Ten Hag is set to oversee a much-needed rebuild at United, with Rangnick - who is due to take up a consultancy role at Old Trafford this summer - saying after the 4-0 thrashing at rivals Liverpool on Tuesday that the side may need up to 10 new players. A number of first-team players, including Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard and Edinson Cavani, could be set to leave as part of the overhaul, with their contracts expiring at the end of the season. On Wednesday, the departures of Jim Lawlor, United's chief scout, and Marcel Bout, the head of global scouting, were announced. Ralf Rangnick said Manchester United need to sign as many as 10 new players after their 4-0 thrashing by Liverpool on Tuesday night, but which players could leave in their rebuild? Man Utd are currently sixth in the Premier League, three points off the top four but having played a game more than both Tottenham (fourth) and Arsenal (fifth). Will they squeeze into the top four? Here are their remaining fixtures... Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports News' senior reporter Melissa Reddy: ""Manchester United's interest in Erik ten Hag came as no surprise given his status as one of the most progressive coaches in Europe, and his long links to their managerial vacancy. ""The 52-year-old has had admirers at Old Trafford stretching back to 2018/19, when his Ajax side knocked out Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, before then stunning Juventus and only being denied a place in the final after Lucas Moura's last-minute goal for Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham. ""Ten Hag is a popular choice to take charge at Old Trafford and represents what is seen as a ""fresh, exciting future"", although there is an acceptance risk is involved as it is a sizeable leap for him. ""The last highly-successful Ajax coach to move to England's top flight - via Inter - was Frank de Boer, who lasted just 77 days at Crystal Palace. ""The expectations, global glare placed on United, and level of competition at the top end of the Premier League is like nothing he would have previously experienced."" Kaveh Solhekol, Sky Sports' chief reporter: ""The timing is not ideal if you are an Ajax supporter as they are in a race to win the Dutch title, but when Man Utd came calling, Erik ten Hag really could not turn down the club. ""It suits Man Utd to make this statement today for a variety of reasons: from a PR point of view, everybody connected with Man Utd wants some good news at the moment and also, it makes it clear what is happening at Man Utd over the next few months. There is clarity now - all the players who are thinking of leaving, or who Man Utd want to sign, know Ten Hag is going to be the new manager. ""He is also going to have the whole of the summer and pre-season with the players, so that is perfect preparation as far as he is concerned. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I also think it is very significant he is being called the manager - we know one of the things he has been asking for is to be in control of everything. He does not just want to be a head coach - he wants to have control over the transfer strategy and recruitment as well. ""I think Man Utd have made a lot of mistakes when it has come to appointing managers since Sir Alex Ferguson left, but this time round they think they have the right man and obviously he has a big, big job to do. ""But people need to retain a sense of perspective as well - I know the team are not playing as well or in the kind of way a Man Utd team should be playing. But let's not forget, less than 12 months ago, Man Utd finished second in the Premier League, they finished above Liverpool and over the past decade, six of the last 10 seasons they have finished above Liverpool. ""Man Utd are still a massive, massive club - one of the biggest clubs in the world. There are obviously still issues with the ownership structure, the way the club is run, but the big problem is they have not had the right manager in charge, and when they have had the right man, they have not given that manager enough time. ""This time round, when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer lost his job five months ago, we told you the replacement was going to be either Mauricio Pochettino or Erik ten Hag. I know a lot of people would have preferred Pochettino as he had Premier League experience with Southampton and Spurs, so it is a bit of a risk going for Ten Hag. ""Yes, he has done very well in Holland, but he has been managing the biggest club in Holland, he does not have any Premier League experience, but United have spoken to various candidates, they have interviewed Ten Hag, they interviewed Pochettino as well, and they have decided to go for Ten Hag. From United's point of view, it is great they have been able to get Ten Hag and announce it so quickly."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Gary Neville speaking on The Overlap in March: ""Ten Hag worked in Bayern Munich when Pep Guardiola was there. We know the impact that had. He's won a couple of titles and cups in Holland. His style of play is good. He's got more experience than I think most people think at the age of 52. ""It's a massive jump but he's got a good coaching pedigree. He's not scarred and that's a good thing - he comes in fresh. I did a poll the other week and I was absolutely stunned - 220,000 people voted and 82 per cent were in favour of bringing him in over [Mauricio] Pochettino. ""I knew that he would be favourite because you can smell it on social media. I think Manchester United fans are demanding a fresh start and a fresh name. They want something that's completely different that they've not had before, and that's probably gone against Pochettino in some ways."" Sky Sports' Adam Bate: ""Erik ten Hag will go to Manchester United as an outsider tasked with implementing cultural change at one of the world's most famous clubs. But that is a job that he has done before. ""At Ajax, they mocked his accent. He was a Tukker - a man from the east of the country, a region known for a down-to-earth approach. There were those in sophisticated Amsterdam who did not believe the great Ajax had anything to learn from him. They were wrong. ""Two domestic doubles and one kick away from a Champions League final later and there is an acceptance Ten Hag has brought some of the best football that Ajax have seen in years. His methods have delivered success, his manner has won over the doubters."" Ten Hag's coaching journey from Twente to Ajax via Go Ahead Eagles explained in-depth by those who were there from the start... Erik ten Hag must waste no timing in tackling the pressing issues at Manchester United. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick - who is due to take up a consultancy role at Old Trafford this summer - believes the team could require 10 new players as part of a huge rebuild. With United having finally confirmed the appointment of their new manager, Sky Sports takes a look at some of the key problem areas he must rectify...

Clubs have between two and five games left to seal their fate but 19 out of 20 clubs are still challenging for the title, qualification for the Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League, or to avoid the drop. Data guru Ben Mayhew has calculated each club's range of possible final league positions and found only Norwich have nothing to play for besides pride during the remainder of this season. Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United are all in the hunt to join title-tussling Manchester City and Liverpool in the top four - with Spurs and United potentially slipping as low as eighth to miss out on Europe next season altogether. With seventh spot being the lowest position to potentially offer a European berth, if permutations play out across competitions, it means all teams from fifth to 13th-placed Aston Villa retain the potential to qualify for Europe. Norwich were relegated on Saturday after a 2-0 defeat to Villa and results conspired against them elsewhere, but, theoretically, every single team sitting above the Canaries up to ninth-placed Brighton could finish in the drop zone. Watford have been widely written off in the survival race but the Hornets could still finish in 16th, while the attention for that final relegation spot centres on Everton, Leeds and Burnley - but all three could still secure a top-half finish. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Premier League fixtures Mayhew has also simulated every possible result from the remaining games and calculated the probabilities of each club's possible final positions. The results suggest Manchester City have a 69-per-cent chance of retaining their Premier League crown, while Liverpool have almost the same chance of finishing as runners-up. Chelsea are nailed down for third spot at 93 per cent, with Arsenal pipping Tottenham to the final Champions League berth at 74 per cent - while Manchester United have a whopping 94-per-cent-chance of finishing in their current sixth spot. Each club’s attacking and defensive strength have been rated using an expected goals model, which measures the quality of chances they create and allow.  These ratings were then used to simulate the rest of the season 10,000 times to measure the probability of each club finishing in each league position. Further down the table - between Brighton and Southampton - things become far less predictable, with fairly even spreads between ninth and 15th. The probabilities consign Watford to the Championship but the pressure ramps up for the final drop spot, with Leeds favourites to finish in 18th (46 per cent), followed by Everton (31 per cent) and Burnley (23 per cent).

Runaway leaders Fulham secured promotion to the Premier League at the first time of asking after a 3-0 win over Preston on April 19 and then lifted the title after a crushing 7-0 win over play-off chasing Luton on May 2. They were then joined by Bournemouth on May 3, after Scott Parker's side scored a late goal to sink Nottingham Forest and make their six-point cushion inside the top two unassailable with one game to spare.

In a press conference by the Austrian FA, Rangnick was appointed the new national team manager until 2024, with a clause inserted into the contract which states that the deal will be renewed for another two years if the country qualifies for Euro 2024. Rangnick was quoted by the Austrian FA website as saying: ""It's an honour for me to take on the role of team boss. I'm particularly excited about the prospect of contesting the European Championships in Germany with a young team hungry for success."" The 63-year-old replaced Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at United at the end of November, agreeing to take temporary charge of the team until the summer, before remaining in a consultancy role.

Ajax manager Erik ten Hag was recently announced as United's permanent boss for next season, although Rangnick will, as planned, still stay on as a consultant. That role will encompass six days a month for the next two years, meaning the German would be able to combine the work with his Austria duties.

Ronaldo moved level with Heung-min Son in joint second in the Premier League goalscoring charts with his 17th of the season on Thursday, earning United a 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Thursday evening with what was his fifth strike in his last three games for the club. The 37-year-old has scored eight of United's last nine goals, including match-winning hat-tricks against Tottenham and Norwich, in an emphatic response to criticism that came his way earlier in the season during a run of one goal in 10 games. Neville and Keane both highlighted Ronaldo's ill fit for Ten Hag's high-pressing style, but said the five-time Ballon D'Or winner's sheer quality meant he should have a chance to see out the second of his two-year contract at Old Trafford. Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, Neville said: ""He lifts the fans, he gets them on the edge of their seats, takes his chances, and it'll be really interesting to see what happens with Erik Ten Hag. ""We knows he plays with an aggressive press, he tries to win the ball high up the pitch, that isn't Cristiano's strong point and we know that. But he will want a goalscorer. He will want someone who can put the ball in the back of the net 20 or 25 times.

He's achieved everything and more in the game, his professionalism is beyond anything you could ever wish for, really. Ronaldo stunner rescues a point against Chelsea Premier League top goalscorers Get Sky Sports Rangnick to become Austria manager; will continue at Man Utd ""He still continues - his persistence, his determination to score goals is absolutely incredible. You can't speak highly enough of him, his goal tonight was wonderful and he doesn't really lose that belief in himself when the rest of the team is really lacking in confidence - his is still there. ""He's a sensation, an absolute sensation. I talked about the attitude of the players in the first half and I wasn't really talking about him, he's proven over a long period of time and what he's doing, the shape of his body and the recovery from the tragedy only last week to still perform, to get back on the bike and go when he could've easily said he was staying off for a few weeks. In a poor season for United he's been a bright light in some ways."" Keane highlighted Ronaldo's mastery of ""the hardest part of the game"" - scoring goals: he has scored 20 times in 12 consecutive league seasons, with the possibility to make that 13 in the final three matches of this campaign. And the former United captain said the bit-part defensive role some former strikers, including Eric Cantona and Ruud Van Nistelrooy, had played during his time at the club shows how Ten Hag could build a pressing team around Ronaldo during his first season at the helm. Keane told Sky Sports: ""I know people are quick to criticise what [Ronaldo] doesn't do, in terms of his pressing, but he was never great at that anyway. He's the greatest at the hardest part of the game - putting the ball in the back of the net. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""That was his only chance tonight. Look at the chances Chelsea were creating; imagine if he'd been in the Chelsea team - he'd probably get 50 goals. ""Ten Hag will be having a sleepless night watching the team, but if you've got a player in the group who can score that amount of goals, they have to be involved. He'll want to play week-in, week-out, the new manager will come in and will be looking for another striker but Ronaldo's not hanging around unless he's playing. ""That's his biggest challenge, working with these personalities. As brilliant as they are, he has to get a team who can compete. And if that's winning the ball back high and pressing, Ronaldo is not good at that. But I still think you can have him in your team and have other players who can do that. ""Cantona, Van Nistelrooy wouldn't be great at chasing the ball back for you, but we had enough lads in the team who could win it. People say you need all your players to press, but you can get away with it with one player, and as long as they're producing the goods you'll forgive them."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking after Ronaldo's latest point-winning goal involvement, interim manager Ralf Rangnick said Manchester United have become reliant on the Portuguese forward, and will have to invest in that department when the transfer window opens. ""Yes, right now we very much rely on Cristiano,"" he said at the press conference following the Chelsea draw. ""He also showed a good performance when Chelsea were in possession, he helped out a lot in the second half defensively.

The 63-year-old is set to fail in his objective of leading the stuttering club to Champions League qualification but still hopes to leave a lasting legacy at Old Trafford. Rangnick will switch from United's interim boss to a consultancy role in the summer - a job that will run in tandem with his new position as manager of Austria's national team. The German has an impressive track record of developing teams, recently succeeding with RB Leipzig and sister club RB Salzburg, and believes transfers are key to providing incoming boss Erik ten Hag that platform to succeed. ""For me, the most important bit is recruitment now,"" Rangnick said when asked what he will be advising on. ""This is, for me, the most vital point, that we bring in the best possible players and speak about that, who could that be. ""It's not only identifying those players but meeting them, convincing them to join this club, even though we will not be playing in the Champions League. Get Sky Sports Premier League table Man Utd fixtures Transfer Centre LIVE! ""This is what I see as the most important bit. Again, also, with regard to top talented players for the academy, identifying those kind of players."" Asked if United can go back to buying players at the peak of their powers, Rangnick said: ""My personal opinion is that the club should try to find future top star players and develop them. ""Again, on the other hand, just tell me five players that might be some of those players that you spoke about."" When Haaland and Kylan Mbappe were reeled off, Rangnick said: ""Haaland is a young player. He's 21 or 22. This is one of those players I spoke about. ""But, on the other hand, he has developed in the last two years into one of probably the most expensive strikers in the world. ""But, yes, he could be, he would be one of those examples where I think the focus should be on to try and identify and find and then convince players who could be Manchester United players for the next couple of years."" Rangnick believes United's support, stadium and training facilities still make them an attractive proposition irrespective of Champions League qualification. But that view also comes with a dose of realism given rivals Manchester City and Liverpool are flying high, with the club targeting the ""full package"" of ""mentality, quality, physicality, pace, skills"" in new players. Rangnick says it is obvious that the team need additions given their struggles and departing players, with Monday's match against Brentford looking to be an Old Trafford farewell for out-of-contract Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic. ""I would like to (play them) but it's also about getting the best possible result and the best possible performance,"" he said. ""It's not about making any gifts to players. ""Juan Mata played the last 15 minutes, Nema almost the whole game, so it's not about saying farewell to the supporters. ""If that is possible I would do that or I would like to do that, but it's also about getting the best possible result."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Rangnick hopes to have Fred back for Monday's match and captain Harry Maguire may return, while Edinson Cavani - another out of contract in the summer - was due to return to training on Friday. But the 63-year-old says Jadon Sancho will be absent against Brentford and ""might be out for the rest of the season with his tonsillitis"". Asked if Sancho was having his tonsils out, Rangnick added: ""It could happen. ""He's definitely got an inflammation on his tonsils and has also had some high temperatures, so that's why he was not available (against Chelsea) and he will most certainly not be available for the next two games.

72,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11748/12187923/how-brentfords-transfer-strategy-has-been-altered-by-brexit,How Brentford's transfer strategy has been altered by Brexit,"Brentford have become renowned for spotting, signing and developing players from the lower divisions ofEurope. Their philosophy of bringing them in for modest fees and selling on for tens of millions, from the UK and the continent, as better players has helped establish them as promotion contenders to the Premier League. But under the new work permit rules brought in as a result of Brexit, several of their biggest success stories would not have been possible. Neal Maupay, for example, who was bought for £1.8m from Saint-Etienne and sold to Brighton for £20m, would not have reached the new 15-point threshold, and neither would Said Benrahma, who was signed for £1.5m is worth £25m in his current loan to West Ham. So what do the new rules mean for Brentford's recruitment strategy? Will they have to change tact? And does it put into jeopardy their long-term progress? The changes have impacted Brentford's strategy, and probably the most tangible is on the amount of talent they have to scout and choose targets from; it will be greatly reduced. They have a sizeable scouting network that has been covering most of Europe, including the lower reaches of France and Germany, but much of this work is now redundant. So the club are working on an automated system that will instantly flag whether a player would gain a work permit or not before he is watched, which will reduce the scouting pool from the thousands to the hundreds, and this is seen as a positive by recruitment staff. Despite a smaller list, the club feel there will still be enough talent on the continent for them, but expect to face more competition and may need to pay more than they have done before to get them. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines January transfer window 2021: All you need to know Premier League ins and outs On their side is that the club have grown in stature since the signings of Maupay and Benrahma in 2017 and 2018, and can attract players ready for the top level of the Championship immediately; which is what they need. They have also recouped significant funds from player sales to be able to afford them, notably Ollie Watkins to Aston Villa for £33m. This has allowed them to invest as much as £10m in Ivan Toney from Peterborough, for example; a player that really has hit the ground running. This is the kind of signing fans should expect to see more of. One shift the Bees will make is to focus even more on talent coming from the lower leagues in the UK than they have done already. Brentford would be keen to give homegrown players a clearer pathway to first-team football. They have found considerable success from here already too; Watkins to name one, Ethan Pinnock another. Toney looks set to follow. This is also what the B team was set up for in part, and the shift has already been indicated in recent signings at this level; none more so than Max Haygarth from Manchester United's U23s. One thing Brentford will not be doing is rushing to establish a presence in the newly-accessible South American market. A number of clubs, representation agencies and intermediaries in the UK have been rushing to build connections to bring talent in from this region, which is now on a par with Europe as far as the Home Office is concerned. The Bees do not have a strong network in South America, having carefully built theirs in Europe, and this is where their focus will remain for the foreseeable future. They believe their set-up is dynamic enough to be able to 'play it by ear' to an extent, and adapt to market changes when they occur. Brentford's project has always had the goal of winning promotion to the Premier League. And with the club now firmly among the contenders, planning is in motion to strengthen the squad to be able to stay there. The club are looking across all positions for players with the ability to come straight in and make an impact. They have put a strong squad together that has dealt fairly well with some key injuries this season, so any player coming in would have to improve them. The club are aware of interest from bigger clubs in several key players too; notably the left-back Rico Henry, central midfielder Josh Dasilva and goalkeeper David Raya. But they will not sell any of them in the current window in the hope they will be a Premier League club come the summer and they can keep them. But should they miss out again this season, these are also positions the club will need to find quality replacements for; players that will not need the season-or-so that the likes of Maupay and Benrahma had to adjust.

The consortium led by US businessman Todd Boehly is the preferred bidder to buy Chelsea, but the UK government will not allow the sale to go through unless it is completely certain Roman Abramovich will not receive any of the proceeds. Two months ago Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale and said he would not be asking for his loans to the club to be repaid and all the proceeds would go to a charitable foundation for ""all the victims of the war in Ukraine"". Abramovich was sanctioned by the government on March 10, preventing him from doing any business in the UK. But the sale of Chelsea is being conducted by the Raine Group, an investment bank appointed by Abramovich, and he will have the final say on who buys the club. The government is aware of attempts to restructure any potential deal in a way which could see Abramovich receive the £1.5billion he has loaned the club through its parent company Fordstam Limited. The government has to issue a special licence for Chelsea to be sold and it would not do so if any of the proceeds were going to Abramovich or towards paying back the loans he is owed by the club. Chelsea fixtures Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Chelsea's government licence to operate runs out on May 31 and they are facing the prospect of going out of business unless the club is sold or the licence is extended. The Premier League are meeting on June 8 to constitute the new season, by which time Chelsea would need to have a licence to be part of the next campaign. Chelsea and Abramovich have declined to comment. Analysis by Kaveh Solhekol, Sky Sports News Chief Reporter Last week some of the bidders were told Abramovich or a company linked to him actually wanted to be repaid the loans he'd made to Chelsea. What that would mean is Roman Abramovich was not writing off his loans of £1.5billion and, ultimately, that money could find its way back to Roman Abramovich. There's no way the UK government are going to stand for that, because Abramovich is sanctioned. So what is going to happen to the money? And who's going to have control of that money? Is it going to be the UK government or is it going to be Abramovich? It can't be Abramovich, because he is sanctioned. The UK government are not allowing him to do any business in the UK. So we could have a potential situation where we've got a standoff between Abramovich and the government. And all the while the clock is ticking. The clock is ticking because Chelsea's licence to operate runs out at the end of this month, May 31. There are two sides to this. If you see it from Abramovich's point of view, he is thinking: ""They want me to sell Chelsea for £2.5billion and I'm not going to get any of that money. I'm going to lose all that money. I'm going to lose the club as well and I'm going to lose the £1.5billion I've lent the club"". From the other point of view, the UK government are saying: ""Look at what is happening in Ukraine, look at what Russia is doing in Ukraine. Abramovich is somebody who is linked to the Russian government. He's linked to Vladimir Putin. That is why he's sanctioned. We cannot have him doing any business in the UK. We cannot have him making 1p in the UK"". And in the middle of all this is a stuck Chelsea Football Club. What happens to Chelsea if Abramovich refuses to sell? And of course he could do that. He's got other business interests. He's got a house in Kensington that's worth £150m. He's not selling that at the moment and giving the proceeds away to charity. He's sitting tight. But the only problem is, if he sits tight and refuses to sell Chelsea then Chelsea will go out of business. Chelsea will not exist anymore and, of course, he's always maintained Chelsea are very, very close to his heart and he does not want that to happen. But if that was to happen, who would Chelsea supporters blame? Would they blame Abramovich or would they blame the UK government? So the clock is ticking not just for Abramovich, but also for the UK government because they can't have a situation on their hands when at the end of this month Chelsea's licence to operate expires and potentially one of the biggest clubs in the world could go out of business. Chelsea bidders were told last week they would be allowed to borrow money to finance their offers for the club. A source close to the sale process says the advice on debt was changed at the same time as the bidders were asked to increase their offers by £500m. The bidders are believed to have been told there would be an element of flexibility when it came to debt. The Glazer family bought Manchester United in 2005 in a leveraged buyout which has so far cost the club more than £1billion in interest and repayments. The consortium led by Todd Boehly is the preferred bidder to take over Chelsea and they have until the end of this week to finalise the terms of an agreement to buy the club. The bid is already being scrutinised by the Premier League to see if it passes their owners and directors test. Like the other bids, they have presented their extensive plans for the club to the Raine Group and they have given guarantees they will not sell the club for at least a decade. They have also given assurances they will invest at least £1billion in the club and infrastructure, including redeveloping Stamford Bridge. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The Sir Martin Broughton and Steve Pagliuca bids are still very much in play, with both consortiums still interested in buying the club. They are on standby to re-enter the process if the Boehly bid is unsuccessful. Both believe they have made very compelling bids for the club and both believe the club will thrive and flourish in their hands. It emerged last week that Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Britain's richest man, had tabled a last-minute £4.25billion bid to buy the west London club. But, the consortium of LA Dodgers part-owner Boehly was still named as the preferred bidder. Ratcliffe has not engaged in the process set out by the Raine Group, making it difficult for his bid to be considered. Irrespective of that, his bid remains on the table and Ratcliffe is still interested in buying Chelsea. Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

While the three-goal cushion may look comfortable, this was a test of Liverpool's nerve and powers of recovery as an awful first half by their standards saw their first-leg advantage wiped out by debut goals in the competition from Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin. But the half-time introduction of £37.5m January signing Luis Diaz, who has reinvigorated 2022 for Klopp's side, changed the game - aided by a poor goalkeeping performance from the hosts' Geronimo Rulli. Both Fabinho and Diaz's goals went through Rulli's legs, while the goalkeeper was beaten to the ball by Sadio Mane when he came charging out to leave the Senegalese forward with an unguarded net to seal the win on the night. ""It feels like the first in 20 (years),"" Klopp, who led Borussia Dortmund to the final of the competition in 2013 and Liverpool in 2018 and 2019, told BT Sport. ""It's outstanding, because we obviously made it a little tricky for ourselves, but we knew these kind of things could happen."" Liverpool head to the final in Paris to face either Real Madrid or Manchester City, who play their second leg in Madrid on Wednesday with City holding a slender 4-3 lead on aggregate. Klopp's side were shocked by Villarreal's aggressive man-marking in the first half which took them out of their own pressing game, and the coach conceded that he struggled to find highlights from the opening 45 minutes to show his players. Villarreal 2-3 Liverpool (2-5 agg) - Match report How the teams lined up Match stats Get Sky Sports ""We knew what was wrong because it was obvious, but we didn't have a situation to show them where we got it right,"" Klopp explained. ""I said (to my staff) 'find one where we do it well and we can show it', and we come in and they said 'no, we don't have it'."" The introduction of Colombian winger Diaz at the break seemed to liven up Liverpool's attack. ""Obviously Luis, what a player he is, but it's not about who came on, it was about how we started to play,"" Klopp explained. The 54-year-old coach said he had no preference for who his team would face in the final on May 28, saying ""whoever it will be, it will be massive"". Mohamed Salah admitted he would rather face Real Madrid than Manchester City in Paris in order to take revenge for Liverpool's 3-1 loss to the Spanish giants in the 2018 final in Kiev. Salah left the field in tears when he was forced off with a shoulder injury in the first half of that game and said he would relish the opportunity to face Madrid again. ""I want to play Madrid, I have to be honest,"" Salah told BT Sport. ""City is a really tough team. We played against them a few times this season. ""But I think, if you ask me personally, I prefer Madrid, because we lost in the final [to them], so I want to play against them and hopefully we will win it."" Salah, who provided the assist for Fabinho's crucial goal early in the second half against Villarreal, felt Liverpool's comeback in Spain underlined their strong mentality. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""It was tough in the first half but then we went to the dressing room. The gaffer talked and we talked to each other as well. ""That shows character and personality in the dressing room. It shows that we are a top team. That's why we can strike back after losing 2-0 in the first half. I think it makes the win more exciting."" Asked if he is motivated by the possibility of winning the Quadruple, he added: ""For sure. Maybe not at the beginning of the season because I always focus on the Premier League and the Champions League but now we are close for everything, so why not?"" Liverpool's hectic schedule continues as they host Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday at 7.45pm knowing they cannot afford to slip up if they are to catch Manchester City.

76,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/19531/12605017/cl-hits-and-misses-diaz-is-liverpools-game-changer,Luis Diaz is Liverpool's game-changer as Geronimo Rulli costs Villarreal - Champions League hits and misses,"Liverpool's players walked off the pitch in stunned silence as the home crowd roared with delight. It was half-time at the Estadio de la Ceramica and Villarreal had hauled themselves level on aggregate. Jurgen Klopp' side looked in serious trouble but fortunately for them, that was as bad as it got. By the end, a night which threatened disaster had turned into one of celebration. A third Champions League final in five years beckons and it owes a lot to Luis Diaz. The Colombian, outstanding since his arrival from Porto in January, changed the game after replacing Diogo Jota at the interval, scoring Liverpool's second goal when he headed home Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross and causing near-constant panic in Villarreal's previously untroubled defence. Within 15 minutes of his introduction, he had touched the ball more times than Jota did in the whole of the first half and every one of those touches seemed to strike fear into the yellow-shirted defenders unfortunate enough to find themselves in his vicinity. Juan Foyth, in particular, will be eager to forget his evening up against Diaz, whose explosive pace and sheer relentlessness gave the former Tottenham right-back no end of difficulties. Villarreal 2-3 Liverpool (2-5 agg) - Match report Liverpool fixtures Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Diaz was a whirlwind of activity on Liverpool's left flank, completing four dribbles and attempting four shots - twice as many as any of his team-mates despite only playing one half. But in addition to the chaos factor which destabilised Villarreal so effectively, there was composure in how he used the ball, with all but two of his 20 attempted passes finding a red shirt. Afterwards, Virgil van Dijk lauded his impact as ""incredible"" and the centre-back was not the only one grateful for the 25-year-old's contribution. He was Liverpool's game-changer. Just don't expect him to start on the bench again in Paris.Nick Wright It is a good time to be a Liverpool fan, who can look forward to two more finals this season. Indeed, Jurgen Klopp has guided them into an eighth final during his time as manager and they are just six games away now from an historic quadruple. Liverpool came here to complete the job, show professionalism and to finish what they started a week ago in the face of a crackling atmosphere - but they showed signs of frailty in the opening 45 minutes. Experience would eventually tell, aided and abetted by a distinctly ordinary goalkeeping performance from the hosts' Geronimo Rulli. Liverpool had been in this position twice before under Klopp, progressing on both occasions before losing the 2018 final to Real Madrid and winning a sixth European Cup against Tottenham the following year. Only one team has ever overturned a two-goal deficit from a Champions League semi-final - Klopp's Liverpool against Barcelona that season. Their know-how, particularly in 2019, certainly helped here in spite of Unai Emery's own very proud knockout history in European competition. He was the PSG manager on the receiving end of Barcelona's infamous 'Remontada' in 2017 - and was described as the ""king of the cups"" by Klopp - but this proved a step too far even for him to mastermind his own turnaround for a team currently seventh in La Liga. Ending May with four trophies in the cabinet is becoming an increasing possibility for Liverpool. The Carabao Cup was secured in February, and they can also look forward to an FA Cup final in just under a fortnight's time; underlying all of that is another epic title race which is set to go right down to the wire with Manchester City only one point ahead with four matches. The relentless pursuit of a quadruple - and a seventh European Cup - rolls on.Ben Grounds It is a stat that says it all about Villarreal goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli. The Argentine has made the most errors leading to goals of any player in the Champions League this season with three. Two of those came in the second leg defeat to Liverpool as he weakly let Fabinho's shot through his legs despite it being hit straight at him. A top-class goalkeeper would have definitely stopped the Brazilian's shot and kept Liverpool scoreless at the time. He could do little about Luis Diaz's goal that drew Liverpool level, as his powerful downward header went through his legs. But Rulli was entirely at fault once again for the third and final goal as he madly rushed out to clear the ball, but was beaten by Mane, who then rounded Juan Foyth to tap into an empty net for a simple finish. The 29-year-old was always going to be a major weak link following the first leg. He was incredibly shaky at Anfield as he constantly punched the ball and inspired the Liverpool attack more than his defence. Indeed, he was at fault for Liverpool's opener at Anfield as Jordan Henderson's deflected cross somehow looped over him following some poor footwork as he misjudged the flight of the ball. Over the two legs in this semi-final, Rulli cost his side three goals and things may have been tighter for Liverpool had Villarreal had a better goalkeeper. In fact, Rulli became the first goalkeeper to make two errors in the same knockout Champions League game since Liverpool's Loris Karius. Villarreal boss Unai Emery could certainly learn from how Jurgen Klopp moved on from Karius after that 2018 Champions League final defeat to sign Alisson and fix their goalkeeping issue.Declan Olley Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

Liverpool have faced the most gruelling schedule this season, playing 52 games in all competitions to City's 49, having won the Carabao Cup in February after City's early exit. Should Klopp's side overcome Villarreal to reach the Champions League final - and with an FA Cup final on the horizon next month - their overall number of games played this season will stretch to 63, a total only surpassed by five sides in Premier League history. On paper, there is no question that City have an easier run-in than Liverpool, something that their fans will surely be hoping gives them a crucial advantage as the hunt for the Premier League enters its final stages. Pep Guardiola's side only have three fixtures against sides currently in the top half of the table (Wolves, Brighton and West Ham) and none of them are against sides currently in the top six. The game at Molineux is arguably the toughest City will face during their run-in, for two reasons. The game does not yet have a date having been postponed due to City's participation in the FA Cup semi-finals, making it a harder task to prepare for, while City have only won once in three visits to Wolves since they returned to the top flight under Nuno Espirito Santo in 2018. City's trip to Brighton on Wednesday looks like a potential banana skin after the Seagulls' recent wins over Arsenal and Tottenham, but the champions have a strong record at the Amex Stadium, winning four of their last five visits and scoring 17 goals. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Download the Sky Sports app Premier League table Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It's a similar story with the West Ham game, which is live on Sky Sports - City have won four of their last five games in east London by an aggregate score of 18-2. If the Hammers reach the Europa League final next month, that game will fall just three days before City's visit to the London Stadium and will surely take priority over any Premier League fixture, given David Moyes' side are six points adrift of the top four. Guardiola's side will expect to see off Watford, Leeds and Newcastle - the latter two of those games are also live on Sky Sports - but the final-day fixture at home to Aston Villa presents an intriguing prospect. If the title is still on the line, could former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard - who was famously never able to bring the Premier League title to Anfield as a player - get a result at the Etihad and hand his former side the trophy? While City's run-in may lack headline fixtures, Liverpool's is stacked with them. Matches don't come much bigger than Liverpool against Manchester United, and Jurgen Klopp's side must negotiate that task on Tuesday, live on Sky Sports. However, a visit from their struggling north-west rivals does not spark the fear it once did, particularly given Liverpool have not lost at home to United in over six years. They will also know that three points over Ralf Rangnick's outfit will move them back to the top of the Premier League table, given City's next match is 24 hours later. Liverpool then face another huge game next Sunday when Merseyside rivals Everton travel to Anfield, live on Sky Sports. While the Toffees' immediate priority is staying in the top flight, they would love nothing more than to derail the Reds' title bid, and they did win 2-0 at Anfield last season. A trip to St James' Park to take on a Newcastle side that are much improved under Eddie Howe, follows before hosting Tottenham, who are likely to still be desperate for points in their quest to finish in the top four. Antonio Conte's team drew 2-2 with Liverpool in December, while Klopp has only beaten the Italian once in his managerial career. A reunion with Gerrard is then on the agenda when Liverpool take on Aston Villa and Southampton - live on Sky Sports - in successive away games before they end their season at home to Wolves. Klopp complained about Liverpool's schedule in the build-up to their win over City on Saturday, and he is unlikely to be happy about the scheduling of their Champions League fixtures in comparison to their title rivals. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The first leg of Liverpool's semi-final against Villarreal on Wednesday April 27 is sandwiched between their Sunday evening game against Everton and their trip to Newcastle on the following Saturday that kicks off at 12.30pm. City's first leg against Real Madrid is on Tuesday April 26 and takes place between a Saturday lunchtime game at home to Watford and their trip to Leeds in the evening of the following Saturday. The scheduling means City will have more than 24 extra hours to prepare for their game against Leeds than Liverpool will for theirs against Newcastle - a situation that prompted the Reds to ask the Premier League to move their trip to St James' Park. City will also get an extra day to prepare for their second game against Real, while both they and Liverpool will have three days between their Champions League second legs and their next Premier League fixture.

A breathtaking game, packed with chances and moments of individual brilliance was a treat for those watching but leaves City, who had the better of the game, with the slenderest of leads to defend at the Santiago Bernabeu next Wednesday. One of the key moments came as City's Aymeric Laporte was penalised when the ball struck his arm in the area and Benzema converted the penalty with a cheeky 'Panenka' chip down the middle to make the score 4-3 eight minutes from the end. It was a remarkable piece of skill, one that took nerves of steel considering Benzema had missed two penalties in Real Madrid's last game with Osasuna. After his two goals in Manchester, Benzema has now netted a staggering 41 goals in his 41 appearances this season. Benzema said: ""I always have it in my head that if you don't take a penalty, you will never miss a penalty. That's mental confidence and that's all. I have a lot of confidence in myself... so I do it and it turns out well."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player His boss Carlo Ancelotti said: ""I think he changed because the last two penalties were not good. He tried in training, I didn't know how he would shoot. He chose this [Panenka] and he did really well, showing strong personality and character. It's not easy in the semi-final of the Champions League to shoot a penalty like this."" City boss Pep Guardiola knows his team just need to avoid defeat in Spain to reach a second consecutive Champions League final but he won't be changing his attacking ethos.

We did many good things. Unfortunately we conceded goals and we could not score more. ""We played a fantastic game against an incredible team. The moments where they rise and come back into the game in the first half I think we gave them as our build-up was so nervous. Normally we are so safe and so good. Also they press really good and strong. All around the world and for Manchester City, we are so proud. But it is about reaching the final and sometimes football happens. We go to Madrid to try to win the game. ""We went out of the Champions League to Tottenham when Llorente with the hand. Today it is a hand for Laporte. It happens. All we can do is perform as we perform. The quality of Real Madrid is such they can punish you. ""What we have done with the ball and without the ball, creating chances and chances and chances I can't ask anything else. I say to the players to rest. Leeds now is the most important thing and we go to Madrid to win. Both teams want to attack and have the quality to play. Football is a fantastic spectacle. Congratulations to Carlo and his team as they are so good. At the same time, we saw ourselves that we can be there."" Madrid have already dug deep to edge past Paris St Germain and Chelsea to reach the semi-finals, and the Bernabeu is primed for another special night next week. Ancelotti's side had looked in danger of being blown away at times on Tuesday but somehow escaped trailing by one goal. Ancelotti told BT Sport: ""As a supporter of football it was a fantastic game. As manager of Real Madrid, I think I have to take into consideration we scored three goals and that was really important, but we didn't defend so well. ""We conceded two goals so early in the game and then we were able to react really well. We kept the game open until the end and of course now we have a great dream to play the second game in the Bernabeu and have the chance to go to the final. ""The first 20 minutes were really difficult but after that, slowly we were able to come back into the game and keep qualification open. ""We are going to play against a really strong team. They showed fantastic quality today but we competed and we have to compete more in our stadium."" Manchester City continue their quest for the Premier League title with a trip to Leeds on Saturday evening at 5.30pm, live on Sky Sports. City hold a one-point lead over Liverpool, who visit Newcastle on Saturday lunchtime. Real Madrid can win the La Liga title on Saturday with a victory at home against Espanyol.

79,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12579011/liverpool-further-in-quadruple-bid-than-any-english-club-in-history,Liverpool's Quadruple quest: How do Jurgen Klopp's side fare in historic bid?,"Liverpool moved a step closer to a historic Quadruple after beating Villarreal to reach the Champions League final - with the Reds' bid having now gone further into a season than any other English side before them. Jurgen Klopp's team headed to Spain leading 2-0 and, despite an early scare as Villarreal levelled the tie with two first-half goals, Liverpool fought back to win 3-2 on the night and 5-2 on aggregate to book their place in the Paris final on May 28th against either Man City or Real Madrid. Liverpool have surpassed the Chelsea side of 2006/07, whose own Quadruple challenge lasted all the way until May 1 of that campaign before losing to Liverpool in the Champions League semi-finals. The next leg of the Quadruple will come against Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley on May 14, a repeat of this season's League Cup final, which the Reds won on penalties in February. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, in the race for the Premier League, Liverpool are still just a point behind City as we enter the final four games of the season after an impressive unbeaten run in the league saw the champions' seemingly unsurmountable 14-point lead on January 15 evaporate. In total, Liverpool will face a gruelling seven-match schedule in May now they have made it through to the final of the European Cup at the Stade de France. So, how have other English teams got on when faced with such a daunting challenge, while surely the trophy-laden Liverpool sides of the 80s must have gone close to achieving the feat? And what about some of the great European giants of years gone by? Liverpool fixtures Premier League table As is surely common knowledge by now, no English team has ever won the Quadruple. Prior to this season, the closest any top-flight side had ever got to winning all four major trophies in a single campaign was Chelsea back in 2006/07. Heading into May of that season, Jose Mourinho's back-to-back Premier League champions had already landed the League Cup after beating Arsenal 2-1 at the Millennium Stadium, while they had an FA Cup final date to look forward to with Manchester United, who they were also going toe to toe with in the league. However, the Blues' challenge ended when they lost on penalties to Liverpool at Anfield in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final, while they would also go on to lose their title to United. Manchester United also came close to making history in 2008/09, only to slip up in the semi-finals of the FA Cup when losing 4-2 on penalties to Everton, although they did then get beaten 2-0 by Barcelona in that season's Champions League final in Rome. And, of course, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side have had numerous Quadruple bids as well since the Catalan arrived at the Etihad, the closest being in 2018/19 and last season. However, the former challenge was ended by Tottenham in the Champions League last eight and the latter after a defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals. Liverpool's current quest, though, will last at least until May 11 - Man City could win the league this day if Klopp's side lost to Tottenham and Aston Villa and City beat Newcastle and Wolves - meaning their Quadruple campaign will have lasted longer than any other English team's in history. And before you ask, Manchester United's famous Treble-winning season of 1998/99 actually included a League Cup quarter-final loss at Spurs in the December of that campaign. You would have thought Liverpool have come close before, but actually they have not, despite winning the League Cup four years in a row from 1981. It was the FA Cup that ultimately proved to be Liverpool's Achilles' heel in each of those four campaigns, with the Reds never managing to make it past the fifth round, meaning the closest they came was in 1982/83, only for a shock 2-1 home defeat to second division Brighton to end their Quadruple dreams in February. And it was Brighton again in the cup who scuppered the Reds' chances of winning all four trophies in their Treble-winning campaign the following season. Oddly enough, despite Klopp's 'Mentality Monsters' barely losing a game between 2018 and 2020, they never actually came close to winning the Quadruple. In fact, the nearest they came to achieving the feat was in their title-winning campaign of 2019/20, only for a youth side - selected because of a fixture clash with the Club World Cup - to lose 5-0 at Aston Villa in the League Cup quarter-finals to put an end that dream. In the first season in England when four trophies were up for grabs in 1960/61, it was Burnley who came closest before losing to Hamburg in the last eight of the European Cup in March 1961. However, Celtic did manage to accomplish the seemingly impossible in 1966-67 when Jock Stein's 'Lisbon Lions' won it all - the Scottish First Division, League Cup and Scottish Cup, followed by the first European Cup won by a British team after victory over Inter Milan. Well, the first thing to point out here is that up until the 2019-20 season, France, as in England, was the only other country in Europe's top-five major leagues to have an extra cup competition in the form of the League Cup, or Coupe de la Ligue. So that explains why European giants like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus have all never previously won the Quadruple. Paris Saint-Germain did, though, recently come within a whisker of pulling it off under Thomas Tuchel, only to fall agonisingly at the final hurdle. The big-spending Parisians were awarded that season's Ligue 1 title in April based on a points-per-game ratio after the campaign was prematurely curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when the season did eventually resume, PSG beat St Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final on July 24, before edging out Lyon 6-5 on penalties to claim the Coupe de la Ligue the following weekend. Then, when the Champions League also returned in August, Tuchel's team made it all the way to the final for the first time in the club's history, before unluckily losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. All of which shows just what a mountain Klopp and Co still face in order to make history this season...

80,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12604635/unfeasible-champions-league-plans-worry-premier-league-clubs,Premier League clubs concerned over 'unfeasible' Champions League reform and fixture congestion,"Premier League clubs have major concerns that plans to expand the Champions League will lead to ""unfeasible"" fixture congestion, and the potential for European matches to be staged on the same day as top-flight domestic games. Up until now, there has been an agreement with UEFA that there should be no clash between Champions League matches and Premier League games, with the weekend protected for domestic fixtures. But Sky Sports News has been told there are widespread concerns that UEFA's plans will be unworkable, and may lead to European and domestic games going head to head - especially if proposals are pushed through for 10 Champions League group matches per team from 2024 instead of the six matches currently played. UEFA has already committed to expanding the Champions League from 32 teams to 36 from 2024. That was voted through without fanfare at their executive committee meeting last month. We understand the Premier League is currently lobbying UEFA for only two extra matches per team in the group stages instead of the proposed four. That would take the total number of games in the group stages to eight per team. Under the current system, there are 125 Champions League games in total per season. If the tournament is expanded to include eight group games per team, that would mean 64 more matches - 189 in total (a 50 per cent increase), while 10 group games would lead to 100 more games, and a total of 225 Champions League matches throughout Europe, over the course of the tournament - a 80 per cent increase. Some officials have told Sky Sports News that such a sizeable expansion could well lead to a drop in UEFA revenue, because broadcasters across Europe might be put off from bidding for the rights to host the tournament. UEFA rules dictate that broadcasters who win the rights must show all matches, and not cherry-pick the best. Big Six all to qualify for CL? Why many PL clubs oppose new plans Latest Champions League news Champions League fixtures Get Sky Sports Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The new ""Swiss format"" which UEFA has proposed is expected to be ratified next month by its executive committee - though there are murmurings among European officials that UEFA may be forced to compromise. The plans include 36 clubs all in one ""conference"", whereby each team is drawn to play eight or ten different opponents, based on UEFA's ""coefficient"" - which means those teams who have done better in European competitions historically will be seeded higher, and play more of their group games against lesser opposition. The top 16 teams in the conference will then progress to the knockout stages, where the format will remain the same as now. There will no longer be home and away games against the same opposition until the knockout stages. Elsewhere in Europe, there are concerns that UEFA is pandering to the elite English clubs by offering them more and more places in the Champions League, at the expense of smaller footballing nations. Currently, the champions of 44 European countries have to pre-qualify for the Champions League before they have the chance of reaching the group stages.

Between 50-100 Chelsea supporters gathered ahead of Saturday's Premier League clash at home to Brentford to demonstrate against the Ricketts family's bid to buy Chelsea. The Chelsea Supporters' Trust said earlier on Saturday its membership ""neither supports nor has confidence in"" the potential new owners and that 77 per cent of members polled did not support the Ricketts' family bid. The family have committed in previous statements to being diverse and inclusive and doubled down on that pledge in a statement on Saturday. It said: ""Over the past fortnight, our bid team has met with several supporter groups to explain our vision for Chelsea Football Club. In those meetings, and by letter to all groups, we have shared a set of specific commitments we will make to fans, if our bid is successful. ""We believe these are far-reaching and certainly include an absolute commitment on the part of the Ricketts Family and the bid team to put diversity and inclusion at the heart of the club. ""We look forward to more meetings - including with the Chelsea Supporters' Trust - over the coming days and to making a public reiteration of our values and commitments."" Chelsea fixtures Latest Chelsea news Premier League table How to watch Premier League highlights The Chicago Cubs-owning Ricketts are among the final four bidders aiming to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich. Cubs chiefs and siblings Tom and Laura Ricketts front the family's candidacy to take over at the west London club. Father Joe Ricketts, who has no role at the Cubs or in the bid to buy Chelsea, used Islamophobic language in emails sent between 2009 and 2013 that were leaked in 2019. The 80-year-old later apologised. Chelsea fans have voiced concerns consistently on social media, and now the CST has added further weight to those worries. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""At present, it is clear that our membership neither supports nor has confidence in the Ricketts family's bid for the club,"" read a CST statement. ""This is reflective of wider concerns articulated by large, vocal sections of Chelsea's supporter base. ""The CST Board is guided by our membership, and thus we do not currently believe it is in the best interests of our members for the Ricketts family's bid to succeed. ""We await further public detail from the Ricketts family on concrete steps they will take to address the well-documented concerns of Chelsea supporters. ""Should the Ricketts publicly set out clear and detailed plans on how they will address support concerns, we may survey our members again in the next week."" Tom Ricketts has built bridges with the Muslim community in Chicago since his father's emails surfaced in 2019, and continues to apologise for his father's comments. The Ricketts have been adding advisory partners in fine-tuning their bid ahead of the April 11 deadline for improved offers, but their bid is understood to be funded entirely by cash. Hedge fund supremo Ken Griffin has added his significant personal financial clout behind the Ricketts' bid for Chelsea. Blues supporters continue to raise fears over the Ricketts' candidacy to buy the club, however, with those issues crystallised in the CST survey. ""Last week, the Chelsea Supporters' Trust stated that the Ricketts family must urgently and publicly address supporter concerns - especially with regard to inclusivity, given both past and recent statements by members of the family,"" read the CST statement. ""We also committed to surveying our members as to their confidence and support in the Ricketts family's bid for Chelsea FC. ""Yesterday we conducted a snap survey of our membership. We asked our membership whether, based on information in the public domain as of April 1, they had confidence that the Ricketts family would run an inclusive and successful club, and we asked whether they supported the Ricketts family's bid. ""Our members have given a clear message in this regard: 72 per cent of those who responded do not currently have confidence that the Ricketts family would run an inclusive and successful club, with five per cent of respondents believing they would. ""Similarly, 77 per cent of members who responded do not support the Ricketts family's bid for Chelsea FC and three per cent of respondents are in support. ""It is essential that the new owners of Chelsea FC have the confidence of the supporter base and demonstrate an understanding of the values that we stand for."" Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale on March 2, amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The 55-year-old was then sanctioned by the UK Government and later the EU, with Downing Street claiming to have proven his links to Vladimir Putin. Chelsea have been granted a special Government licence to continue operating, though under strict terms. Abramovich cannot profit from Chelsea's sale, but had already vowed to write off the club's £1.5billion debt.

What do Liverpool and Man City need to win?,"What do Manchester City and Liverpool need to win this season to cement their place in history - the Premier League or the Champions League? The Sky Sports pundits have their say... Just one point separates Premier League leaders City and second-placed Liverpool at the top of the table with seven games remaining, and both teams are still playing in Europe. City have dominated domestically, winning three of the last four league titles, but the Champions League has so far evaded them and Pep Guardiola admits they may have to conquer Europe to be fully respected. Liverpool, meanwhile, have won the Champions League and Premier League under Jurgen Klopp - but their struggles to keep up with City's consistency means they have just one league title in 32 years. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player City are still searching for their first Champions League trophy, while Klopp's side are one off equalling Manchester United's record of 20 English top-flight titles. Speaking after Sunday's pulsating 2-2 draw between the two sides at the Etihad, Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher, Micah Richards and Roy Keane had the debate... Carra: Can you call Man City a great team if they don't win the Champions League? Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Micah: Yeah I still think you can call them a great team. Pep has won three Premier Leagues. Liverpool are outstanding but they've only won the Premier League once and every year Man City are pushing them right to the limits. Liverpool are a great team in my opinion but how great depends on how long you do it for. Neville: I think they are both great teams because for Liverpool to win the Champions League and the league. To win two titles, to come back and win it again, would define that even more. Certainly for City to win the Champions League would define it even more. You're looking back in history at the teams who won the Champions League… you think of the great Liverpool teams who won the European Cup, you think of Manchester United teams who won the European Cup, they are viewed as teams that people always talk about. Pep has to win the Champions League here - he's a great manager, one of the greatest of all time and this is a great City team - but I do think he has to win that Champions League for him to finish the job here. The same with Klopp, probably has to go and win another Premier League title or another Champions League for them to get that sort of position in history. They've got it anyway but it further cements it. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Carra: It doesn't really matter in terms of the number of points they get (Liverpool could get 94 and not win the title), it shows how great they are: the numbers, the win percentage is probably better than maybe even Sir Alex Ferguson in terms of the games they won but it's how many trophies you've won and I go back to what I said six to 12 months ago, this Liverpool team is that good it should win more. That's the big thing over the next couple of years. They're going for another three trophies - they've only got their hands on one (this season). That's what they've got to do year in, year out. This team is too good, what it's done over the last three or four years under Jurgen Klopp to only have the trophies they have. Man City have got a number of trophies, so have Chelsea over the last 10 years. That's what Liverpool have to do, certainly over the next two years when Klopp's contract finishes. For me I'd always go with the Champions League. It's the biggest trophy you can win. I'd have said the opposite when Liverpool had gone so long without the title but now they've won the title - people may say differently because Liverpool didn't win the title in front of their own fans - but I always go, you've got the big five leagues in Europe and there will be five teams who win the league but only one wins the Champions League. I think that completely transforms your club. Keane: Not for me. I'd go with league title every day of the week. It's what you do week in, week out, in terms of what you stand for as a player. Of course the Champions League is brilliant, there's glamour behind it, great prestige but I think a league reflects a lot on what your team, your manager and your club stands for. Obviously it's very difficult, Champions League is fantastic, but I'd be picking the league title. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Neville: I think league title definitely for Liverpool this season. To go equal with Manchester United on league titles, obviously more Champions League/European Cups. If City win four in five… for Klopp to do what he's done is unbelievable to start with but to take two titles off this Manchester City team with the wage bill they've got, with the wage bill less, is out of this world what he's doing at Liverpool. He's already won a Champions League with Liverpool, I think two league titles would be something. Keane: They would want to win it in front of their supporters, the passion behind it, the long time, the players get a chance to enjoy it. They'd enjoy it even more. Carra to Neville: You're talking about Liverpool getting level with Man Utd but take that out of the equation, you'd rather win a Premier League title than a Champions League. Neville: I'd rather a Premier League title. Carra: So why do Man City need the Champions League then? Neville: Because they've won three Premier League titles in the last four years. For Pep to define his era here, if he can win a Champions League to go with that I think it defines his period here in terms of the all-round trophies, he'd have won all of them. If you win one Premier League title it's great but to win back to back or two defines you as a truly great team. Sky Sports' Gary Neville: ""We've looked at Manchester City's run in the Premier League and we think it's easier as historically we've looked at the Merseyside derby and the Manchester United game for Liverpool as tough. Those two teams are appalling at this moment in time, so they could be easier than any of the teams City have got. ""City face Watford, who are fighting for their lives, Leeds still have to win games and there's Newcastle away. When I look at the Liverpool fixtures, other than the Tottenham one, and I feel they can win them all. ""You may look on paper and think Liverpool have the tougher run-in, but actually it's not. I'd rather play Manchester United and Everton at home than play West Ham away. When you think of United, it's historical, but you can't bring that into it. ""I think Liverpool and Man City win every single game. I've said City would win it all along, and then maybe Liverpool came back into it a few weeks ago but coming off today, I think it'll just be City."" Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher: ""I think it's the away games which are tougher for City. You look at no matter who they're playing at home, Liverpool or Manchester City, they expect to win. Leeds away, West Ham away and Wolves away - we're only talking about a draw being fatal. ""City's second leg against Atletico in the Champions League is going to be very tough in that atmosphere whereas Liverpool are virtually in the next round. You know they're going to be playing either Bayern Munich or Villarreal. ""If City were to go out, and think that would give them a massive advantage in terms of winning the league.""

85,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11945/12588565/champions-league-reforms-like-european-super-league-via-back-door-warns-premier-league-network,"Champions League reforms like 'European Super League via back door', warns Premier League Network","Champions League reform proposals put forward by UEFA amount to a Super League via the back door, according to a Premier League fans' group. Europe's premier club competition is being revamped ahead of the 2024-25 season, with UEFA expected to finalise the format at its next executive committee meeting in Vienna on May 10. However, supporters have criticised a proposal to allow two teams to qualify for the expanded Champions League group stage based on historical European performance rather than domestic league placing. The Football Supporters' Association's Premier League Network says the proposals protect the big clubs and have echoes of the European Super League, which was launched almost a year ago and collapsed within 72 hours amid supporter protests. ""We are united in opposition to proposals to reform the Champions League that are a back door attempt at a return to the discredited idea of a European Super League,"" a Network statement read. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""Last year, it was our supporter groups that united to force the collapse of the European Super League. At the time, UEFA told us that fans were the heart of the game and promised fans' views would be centre stage in deciding what came next."" The UEFA proposal also includes an increase in group-stage matches from the current six to 10, plus a further two-leg play-off round to determine eight of the sides that reach the last 16 knockout stage. UEFA's new finance rules to replace FFP Champions League fixtures Get Sky Sports Find out more about Sky Sports ""It is with great dismay that we now face the prospect of changes to the Champions League that will mean many more group games being played and entry for some clubs being based on a historical five-year 'UEFA Club Co efficient',"" the Network's statement added. ""These proposals will only widen the gap between rich clubs and the rest, at the same time wrecking domestic league calendars, with the expectation that fans sacrifice yet more time and money attending meaningless group games. ""Fans do not want even more European games, especially drawn-out group stages of 10 games and an extra knockout round. ""It is irresponsible and out of touch to even consider doubling the number of home games that fans will have to attend before the last 16 knockout round begins. This will be compounded by the cost of living crisis that is hitting Europe."" The Network said they ""feared"" for the FA Cup and the League Cup under these plans to increase the number of European matches. The Network called on UEFA to reject any plans to allow qualification for the Champions League on anything other than domestic sporting merit, and to reject any increase in the number of matches. Throughout the consultation process, the position of the European Leagues group, which includes the Premier League, has been to accept an increase from six to eight matches but that the two 'extra' qualification places be awarded to domestic champions from medium-sized and smaller countries, rather than on co-efficient ranking. UEFA's executive committee initially approved reforms to the Champions League on April 19 last year, hours after the Super League had been launched. The approved format at that time included an increase in matches from six to 10 and two co-efficient places. The co-efficient proposal has been tweaked so that a team can only qualify if they finish directly outside the conventional Champions League qualification places. This was to address concerns raised by the leagues over the possibility of big clubs leapfrogging smaller rivals into the premier competition. However, it is understood the proposals would allow for teams with a strong co-efficient to qualify for the Champions League via winning the FA Cup, while teams with less pedigree winning the competition would miss out. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Network's statement added: ""Premier League fans do not want 10 group games involving a small cartel of rich clubs further distorting competitive balance. ""We want strong, competitive domestic leagues, an equal opportunity for all to qualify for UEFA competitions based on sporting merit, along with a fairer distribution of the game's wealth from the revenues those competitions earn. ""Last year we engaged in constructive discussions with UEFA president (Aleksander) Ceferin who made a commitment that fans would be listened to in this process. Our collective voice is unified and our position clear. ""We call on UEFA to demonstrate that it acts in the interests of the wider football community and its supporters, not just the interests of the few rich investors and state-owned clubs that, less than a year ago, tried to destroy the European football family.""

From world-class stars like Lucy Bronze and Vivianne Miedema, to competitive derby days, there are plenty of reasons to be excited... Back in March, Sky Sports announced a three-year deal with the FA to become the primary broadcaster of the WSL from September 2021. The deal will see Sky Sports show at least 35 games exclusively live per season and further strengthens the broadcaster's commitment to women's sport. The excitement has kicked up a gear with Friday's fixture announcement and there are plenty of reasons why you should watch this season... The Barclays FA Women's Super League has no shortage of famous names. Lucy Bronze returned to Manchester City last summer after a trophy-laden spell at Lyon. Pick an individual women's award and Bronze has probably been nominated for it, with the 29-year-old regarded as one of the best full-backs in the women's game. It is hard to overlook Arsenal forward Vivianne Miedema if we are considering some of the best. In four years at the club, she has scored 93 goals in 99 games across all competitions, while netting 18 goals in 22 WSL games last term, beaten to a third Golden Boot by Chelsea's Sam Kerr. In October 2020, Miedema became the first player to score 50 WSL goals, overtaking the all-time league record of 49 set by Nikita Parris. She is also the Netherlands' highest international goalscorer across both senior teams with 73 goals - far more than the men's record holder Robin van Persie (50) - and helped her country to a runners-up spot at the 2019 World Cup. WSL live on Sky Sports from 2021/22 season Latest Women's Super League fixtures Duggan: Everton Women can fulfil aim and qualify for CL Find out what's live on Sky Sports here That is before we even mention Pernille Harder - the most expensive women's footballer after her move to Chelsea in September - her club team-mates, Sam Kerr and Fran Kirby, and the well-known England Women contingent at City, including Steph Houghton, Georgia Stanway and Ellen White. The Barclays FA Women's Super League had an exciting influx of American talent in the league last summer, although many have now returned to the USA having signed short-term deals. But fear not, there are plenty of new - or mostly not so new - faces to enjoy this season. Two names that will be well known to WSL and England fans are Nikita Parris and Toni Duggan, having signed for Arsenal and Everton respectively. After a trophy-laden two years with Lyon, Parris became Arsenal's club-record signing at the start of July, having previously won five major trophies with City. Her former City team-mate, Duggan, spent the last four years playing for Barcelona and Atletico Madrid in Spain, but has returned to her roots at Everton, having begun her career at the club. Duggan believes Everton - who finished fifth in the WSL last season - can challenge Chelsea, Arsenal and City for the league title, telling Sky Sports News: ""We have not hid away from that, I think you have heard (Everton manager) Willie [Kirk] speak about it as well - that is the aim,"" Duggan said. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""We want to break down the teams like Chelsea, Arsenal, Man City. They have had many years building the team, and they have been really successful over the past few years. Everton are at that stage now to take the next step."" City are not ones to be outdone though, having signed recent Champions League-winning captain Vicky Losada. The midfielder has spent most of her career at Barcelona, although enjoyed two seasons with Arsenal. She won the Women's FA Cup and WSL Cup, before returning to Spain for another hugely successful spell, culminating in Barca's first Women's Champions League title in May 2021. City have also further strengthened up front, landing striker Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw from Bordeaux. Her two years in France were a huge success and the Jamaica international ended the 2020/21 season with 22 goals and seven assists, winning the Division 1 Feminine Golden Boot and also earning a place on the French Football Federation's Team of the Year. Although their history may not be as long, there are some exciting derbies in the Barclays FA Women's Super League that can match the men's fixtures for rivalry and memorable moments. The last two matches to break the WSL attendance record have been derby games. In September 2019, the WSL's inaugural Manchester derby was held at the Etihad Stadium with 31,213 spectators. That record was then broken two months later when Tottenham faced Arsenal in the first north London derby in the WSL and the hosts' first match at the impressive Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The game beat the previous record by a fair margin too, with 38,262 people attending. March's north London derby was also held at the stadium, although without fans in attendance. Both fixtures have enjoyed some entertaining recent encounters too. The first Manchester derby this season was a thrilling 2-2 draw as Man Utd came from 2-0 down to take a point, complete with some superb goals. City were the most recent winners in February, winning 3-0 at the Academy Stadium. While Arsenal have had the upper hand in most north London derbies so far, they were taken all the way to penalties by Tottenham in their WSL Cup meeting in November. Spurs twice came from a goal down to secure a 2-2 draw, before a dramatic shootout saw Alex Morgan miss the decisive spot-kick to hand Arsenal victory. Let's also not forget about the Second City derby. Both Aston Villa and Birmingham battled against relegation last term, but eventually survived at the expense of Bristol City. Their most recent match in April was a dramatic affair - Veatriki Sarri's 96th-minute equaliser secured a 1-1 draw for the Blues. Let's not downplay the role England Women have had in promoting the women's game. Their successes over the last five years have had a huge hand in the attention and investment that women's football has had, with many of the players plying their trade in the Barclays FA Women's Super League. The Lionesses' third-place finish at the 2015 World Cup - which until recently, was the highest any senior England team had finished at a major tournament since 1966 - thrust women's football into the spotlight and they have maintained that interest. Although having never managed before, Phil Neville's appointment in 2017 attracted attention - people wanted to see how he would fare in his first role. That meant more eyes on women's football and, again, they followed it up in superb fashion. Neville's first task was the 2018 SheBelieves Cup in which England finished second before going on to win the tournament the following year. He also led the Lionesses to a World Cup semi-final in 2019, before packing out Wembley in November later that year for a friendly against Germany, with the 77,768-strong crowd the highest attendance for a home international women's game in England. It is a testament to England's success that some of the most successful managers in the sport were linked with the job when Neville announced his intended departure, including Jill Ellis and Emma Hayes. Hege Riise has taken the reins on an interim basis after Neville left England early to join Inter Miami, and will also lead Team GB at this summer's Olympics. The Lionesses' first permanent non-British manager, Sarina Wiegman, will take over the role from September 2021. She is the reigning European Championship-winning coach with the Netherlands, leading the country to a runners-up spot at the 2019 World Cup, and is already targeting similar success with England. With the 2022 Women's Euros taking place in England, it's a huge chance for the Lionesses to impress on their home turf as a final at Wembley awaits. You only have to look at the numbers to see that the last two seasons have been huge for the Barclays FA Women's Super League and women's football across the board. More girls are seeing players like themselves on TV, going a long way to inspire and encourage the next generation. Harder told WFS Live last year: ""When I was young, there were not that many women's players for me to see on the platforms or see games on TV. Most of my idols were actually men's players. ""In the last five years, I feel like it's really been growing a lot and many games are now on television... So many young girls can watch us play and now we can be their idols instead of [Lionel] Messi and [Cristiano] Ronaldo."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In 2017, the FA launched the 'Gameplan for Growth' to try and double female participation in football. They have now reached that target, with 3.4m females now playing the sport, including a 54 per cent increase in affiliated women's and girls' teams. Football is the biggest women's team sport in England, according to the FA, and, as already mentioned, England Women have had a huge hand in that with televised WSL games each week surely a very close second. But it also takes volunteers, coaches and opportunity to help women's football grow even more as girls continue to break down the gender barriers in a male-dominated sport and realise they can be the next Harder, Miedema or Bronze. The Barclays FA Women's Super League turning professional in 2018 was a watershed moment after years of part-time contracts, working multiple jobs and a lack of investment. Women's football was getting the attention it had been crying out for to make it possible for women to also earn a living playing the game they love. There is still a long way to go on this front though. The Women's Championship remains a semi-professional league with many players holding down full-time jobs as well as full-time training and playing programmes - but there are improvements happening all the time. In these strange times we are living in, it is important to keep up the momentum and support from the last few years for a game that is only growing every season.

Pick an individual women's award and Bronze has probably been nominated for it, with the 29-year-old regarded as one of the best full-backs in the women's game. It is hard to overlook Arsenal forward Vivianne Miedema if we are considering some of the best. In three-and-a-half years at the club, she has scored 87 goals in 92 games across all competitions and has scored 14 goals in 16 WSL games this season. In October 2020, Miedema became the first player to score 50 WSL goals, overtaking the all-time league record of 49 set by Nikita Parris. She is also the Netherlands' highest international goalscorer across both senior teams with 71 goals - far more than the men's record holder Robin van Persie (50) - and helped her country to a runners-up spot at the 2019 World Cup. Latest Women's Super League table Latest Women's Super League fixtures Hayes: Sky Sports brings elevation WSL needs Find out what's live on Sky Sports here The Netherlands were beaten 2-0 by the USA in the final, with a number of the eventual winners currently playing in the WSL. Rose Lavelle and Sam Mewis are at Man City, Christen Press and Tobin Heath are playing for Manchester United. Alex Morgan also spent time at Tottenham before returning to the USA. That is before we even mention the likes of Pernille Harder - the most expensive women's footballer after her move to Chelsea in September - her club team-mates, Sam Kerr and Fran Kirby, and the well-known England Women contingent at Man City, including Steph Houghton, Georgia Stanway and Ellen White. The WSL has long been dominated by Chelsea, Arsenal and Man City - dubbed the 'big three' - sharing the title between them seven times over the last nine seasons. But there seems to be a shift happening at the top. Manchester United, in their second WSL season, were the league leaders earlier in the campaign. Casey Stoney's side have had a meteoric rise, having only reformed in 2018, and are currently third - three points ahead of Arsenal. Their American arrivals have boosted the quality already in the squad, with the likes of Lauren James and Ella Toone just two of the players also catching the eye. Everton also look like spoiling the party. Having been in and around the top teams this season, they now sit fifth and have recruited well. Everton have re-signed Izzy Christensen and Jill Scott, secured Claire Emslie on a permanent deal and landed talented striker Valerie Gauvin, who has scored five WSL goals this season. But it is more likely that either Chelsea or Man City will eventually win the title - Emma Hayes' Chelsea side are the current leaders, but only by two points and one ahead on goal difference. Should the table stay as it is, it would be a fourth successive WSL runners-up spot for Man City, having missed out on the title last season as the league was decided on points-per-game after its suspension due to Covid-19. Although their history may not be as long, there are some exciting derbies in the WSL that can match the men's fixtures for rivalry and memorable moments. The last two matches to break the WSL attendance record have been derby games. In September 2019, the WSL's inaugural Manchester derby was held at the Etihad Stadium with 31,213 spectators. That record was then broken two months later when Tottenham faced Arsenal in the first north London derby in the WSL and the hosts' first match at the impressive Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The game beat the previous record by a fair margin too, with 38,262 people attending. Saturday's north London derby in the WSL will again be held at Tottenham, although still without fans. Both fixtures have enjoyed some entertaining recent encounters too. The first Manchester derby this season was a thrilling 2-2 draw as Man Utd came from 2-0 down to take a point, complete with some superb goals. Man City were the most recent winners in February, winning 3-0 at the Academy Stadium. While Arsenal have had the upper hand in most north London derbies thus far, they were taken all the way to penalties by Tottenham in their WSL Cup meeting in November. Spurs twice came from a goal down to secure a 2-2 draw, before a dramatic shootout saw Morgan miss the decisive spot-kick to hand Arsenal victory. Let's also not forget about the Second City derby. Aston Villa were promoted from the Women's Championship last season while Birmingham narrowly avoided passing their rivals on the way down, finishing 11th on points-per-game. Their match in November was a tense affair won by the Blues thanks to Claudia Walker's second-half strike. Let's not downplay the role England Women have had in promoting the women's game. Their successes over the last five years have had a huge hand in the attention and investment that women's football has had, with many of the players plying their trade in the WSL. The Lionesses' third-place finish at the 2015 World Cup - still the highest any senior England team has finished at a major tournament since 1966 - thrust women's football into the spotlight and they have maintained that interest. Although having never managed before, Phil Neville's appointment in 2017 attracted attention - people wanted to see how he would fare in his first role. That meant more eyes on women's football and, again, they followed it up in superb fashion. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Neville's first task was the 2018 SheBelieves Cup in which England finished second before going on to win the tournament the following year. He also led the Lionesses to a World Cup semi-final in 2019, before packing out Wembley in November later that year for a friendly against Germany, with the 77,768-strong crowd the highest-ever attendance for a home international women's game in England. It is a testament to England's success that some of the most successful managers in the sport were linked with the job when Neville announced his intended departure, including Jill Ellis and Hayes. Hege Riise has taken the reins on an interim basis after Neville left England early to join Inter Miami, and will also lead Team GB at this summer's Olympics. The Lionesses' first permanent non-British manager, Sarina Wiegman, will take over the role from September 2021. She is the reigning European Championship-winning coach with the Netherlands, leading the country to a runners-up spot at the 2019 World Cup, and is already targeting similar success with England. You only have to look at the numbers to see that the last two seasons have been huge for the WSL and women's football across the board. More girls are seeing players like themselves on TV, going a long way to inspire and encourage the next generation. Harder told WFS Live last year: ""When I was young, there were not that many women's players for me to see on the platforms or see games on TV. Most of my idols were actually men's players. ""In the last five years, I feel like it's really been growing a lot and many games are now on television... So many young girls can watch us play and now we can be their idols instead of [Lionel] Messi and [Cristiano] Ronaldo."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In 2017, the FA launched the 'Gameplan for Growth' to try and double female participation in football. In May this year, they reached that target, with 3.4m females now playing the sport, including a 54 per cent increase in affiliated women's and girls' teams. Football is the biggest women's team sport in England, according to the FA, and, as already mentioned, England Women have had a huge hand in that with televised WSL games each week surely a very close second. But it also takes volunteers, coaches and opportunity to help women's football grow even more as girls continue to break down the gender barriers in a male-dominated sport and realise they can be the next Harder, Miedema or Bronze. The WSL turning professional in 2018 was a watershed moment after years of part-time contracts, working multiple jobs and a lack of investment. Women's football was getting the attention it had been crying out for to make it possible for women to also earn a living playing the game they love. While there is still a long way to go on this front. The Women's Championship remains a semi-professional league with many players holding down full-time jobs as well as full-time training and playing programmes - but there are improvements happening all the time. In these strange times we are living in, it is important to keep up the momentum and support from the last few years for a game that is only growing every season. From the start of the 2021/22 campaign, that will be right here, live on Sky Sports. Sky Sports has announced a three-year deal with the FA to become the primary broadcaster of the Barclays FA Women's Super League from September 2021, becoming one of Sky Sports flagship offerings. The deal will see Sky Sports show at least 35 games exclusively live per season and further strengthens the broadcaster's commitment to women's sport. Sky Sports will now begin a recruitment process for the best-in-class on- and off-screen production team as part of the plan to align WSL with the broadcaster's other big sporting leagues and events. The WSL will get the full Sky Sports treatment with lengthy build-ups and reaction to all live matches, plus daily news from the competition across Sky Sports News and Sky Sports' digital platforms.

We expect nothing but the best from you guys and look forward to seeing ourselves on your screens on a regular basis."" Manchester City and Lionesses captain Steph Houghton says the WSL players are desperate to experience the same spotlight, scrutiny and analysis that comes with marquee Premier League fixtures on Sky Sports.

The Barclays FA Women's Super League has no shortage of famous names. Lucy Bronze returned to Manchester City last summer after a trophy-laden spell at Lyon. Pick an individual women's award and Bronze has probably been nominated for it, with the 29-year-old regarded as one of the best full-backs in the women's game. It is hard to overlook Arsenal forward Vivianne Miedema if we are considering some of the best. In four years at the club, she has scored 93 goals in 99 games across all competitions, while netting 18 goals in 22 WSL games last term, beaten to a third Golden Boot by Chelsea's Sam Kerr. In October 2020, Miedema became the first player to score 50 WSL goals, overtaking the all-time league record of 49 set by Nikita Parris. She is also the Netherlands' highest international goalscorer across both senior teams with 73 goals - far more than the men's record holder Robin van Persie (50) - and helped her country to a runners-up spot at the 2019 World Cup. WSL live on Sky Sports from 2021/22 season Latest Women's Super League fixtures Duggan: Everton Women can fulfil aim and qualify for CL Find out what's live on Sky Sports here That is before we even mention Pernille Harder - the most expensive women's footballer after her move to Chelsea in September - her club team-mates, Sam Kerr and Fran Kirby, and the well-known England Women contingent at City, including Steph Houghton, Georgia Stanway and Ellen White. The Barclays FA Women's Super League had an exciting influx of American talent in the league last summer, although many have now returned to the USA having signed short-term deals. But fear not, there are plenty of new - or mostly not so new - faces to enjoy this season. Two names that will be well known to WSL and England fans are Nikita Parris and Toni Duggan, having signed for Arsenal and Everton respectively. After a trophy-laden two years with Lyon, Parris became Arsenal's club-record signing at the start of July, having previously won five major trophies with City. Her former City team-mate, Duggan, spent the last four years playing for Barcelona and Atletico Madrid in Spain, but has returned to her roots at Everton, having begun her career at the club. Duggan believes Everton - who finished fifth in the WSL last season - can challenge Chelsea, Arsenal and City for the league title, telling Sky Sports News: ""We have not hid away from that, I think you have heard (Everton manager) Willie [Kirk] speak about it as well - that is the aim,"" Duggan said. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""We want to break down the teams like Chelsea, Arsenal, Man City. They have had many years building the team, and they have been really successful over the past few years. Everton are at that stage now to take the next step."" City are not ones to be outdone though, having signed recent Champions League-winning captain Vicky Losada. The midfielder has spent most of her career at Barcelona, although enjoyed two seasons with Arsenal. She won the Women's FA Cup and WSL Cup, before returning to Spain for another hugely successful spell, culminating in Barca's first Women's Champions League title in May 2021. City have also further strengthened up front, landing striker Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw from Bordeaux. Her two years in France were a huge success and the Jamaica international ended the 2020/21 season with 22 goals and seven assists, winning the Division 1 Feminine Golden Boot and also earning a place on the French Football Federation's Team of the Year. Although their history may not be as long, there are some exciting derbies in the Barclays FA Women's Super League that can match the men's fixtures for rivalry and memorable moments. The last two matches to break the WSL attendance record have been derby games. In September 2019, the WSL's inaugural Manchester derby was held at the Etihad Stadium with 31,213 spectators. That record was then broken two months later when Tottenham faced Arsenal in the first north London derby in the WSL and the hosts' first match at the impressive Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The game beat the previous record by a fair margin too, with 38,262 people attending. March's north London derby was also held at the stadium, although without fans in attendance. Both fixtures have enjoyed some entertaining recent encounters too. The first Manchester derby this season was a thrilling 2-2 draw as Man Utd came from 2-0 down to take a point, complete with some superb goals. City were the most recent winners in February, winning 3-0 at the Academy Stadium. While Arsenal have had the upper hand in most north London derbies so far, they were taken all the way to penalties by Tottenham in their WSL Cup meeting in November. Spurs twice came from a goal down to secure a 2-2 draw, before a dramatic shootout saw Alex Morgan miss the decisive spot-kick to hand Arsenal victory. Let's also not forget about the Second City derby. Both Aston Villa and Birmingham battled against relegation last term, but eventually survived at the expense of Bristol City. Their most recent match in April was a dramatic affair - Veatriki Sarri's 96th-minute equaliser secured a 1-1 draw for the Blues. Let's not downplay the role England Women have had in promoting the women's game. Their successes over the last five years have had a huge hand in the attention and investment that women's football has had, with many of the players plying their trade in the Barclays FA Women's Super League.

It is a testament to England's success that some of the most successful managers in the sport were linked with the job when Neville announced his intended departure, including Jill Ellis and Emma Hayes. Hege Riise has taken the reins on an interim basis after Neville left England early to join Inter Miami, and will also lead Team GB at this summer's Olympics. The Lionesses' first permanent non-British manager, Sarina Wiegman, will take over the role from September 2021. She is the reigning European Championship-winning coach with the Netherlands, leading the country to a runners-up spot at the 2019 World Cup, and is already targeting similar success with England. With the 2022 Women's Euros taking place in England, it's a huge chance for the Lionesses to impress on their home turf as a final at Wembley awaits.

Johnstone - who's won three senior caps for England - is keen to get back into the Premier League, and has refused the offer of a new deal at the Hawthorns. A number of other clubs, including Southampton, are also thought to be interested. Steve Bruce admitted at the weekend that he expects Johnstone to leave at the end of the season, rather than stay and fight for promotion with Albion. Johnstone came through the Manchester United academy, and officials have kept a close eye on his progress since allowing him to leave the club four years ago. There could be a significant shake-up in the goalkeeping department at Old Trafford this summer, with Dean Henderson considering his options as he seeks more regular football. Last season, Henderson was vying with David de Gea for the United No 1 jersey, but this season he hasn't played in a single Premier League match. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Get Sky Sports Find out more about Sky Sports A loan move could be an option for Henderson, who still has three years remaining on his current deal, but there are question marks about which clubs would be prepared to pay the lion's share of his wages. It's thought Johnstone's availability on a free transfer means United are keen to sign him, and then consider Henderson's future. Ironically, both Henderson and Johnstone are desperate for regular top-flight football in order to re-ignite the interest of England manager Gareth Southgate. Spurs, meanwhile, were close to a deal for Johnstone in January, but decided not to pursue their interest as they prioritised other positions in the squad. Antonio Conte is keen to have more competition for Hugo Lloris, who signed an improved contract in January at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

Top-flight clubs voted in favour of the substitution rule change at a shareholder meeting of all 20 Premier League clubs on Thursday. Five substitutes were originally introduced in May 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, but the league reverted back to three subs for the 2020/21 season and this campaign. Previously, teams had voted against the introduction of five substitutes on several occasions in the past two years. The Premier League have also confirmed the summer transfer window will open on Friday June 10 and will close at 11pm on Thursday September 1. The league also announced a change to Covid-19 testing, with only symptomatic individuals to be tested from Monday. A Premier League statement said: ""Premier League Shareholders met today and discussed a range of matters. ""Clubs agreed to change the rules relating to substitute players. From next season, clubs will be permitted to use five substitutions, to be made on three occasions during a match, with an additional opportunity at half-time. A total of nine substitutes can be named on the team sheet.

""In addition, the Premier League has today updated its remaining COVID-19 measures. ""From 4 April, the League will remove twice-weekly COVID-19 testing of players and staff and move to symptomatic testing only. Other key updates include the removal of the requirement for clinical passports to access previously restricted areas at training grounds and on match days as the Premier League returns to business-as-usual operations. ""The wellbeing of players and staff remains a priority and the Premier League will continue to monitor the national COVID-19 situation and adapt League-wide protocols as required, in line with the latest guidance from public health authorities and medical experts."" Maheta Molango, chief executive of the PFA, said the implementation of the five substitution rule would help tackle issues surrounding player fatigue. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""When meeting our members, the most common issue they want to discuss is the impact of fixture congestion,"" Molango said. ""It's clear to me that the number of games being played is directly affecting players' health and wellbeing. ""The adoption of this rule is a welcome step forward in what needs to be an ongoing effort to address issues with player fatigue, making sure they have the opportunity to perform at their best and to maintain the competitive edge that makes English football the best in the world."" In December 2021, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said players were ""at the edge"" due to the demands of the fixture schedule and absences caused by Covid, and called for five subs. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""We have to put the competition aside and don't say that Man City has better subs than Burnley or whatever,"" said the German. ""Yes that's probably true. But the problem is the intensity for a top-class footballer in England is definitely at the edge. ""You bring players back after Covid or after an injury, and because of the games we have to play they have to play immediately. Then they are out again because you cannot get them off after 60 minutes because you have to change other things. ""This wonderful game is so wonderful because usually the players on the pitch are in good shape, are well-trained, have recovered and go for it. That's why we love the game. ""The best league in the world, and the most intense league in the world, is the only league with still three subs. That's not right. We should change it."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Man City boss Pep Guardiola and Chelsea head coach Thomas Tuchel are also both strong advocates of five substitutions. In December 2020, Guardiola said: ""All around the world it's five substitutions, but here we believe we are more special people. ""We don't protect the players, and that's why it's a disaster. In this calendar, especially. I will demand, if the people allow, we have to come back to five substitutions. If not, it's difficult to sustain it."" Meanwhile, Tuchel said in December 2021: ""I would love to push for five substitutions because five substitutions were made to protect the players when coronavirus popped up and made life difficult. ""I think the situation is very serious and very challenging so if we decided to keep on playing at least we should have five changes to control the load."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  But some - such as Sean Dyche, the Burnley manager - believed allowing five subs disproportionately benefits bigger clubs, such as Liverpool. ""I think it quite obviously favours the big clubs because they can keep more players happy and more players involved by making more changes,"" Dyche said in July 2020. ""A lot of football often does. We all had to change the size of our home pitches to make sure they aligned with the big clubs who were in Europe.

""It could be a slightly calmer situation for managers [of bigger clubs] with players who get slightly disgruntled than if they're out of the team and out of the squad."" As we approach what promises to be a busy transfer window, Sky Sports takes a look at 50 players who could be on the move this summer... Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe, who became the world's most expensive teenager when signed from Monaco for £166m in 2018, is out of contract at the end of the season, with Real Madrid the favourites to sign him. Real had a £145m bid for Mbappe rejected last summer - after he requested to leave PSG - and the French club are still holding out hope of convincing their star forward to stay. Borrusia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland is expected to be on the move this summer when his £64m release clause comes into effect, with top clubs across Europe fighting for his signature. Manchester City are in pole position to sign the 21-year-old, who has a contract with Dortmund until the summer of 2024, should he move to the Premier League. Barcelona and Real Madrid are reportedly also in the running to sign Haaland, and there is a suggestion Bayern Munich could be interested with Robert Lewandowski's future seemingly up in the air. Harry Kane asked to leave Tottenham last summer but ended up staying in north London after the club resisted multiple offers from Manchester City. Spurs are in no rush to sell Kane, who has a contract until 2024, but there have been reports Manchester United are set to reignite their interest in the 28-year-old England striker this summer.

Pogba has not received any contract offer from United since last summer and is set to leave Old Trafford on a free transfer for the second time. A host of Europe's biggest clubs, including Real Madrid, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus, are interested in the 29-year-old. Sky Sports News has been told Pogba's final choice over his next move will be a ""football decision"", and remaining in the Premier League has not been ruled out by the France international. If Pogba goes to a European club, it is unlikely he will be offered more money than United were willing to pay when they offered him a new deal last summer. Sky Sports reported last week that Pogba was hurt by the reaction of United supporters who booed him when he was substituted during their 3-2 win over Norwich earlier this month. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Ralf Rangnick, United's intertim manager, said after the game: ""I don't think it makes sense to take on and to target any individual person or players."" Transfer Centre LIVE! Paper Talk: Pogba sends final message to Man Utd team-mates Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Pogba was also substituted during United's 4-0 hammering at the hands of Liverpool last week due to injury and is set to miss the rest of the season, meaning he has likely played his last game for the club. Pogba first joined United from Le Havre as a teenager in 2009 but ran down his contract before he had broken into the first team in order to join Juventus. The midfielder rejoined United from the Italian club for a then-world record fee in 2016 and won the League Cup and the Europa League during his first season back at Old Trafford. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  But while he has lifted the World Cup and Nations League with France since then, further silverware at club level has failed to materialise. Pogba previously appeared close to a United exit towards the end of Jose Mourinho's spell as manager after their relationship deteriorated. Mourinho prevented Pogba from captaining the club, while the pair were also filmed having a confrontation during training. However, Mourinho was sacked just months later and Pogba was reintegrated into the squad by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Injury has limited Pogba to just 21 starts in all competitions this season, and he and the club will end the season empty-handed again.

Asked whether it was fair to describe Pogba as ""enigmatic"", Rangnick replied: ""It doesn't make sense to talk about that - right now he's injured. ""But I mean, he's a player that won the World Cup with France. We all know what kind of potential he has and the good player he can be. ""But like quite a few other players, he was just struggling to get his best performances sustainably on the pitch for United matches. This was not only the case this season, or in the last couple of weeks. As far as I remember, this was also the case in earlier years."" Rangnick said it was ""difficult to say"" why that was the case. ""If myself or other coaches knew that, it would probably have been easier to change that,"" he added. ""But right now it doesn't make sense to think about that. As it seems right now, he will not renew his contract. It's most likely that he won't be here anymore next season.""

Supporters' patience has been wearing thin with players as the club's top-four tilt wilted with a 3-1 defeat at Arsenal - just four days after the humiliating 4-0 defeat to Liverpool. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Interim manager Ralf Rangnick has suggested up to 10 new players are needed for the impending rebuild, but we asked Sky Sports readers to decide who should stay or leave this summer. With United facing another crucial clash at home to Chelsea on Thursday, fans have been voting in our poll to determine who is good enough for the club, and who isn't. Collectively, we received 1.7m votes on 30 different United first-team players, so let's take a look at the results below… Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Paul Pogba, who is out of contract this summer and remains the second-most expensive player in Premier League history following his £93.25m transfer from Juventus in 2016, was axed by 91 per cent of fans - with the sentiment reflecting the hostile reception he received from fans after the 3-2 win over Norwich. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Club captain Harry Maguire joined the list of axed players, with more than three-quarters of voters opting to offload the England centre-back, while regular defensive partners Aaron Wan-Bissaka (65 per cent) and Victor Lindelof (52 per cent) were also jettisoned from the squad. Latest Man Utd news Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week A host of bit-part and loaned players were also discarded by fans, including Nemanja Matic (94 per cent), Phil Jones (90 per cent), Juan Mata (89 per cent), Andreas Pereira (87 per cent), Anthony Martial (86 per cent), Edinson Cavani (86 per cent) and Jesse Lingard (82 per cent). Most poignantly, 85 per cent of fans voted to ditch the Glazers - who took control of the club 17 years ago in 2005 and have come under growing scrutiny during the club's five-year barren run without a trophy. Which players still have the vote of confidence from the United faithful? At the top of our keep list is Jadon Sancho, who enjoyed a one-month purple patch until mid-March - with 94 per cent of fans backing the England winger, while talisman Bruno Fernandes (91 per cent) received a similar share of votes. Fernandes has nine goals and 13 assists in all competitions this season and signed a contract extension until 2026 earlier this month. The statistics do prove, however, that the midfielder is having a weaker season compared to last term across several attacking factors - but that could be down to United having a poorer campaign across the board. In terms of regular starters, David de Gea (88 per cent), Raphael Varane (85 per cent), Scott McTominay (75 per cent), Luke Shaw (69 per cent), Cristiano Ronaldo (64 per cent) and Fred (62 per cent) were retained by fans, while Marcus Rashford (57 per cent) and Alex Telles (53 per cent) made the cut by the skin of their teeth. Anthony Elanga, who has moved above Rashford in the pecking order under Rangnick, has endured a mixed start to 2022 but is still liked by his club's supporters with 90 per cent voting to keep him for next term - with fellow youngsters Hannibal Mejbri (80 per cent) and Amad Diallo (67 per cent) also proving to be fan favourites. Elanga missed the crucial penalty in the FA Cup exit to Middlesbrough in February, but redeemed himself by being the hero in United's Champions League last-16 first-leg draw at Atletico Madrid before Diego Simeone's side dumped United out of the competition in the return leg.

Sky Sports News understands United will prioritise a new centre-back, two central midfielders, a winger and a striker this summer, while also examining their full-back and goalkeeping options. But in order to strengthen their squad under their next manager - Ajax boss Erik Ten Hag - the club must first make room by clearing the decks. Here, we take a look at the players facing uncertain futures at Old Trafford, from those who are approaching the ends of their contracts, to those who simply don't seem to fit in any longer. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Pogba has not been offered new terms by United since last summer. In March, Sky Sports News reported that Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus were all in talks with his representatives, as well as two Premier League clubs. He came off with a knock in the early stages of Tuesday's game against Liverpool and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville questioned whether it was the last time we would see Pogba in a United shirt. VOTE: Who should stay or leave Man Utd this summer? Premier League table Live football on Sky Sports Get Sky Sports His future at Old Trafford has been uncertain for several seasons. He spent the second half of last term on loan at West Ham and they wanted to sign him permanently last summer. He stayed but has again failed to cement a first-team place. He was also a target for Newcastle in January. He is expected to leave this summer, with Tottenham one of a number of clubs who have been monitoring his situation. On Tuesday night, Roy Keane said he should have left two years ago. The 33-year-old Spaniard looks set to end an eight-year spell at Old Trafford having been on the periphery of the first team all season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mata has made only seven appearances in all competitions this term. There are no options left in his contract and no talks about a renewal. Reports in Spain claim he is not ready to retire and could return to play in La Liga. Matic has already confirmed publicly he will not take up the option he has in his contract of a further year, and will leave the club on a free at the end of the campaign. The Sky Sports punditry team questioned why he announced this before the end of the season with the team still fighting to finish fourth. The 35-year-old agreed to ignore interest from his native South America and sign another one-year deal last summer but has not featured regularly, making just 12 Premier League appearances and struggling with injuries. He reportedly fancies a move to Spain this summer. English goalkeeper who has made up the homegrown quota and provided extra cover in goal, but has not played this season and is expected to find a new club. De Gea, who has an option for an additional year in his contract ending in 2023, recently said he does not see himself away from Manchester United but he has flirted with a return to Madrid in the past, both to his former club Atletico and their rivals Real. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  His wife is a successful television presenter there and is believed to spend most of her time in the city. He has remained one of United's better players this season but Ten Hag likes a 'keeper who can build from the back in the same way Ederson and Alisson do for City and Liverpool. Does De Gea fit that mould? Regardless, he would be hard to replace. In January, Ronaldo's representatives were quick to shut down reports he was unhappy at United and already considering leaving in the summer, less than a year since his return to the club. He has been stellar when he has played, scoring match-winning hat-tricks against Tottenham and Norwich in recent months, and he will want to see his team-mates match his incredibly high standards between now and the end of the season. He will have no shortage of lucrative options should he indicate he is ready to go this summer. His contract ends in 2023 but he has an option to extend it by another year. Rashford has struggled to find his best form again this season under both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Rangnick, and it seems he has been impacted by the arrivals of Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho in two of the positions in which he thrives. He is young and dynamic enough that he should be one Ten Hag will want to have a close look at. But recent reports claim Rashford is considering his future at Old Trafford. Should he stay, the club have an option to extend his contract by a year. Shaw, another player whose contract includes a one-year extension option for the club, is reportedly happy at United and willing to extend his deal further. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  However, like most of the squad, his form has been sporadic this season and Rangnick has appeared to prefer Alex Telles or Diogo Dalot at left-back. Shaw has been injured recently and will almost certainly be another player Ten Hag will want to assess first before making any decisions on his future. One of United's priorities this summer is to sign at least one new central midfielder, given Pogba and Matic are set to leave. What these new additions will mean for Fred remains to be seen, but he has been one of the better performers when he has played this season. His energetic style ought to fit with Ten Hag's philosophy and there is a one-year extension option in his contract. Surprised everybody when he signed a new contract until 2023 in 2019, which also contains an option until 2024. He has made only three appearances this season and looked far short of a level required in Tuesday's thrashing by Liverpool. It is very hard to see how he would fit into Ten Hag's plans. Signing a new centre-back is definitely on the cards for United this summer. Heaton was brought in to add further cover in goal and has an option to extend his time at Old Trafford, but United are expected to be in the market for another goalkeeper this summer, meaning his future is up in the air. He has made only one first-team appearance. Dalot's situation at United has been up and down since he arrived under Jose Mourinho. He was on loan at AC Milan last season and did exceptionally well, and was expected to head there permanently. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Instead, he stayed and had a good start to the campaign but dropped off again before another minor resurgence under Rangnick. Nevertheless, with just a year left on his deal, it might be time to cash in on the Portugal international and sign a right-back fully in the Ten Hag mould. The England goalkeeper has been frustrated with his lack of opportunities at United for several seasons, especially after thriving during two loan spells at Sheffield United. He is of interest to a string of other Premier League clubs where he could expect to be in line for the No.1 shirt, so he is expected to push again for an exit this summer. Bailly has made only seven appearances this season, despite signing a new contract until 2025 (if its option is taken into account) last year. United want to sign another new centre-back this summer, despite signing Raphaël Varane from Real Madrid last year, which would push Bailly even further down the pecking order. Martial is currently on loan at Sevilla having fallen out of favour under both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick this season. Sky Sports News exclusively revealed in December that he wanted to join the Spanish club in January to get more first-team games. It remains to be seen whether Sevilla want to keep him permanently, but there were other clubs also interested in signing him and his future at Old Trafford looks far from certain. The young left-back, who has been fourth in the pecking order behind Shaw, Telles and Dalot, has been on loan with relegation-battlers Norwich City this season. For his development, he will need to continue playing regular games next season which - at United - is unlikely. Another Saturday, another chance to become a millionaire! Super 6.

But Brentford striker Ivan Toney has now eclipsed all of those who fell short before him and broken Glenn Murray's record of the most goals scored in a Sky Bet Championship campaign, since the division's rebrand in 2004, by hitting his 31st goal of the season in the Bees' 3-1 win over Bristol City. The bar was set by Murray in 2012/13, when he notched 30 goals as Crystal Palace were promoted to the Premier League under Ian Holloway, after a narrow 1-0 play-off final win over Watford at Wembley. Toney had never played in the second tier prior to joining the west London club for an initial £5m as Ollie Watkins' replacement last August, yet to say he had taken to it like a duck to water would be quite the understatement. Here, we take a look at how the 25-year-old rewrote the history books... Prior to joining Brentford, Toney had expressed to Sky Sports his belief he was capable of playing in the top flight of English football. It was understandable, given his earlier stint at Newcastle, but a minority took his self-confidence for an over-inflated ego, which was fuelled by the fact he failed to score in his first four appearances for Thomas Frank's team. Then came the turning point. Having bounced back from a second successive opening-day defeat to Birmingham with a 3-0 triumph over Huddersfield in the first league game at the brand new Brentford Community Stadium, the Bees travelled to south east London to take on Millwall, who they had beaten just once on the road since 1984. REPORT: Bristol City 1-3 Brentford Championship table Listen to the Sky Sports EFL Podcast Get Sky Sports The game followed a familiar pattern, as Jed Wallace struck an early opener, but midway through the first half, Toney won a penalty and gave a glimpse at what was to come when he approached the ball in a slow, menacing manner and coolly rolled it past Lions goalkeeper Bartosz Bialkowski into the bottom left corner. There was no overzealous response; he cupped his hands to his ears, celebrated as his team-mates closed in and, ultimately, earned his side a point as the game ended 1-1. The delight on his face was evident when he added two more against Preston eight days later - though the Bees would go on to concede four second half goals in an eventual 4-2 collapse - while he displayed his prowess in the six-yard box with two more against Coventry before yet another double away at Sheffield Wednesday on October 21. Further strikes against Norwich and Luton took him to a final tally of eight goals in just six games throughout October meant there was little surprise when Toney was presented with the Sky Bet Championship Player of the Month award. ""I would never have thought I'd be in this position at the beginning of the season but I did believe in myself and I know what I'm capable of and it's starting to really show,"" he told Sky Sports in November. ""I've believed in myself, and the manager, all the staff and the players have helped me. ""I feel like everyone is a team player; there's no individuals or standouts. I know I've been scoring the goals but without them I wouldn't have been able to score them. Everyone wants the same goal at the end, which is to get promoted."" The fabled Player of the Month curse was nowhere to be seen when he started November by slamming the opener in a 1-1 draw against Swansea and though he drew a blank in stalemates against Middlesbrough and Wycombe thereafter, a deft header was enough for Brentford to take the plaudits at Oakwell on November 24. Toney's strike just after the hour mark then sealed a 2-1 west London derby win over QPR three days later, before penalties against Rotherham and Blackburn increased his tally to 14 goals by the first week of December. He added two more with goals against Nottingham Forest and QPR but given how consistently he was scoring in the early part of the season, it was perhaps to be expected that a seven-game barren spell in all competitions would follow. It wasn't all gloom and doom by any stretch, though, with the frontman once again illustrating he is just as capable of creating chances for team-mates as he is finishing them off himself by laying on three assists. His tally now stands at 10 for the season, which has only been bettered Norwich's Emi Buendia (16), Reading's Michael Olise (12), Blackburn's Harvey Elliott and Cardiff's Harry Wilson (both 11). It was perhaps to be expected that such a run would screech to a halt in devastating style on the final weekend of January. It was a perfect storm for Toney. He had a burning desire to get back on the scoresheet, Brentford had not lost in 17 games and Wycombe were rooted to the bottom of the table. There was no doubt about the penalty he rolled home 11 minutes after the break, or the tricky effort he struck past Ryan Allsop while off-balance, but it was his first of the day - which had been credited to Tariqe Fosu, who prodded in from close-range after Allsop had made the initial save - that forced him to wait for confirmation of a hat-trick. A confident Toney commandeered the match ball on the day and a few days later, the treble was officially ratified as the ball was adjudged to have crossed the line prior to Fosu's intervention. That ignited another hot streak, where he scored five goals in the next six games - including one in the defeat to QPR - and then, on February 27, he scored his 25th of the season in the 2-1 win over Stoke, equalling the tally reached by Brentford frontmen Neal Maupay and Ollie Watkins across the past two seasons. It was an admirable achievement for the player, but also for Brentford, who became the first EFL club to have three different players score 25 league goals in consecutive seasons since the 1960s. It was made all the more incredible by the fact Maupay and Watkins had reached 25 at the end of the season - Toney still had 13 games still to play. There were fears that he might have been missing for a large chunk of the Bees' run-in, given the fact he was forced to sit out the disappointing 2-0 defeat to Coventry with an ankle injury. Many breathed a sigh of relief, however, when he appeared from the bench against Sheffield Wednesday and started in the aforementioned game against the Potters, with the injury not as bad as initially feared. Though he could only muster one shot on target in the Bees' showdown with Norwich on March 3, Toney was soon among the goals again and, prior to the March international break, had scored penalties in three games in succession. On each occasion, with ice coursing through his veins, he found the back of the net in trademark fashion. ""It's a little stroll, just nice and slow. Stare at the 'keeper, let him make the move. When he makes the move, pass it in to the other corner,"" he explained to the Official EFL Podcast, in the most nonchalant manner. As Brentford recovered from four straight draws - two either side of the March international break - to get their automatic promotion quest heading in the right direction again with a 5-0 demolition of Preston at Deepdale, Toney became just the third man to hit the 29-goal mark in the division when he glanced in at the back post after Fosu had invitingly hung the ball up to the far post. With the fixtures ticking by, he then drew blanks against Millwall, Cardiff and Bournemouth. In the latter, he was given the freedom of the south coast when a superb pass found its way to him, but with the pressure building, his effort was saved by Asmir Begovic in the Cherries' goal. Fears he might not break the record that looked within reach, naturally, began to arise, particularly given the fact Brentford secured a play-off place with three games to spare and against Rotherham - in the third-to-last - the closest he came was in the first half of a 1-0 win, when he drove in from the right and crashed a shot off the right-hand post. A few days later, though, he cracked it. With almost an hour gone in the Bees' eventual 2-0 home win against Watford, he was caught by Francisco Sierralta as he turned in the area and was presented with a golden chance to level with Murray from the spot. Goalkeeper Daniel Bachmann guessed correctly, but Toney's delivery escaped his clutches and hit the bottom right corner of the net. The smile and punch of the air illustrated exactly how much the milestone meant to him. Then, on the final day of the season, when Frank may have preferred to rest his prized asset for the play-offs, Toney started at Ashton Gate and duly made history when Marcus Forss' shot was deflected into his path, allowing him to slot goal No 31 past former Brentford stopper Daniel Bentley. Regardless of Brentford's fate this season, it's plain to see Ivan Toney will likely be a Premier League player next season. His work in the Championship is almost complete but he's creating a legacy with a record that has the potential to remain in place for many years to come.

With four goals in August, six in September, eight in October, a hat-trick against West Brom, a brace against QPR and Nottingham Forest, Mitrovic is simply bullying Championship defenders into submission with his power in the air and strength on the ground. Mitrovic said: ""I have a lot of quality around me in this team, a lot of creative players who make a lot of chances for me, so I have to thank them for helping me to score as many goals as I did in October. ""Thank you also to the manager for his trust in me, and the fans for their support. It is a nice award to win, but the most pleasing thing was that we also won lots of games."" Sky Sports' EFL pundit Don Goodman said: ""Can he be stopped? If he can, we're yet to see it happen. ""Mitrovic added eight goals to his already impressive tally in October and the Fulham front man is showing few signs of slowing down. ""With the Championship goal-scoring record firmly in his sights, don't be surprised if he claims another player of the month award or two before the season is out."" Championship fixtures Championship table Bournemouth manager Scott Parker has been named the Sky Bet Championship Manager of the Month for October. Parker led his team to a perfect 15 points from five games, with 10 goals scored and four clean sheets as they dominated the Championship. Even the one goal they conceded led to a confidence-building comeback win over Sheffield United. Parker said: ""I have to give full credit for this award to my staff and players for their efforts throughout October and the season as a whole. ""To secure a 100%-win record in a month and concede just one goal in the Championship is a fantastic achievement and it is testament to the hard work and mentality of everyone at the club. ""We're also extremely grateful for the backing we've been given from our supporters, who have followed us in great numbers home and away this season."" Sky Sports' EFL pundit Don Goodman said: ""Scott Parker claims this honour for the second month running and October's winner really couldn't have been anyone else. ""Bournemouth were almost picture perfect over the course of the month, conceding just one goal in a five-game run that bagged the Cherries 15 crucial points as they strive for promotion back to the top-flight."" Player: Michael Smith, Rotherham Rotherham United striker Michael Smith has been named the Sky Bet League One Player of the Month for October. Enjoying one of his most prolific seasons, Smith scored five goals and assisted two others in five games, using his physicality in the box to hold off defenders. His cheeky backheeled goal against Sunderland underlined his current confidence. Rotherham manager Paul Warne said: ""It's great for Smudge. He's scored a lot of goals, but as always, his overall play has been fundamental to our success. ""It is a weird one because I don't think any particular player should get a personal accolade as it is a team effort, and this really is as much of an award for the group as much as it is for Smudge. ""I think he is one of a lot of our players who are in really good form at the moment and long may that continue. ""Smudge does loads of work to keep himself fit and a lot of extra behind-the-scenes that people don't see. He is more than deserving of Player of the Month, and I think him scoring as many goals as he has, it has possibly pushed him over the edge for this award. ""In my opinion, he hasn't played any better in this month than he has in the others that he has since he signed for us, but it is nice to see his efforts recognised externally."" Smith said: ""I'm obviously delighted to get the award but I think it isn't just recognising my efforts, but also the team's in what has been a great run for us. Sky Sports' EFL pundit Don Goodman said: ""Rotherham are on a fine run towards the top of Sky Bet League One and much of their recent form has been influenced by the performances of their striker. ""The physical Michael Smith is having the season of his life and October was him at his prolific best, firing in five goals in as many games for the Millers."" Manager: Ryan Lowe, Plymouth Plymouth Argyle manager Ryan Lowe has been named the Sky Bet League One Manager of the Month for October. Lowe has underlined to his players the importance of turning Devon into a fortress this season. A perfect three wins from three at Home Park were part of a 14-point haul from six unbeaten matches which took Argyle to the summit of League One. Lowe said: I'm delighted to win the award, but it is not just recognition for me - it also reflects the work done by my back-room staff, players, our fans, and everyone involved at the club throughout the season so far. ""Of course, I am always proud to pick up any honour, but there is a lot of the season still left to play and we will keep working hard and have our feet firmly on the ground."" Sky Sports' EFL pundit Don Goodman said: ""Ryan Lowe had a clear vision for Plymouth Argyle and, with increasing pace, his long-term plan is really starting to come to fruition at Home Park. ""The Pilgrims' rise has been remarkable and with monthly tallies of 14 points under their belt, the Plymouth fanbase can be excused for their whispers of Championship promotion."" Player: Dom Telford, Newport Newport County striker Dom Telford has been named the Sky Bet League Two Player of the Month for October. It was a month of transition for Newport in the dugout, but one to die for on the pitch for Telford. He contributed an assist and eight goals, including a clever shot on the swivel and a brilliant solo run against Carlisle, as well as a hat-trick against Stevenage. Newport County manager James Rowberry said: ""I can't take any credit for [the form], that's down to Wayne [Hatswell, assistant manager and caretaker after Michael Flynn's departure] and the guys that were here before me. He's scored a few since I came in against Bristol Rovers and Stevenage. ""First and foremost he's a great, great lad. He's 24, he comes in every day with a smile on his face - I see him and he makes me smile and makes me laugh! He's a great lad and the lads love him. ""He works every day, always wants to get better, he's always asking questions, asking me questions. He's engaged and he deserves. I know Dom will continue and that journey and continue wanting to get better and better."" Sky Sports' EFL pundit Don Goodman said: ""Telford just couldn't stop scoring in October, putting together a superb run of eight goals in six games, including an irresistible hat-trick at home to Stevenage. ""The strikes contributed to an unbeaten month for Newport, which may prove vital when we look back at the season in May."" Manager: Darrell Clarke, Port Vale Port Vale manager Darrell Clarke has been named the Sky Bet League Two Manager of the Month for October. It was a stellar month for his swashbuckling side, who scored at least three goals in five of their six games. That made 17 in total to add to their 13 October points. Clarke's tactic of trying to out-score the opposition appears to be working. Clarke said: ""I'm really pleased to win the award for a second consecutive month, once again it's all down to a great collective effort from everyone involved in the club, from my players and backroom staff, to the owners and supporters."" Sky Sports' EFL pundit Don Goodman said: ""Free-scoring Port Vale are on quite the run at the moment, with Darrell Clarke more than deserved of back-to-back manager of the month wins. ""Vale games are rarely dull due to Clarke's attacking philosophy and although it carries obvious risks, it's paying dividends at the moment with 13 points accumulated in October.""

The club - who were only promoted to the EFL for the first time in their history after winning the National League play-offs in 2017 - have ambitions of reaching the Championship and have now inched closer to realising that eventual dream. Promotion comes after they fell to a dramatic defeat to Newport in last year's play-off semi-finals, which came two years after a semi-final defeat against Tranmere. It also marks a remarkable first season in professional football management for former Wales international Rob Edwards. Here, we hear from reporter Laurie Martin and fan Chris Latham, who explain the impact of promotion... Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Gloucestershire Live's Laurie Martin: ""Forest Green have been a joy to watch this season. Rob Edwards, his staff and players have achieved something very special in a short space of time. ""The first week of the season set the tone for what was to come - winning the opening game of the season against Sutton in stoppage time, before beating Bristol City on penalties in the Carabao Cup. Edwards has brought a swashbuckling style to The New Lawn, playing an attacking 3-4-1-2 system, which sees Rovers as the division's top scorers. ""This is largely the same group of players that Mark Cooper had available to him last season, but Edwards has brought the very best out of every individual. He gave everyone the chance to impress during pre-season, which pumped belief and confidence into each player. It was a clean slate for everyone. ""Look at Matty Stevens, for example. Last season he played 170 minutes for Forest Green, was loaned out to Stevenage in January, and some wondered if he might move on last summer. Edwards gave him an opportunity, he's scored 27 goals in all competitions, and could well have won the golden boot had it not been for his season-ending ACL injury that he sustained at the start of April. ""He's also given the players a lot of freedom. In pre-season, he had a phone call with every player, asking them where they feel their best position is and what formation they felt as though they should play. Every player speaks highly of his man-management skills. ""Having played until fairly recently, and having coached Wolves and England youth teams before joining Forest Green, he understands how to connect with players. He's clearly a talented coach, but he has empathy and good communication skills - which he sees as being just as important. ""He's also built up a wonderful rapport with the supporters, which was something seriously lacking under his predecessor. ""Stroud isn't a football mad area, and Forest Green are one of the smaller-supported clubs in the EFL, but it means everything to the fans. Some fans still can't believe Forest Green are in the Football League, so next season really will be a real 'pinch me' moment when Rovers are facing ex-Premier League giants on a fairly regular basis. Forest Green will comfortably be the smallest club in League One, and they will relish coming up against the big boys next season. ""It's fairy tale stuff for fans of certain generations. Forest Green did the double 40 years ago - winning the FA Vase at the old Wembley against Rainworth Miners' Welfare and topping the Hellenic League. That just emphasises how far the club has come both under Dale Vince, and Trevor Horsley before him. ""Obviously, when Vince joined the club, he made his intentions and ambitions very clear, and it's well-publicised that reaching the Championship is his goal. Rovers have been knocking on the door of League One for a few years, but they've suffered play-off heartbreak on two occasions, and just haven't been able to get over the line. ""Some might take a look at Forest Green winning promotion and just throw the 'moneybags' tag at them, but those days are gone. Rovers still have a healthy and competitive budget, reported to be the eighth highest in League Two, but it's not like the days when they overspent on experienced players in the National League. ""Rovers have the third youngest squad in the division and director of football Rich Hughes has developed a clear recruitment policy of buying young players either from non-league or released from Premier League & Championship academies, developing them, and then selling them on. They're going about things in the right way. ""Forest Green have been on an upwards trajectory for quite a while, and the ambition is to make the Championship, but firstly, it's going to be some ride in League One. When Rovers were promoted to League Two, it was like 'wow, we're going to be playing Notts County, Swindon and Coventry', but next season it'll be Derby, Ipswich and probably one of Sheffield Wednesday or Sunderland. It's a different kettle of fish entirely. ""Next season will be the most historic in the club's 133-year history, and it'll be all about staying up in the third tier. Rovers can definitely take inspiration from local rivals Cheltenham, who have survived with ease on their return to League One. ""Structurally, the club feel as though they've been operating as a League One outfit for the last couple of seasons, so there is definitely confidence from within that they can give life in the third tier a right good go. They will certainly ruffle a few feathers next season. ""Promotion is wrapped up, and of course that is a wonderful achievement, but after being top of League Two since September 11, lifting the title really would round off the season perfectly."" Forest Green fan Chris Latham: ""What an unbelievable season it has been - words probably can't do it justice - I was confident that we would build on our recent play-off appearances, but I wasn't expecting it to be quite this good! For most of the season we have been relentlessly good and it's been a joy to watch. Positive attacking football built on a strong defence has made us a very consistent both home and away. ""We may have lost in the play-off semi-final last season, but Jimmy Ball ignited something in the club and created a real sense of unity and purpose. Rob Edwards and his coaching staff have built on that and taken it further. The coaches and players have spoken of learning from the experience of the play-offs and not wanting to leave it to chance this time and I think they have backed that up on the pitch. It's been quite incredible to watch. ""Rob has created an environment that every fan dreams of. The fans, players and coaching staff hold a really special bond. It's a really positive, friendly and fun place to be, but alongside that there is a tremendous sense of responsibility and honesty when things don't go as well as would like. Edwards has a really bright future ahead - the sky is the limit. ""Promotion is a fantastic achievement. We are a club from the local county leagues with a unique history compared to many other EFL clubs. We were the first club to reach the FA Vase and Trophy final and we will be in League One next season, which is quite simply incredible. ""Initially, I was a little sceptical about the club's plans to challenge higher up the divisions, but in recent years I think Dale Vince has shown a really clear vision and shown he can deliver on it. He has given a clear identity to our footballing style and wider culture of giving young players a chance. He gives his managers support, but importantly gives them time and space to achieve. Dale deserves much more credit for the way he runs the footballing side of the club. ""We can't wait to take in more new clubs next season and it shows why English football is so special with our football pyramid making it possible for clubs to work their way up. As a fan, it's priceless to witness the progress and for the club it will also mean the important environmental messages will reach a wider audience. ""The new training facilities are a really important milestone, too, with the club soon able to unite the men's, women's and academy teams in one place. The stadium will also take us to a ground which is sustainable as an EFL ground and it looks like a really brilliant place to watch football. The future is very exciting - Forest Green in the Championship? It's not if, but when."" Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6. Play for free, entries by 3pm ",positive

After only previously signing Donny van de Beek during the summer transfer window, United completed four signings in the 24 hours that followed their 6-1 mauling at home to Tottenham even though Jadon Sancho, who United have chased all summer, remained at Dortmund and an enquiry to Watford for winger Ismaila Sarr didn't progress. Instead United recruited left-back Alex Telles for a fee of £15.4m, brought in 18-year-old Pellistri and signed Atlanta winger Amad Diallo, in a deal that could be worth up to £37.2m. The 18-year-old, who has only played 24 minutes in Serie A, will join the club in January. Cavani, 33, has signed a one-year contract with the option of a further 12 months and is expected to wear the club's iconic number seven shirt. ""Clearly Edinson Cavani has the work-ethic, the hunger to be a success at Manchester United,"" reported Sky Sports News' James Cooper. ""He's been impressed by the project he's been offered by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and in return Solskjaer has been impressed by Cavani. ""Solskjaer has said he will score goals. He won't sit on the bench and he is someone who will deliver something they haven't got with their other striking options.

""You've got to have pace as Man United like to counter-attack with the pace of Anthony Martial, Greenwood, Marcus Rashford and Dan James when he's in the team,"" said Merson. ""Now, all of a sudden Cavani comes in. He'll hold the ball up, but for me it's a panic. I hope I'm wrong but it's not a future signing and it's not one that tells me they're moving forward. ""It's not one that tells me that in three or four years they're going to catch up with Liverpool and Man City. This is not going to catch those two clubs up now."" How do you explain 'Silly Sunday?' - Listen to the latest Pitch to Post Podcast on Apple | Spotify But it was not one-way traffic at Old Trafford on Deadline Day, with Chris Smalling the club's highest-profile departure. The defender has joined Roma in an £18m deal. Smalling, who has signed a three-year deal at the Serie A club with the option of an additional year, had been pushing for a move back to Rome throughout the summer, where he impressed last year on a season-long loan. But should United have let him depart? ""I've watched Bailly and Lindelof,"" commented Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp. ""Smalling's gone to Italy and been successful there - I'm thinking he's better than what they've got."" Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol: ""This window has been dominated by the Jadon Sancho saga.

""He hasn't played for seven months, he scored seven times last season, they sold Romelu Lukaku 15 months ago, and 15 months later they're replacing him with a 33-year-old free agent with his injury record, paying him something between £200-250k a week. ""Compare the goalscoring records. Lukaku left Manchester United last season, he scored 38 times for Inter Milan, Cavani has scored seven times for PSG. ""Telles is a very good player, but he's played once for Brazil. A friendly against Panama.

Edwin van der Sar at Ajax [where he is the club's CEO].""  Sky Sports' Ron Walker: ""Facundo Pellistri is not a name many Manchester United fans will have heard of a week ago, and it might be a while before he's regularly running out at Old Trafford. ""However, there's no doubting the potential of the 18-year-old winger, who was given his blessing before leaving for Europe by club manager Diego Forlan - someone who knows as well as anyone the challenge of making it at United. ""Pellistri is known for for his raw pace and has been deployed by Penarol as a right midfielder and on the right of a front three this season, but has been predominantly seen as a forward player for his club side.

The offer was for an initial £73m, rising to up to £91.3m, which fell short of Dortmund's £108m valuation. Sancho has not flown with the rest of the Dortmund squad for the German Super Cup in Munich against Bayern due to a ""respiratory infection"". He has tested negative for Covid-19. A bid was expected from the Premier League club this week, but all of the noises coming from Dortmund would suggest Sancho is staying in Germany. Earlier on Tuesday, Dortmund captain Marco Reus told Sky in Germany Sancho is staying for one more year. United have not given up on trying to sign the 20-year-old, despite missing the August 10 deadline the Bundesliga club had set for the deal to be completed. Despite the Dortmund hierarchy stating on several occasions - both before and after the deadline - that if it was not met Sancho would remain with the club, rumblings have continued over United submitting a bid before the transfer window closes on October 5. 'Man Utd can't do dark arts of transfers' Transfer Centre live! Man Utd transfer rumours Get Sky Sports United made a breakthrough in negotiations with Sancho's representatives earlier this month, with wages and agents fees no longer thought to be an issue for the Premier League club. However, on September 23, Dharmesh Sheth told The Transfer Show Borussia Dortmund had been left ""bemused"" by United's attempts to sign the England forward. United's only signing of the window so far has been central midfielder Donny van de Beek from Ajax, but manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has suggested the club are still hoping to do more business. If United do manage to agree a deal for Sancho with Dortmund, it could have an impact on England's preparations for October's international fixtures. With the Premier League's transfer window closing on Monday, United's pursuit of the winger could extend into Deadline Day - the same day in which England's squad are expected to arrive for duty. If Sancho is required to leave England's secure eco-bubble to undergo a medical, he would not be allowed to return, according to UEFA's coronavirus protocols. Gareth Southgate and his staff will want to limit disruption to their preparations, given how little time they have had to work with their players in recent months. An alternative to Sancho having to leave the camp could be to allow a small group of medical staff from United into the England bubble to conduct the tests. This would be within UEFA's rules as staff from Premier League clubs are regularly tested for coronavirus.

109,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/12085132/donny-van-de-beek-how-judo-helped-make-manchester-united-midfielder,Donny van de Beek: How judo helped make Manchester United midfielder,"Judo and badminton might not be the first two sports that one thinks of when working out how to build a footballer but perhaps that shows a lack of imagination. There were those at Ajax who saw it differently. Manchester United's Donny van de Beek is among a generation of talent who have benefited from the innovative ideas of Dutch coach Rene Wormhoudt. It was Wormhoudt who developed the Athletic Skills Model adopted by Ajax in the first part of the last decade. The principle was that youngsters needed to compete in other disciplines to become the best athletes that they could be. Racket sports were incorporated into the programme and, yes, even a dojo built so that these budding starts could go toe to toe. As Wormhoudt explains, it was centred on one simple idea. ""Only focusing on football might not be the best way to become a football player."" Now working as a strength and conditioning coach for the Netherlands national team, Wormhoudt still has the opportunity to work with some of the players who came through the Ajax academy after his ideas were embraced. Van de Beek, now 23, was among them. ""I spoke with Donny about this when I knew we were going to talk,"" Wormhoudt tells Sky Sports via a video call from his Netherlands home. ""He would never have been involved with judo or badminton if we hadn't implemented it in the educational programme at that time."" But how has it helped him? Keane: Ole needs top four United struggle with dark arts Latest transfer rumours Get Sky Sports ""The badminton for a football player is very good for the agility, the footwork, the quickness, but it is also very useful for the hand-eye coordination, spatial awareness and rotations. If you cannot rotate on both sides at the top level you notice it and you are gone, more or less. We trained a lot with him on his left and right hand, his left and right foot."" So far, so sensible. But judo? ""I grew up with judo and martial arts,"" Wormhoudt explains. ""What I realised is that if you could fall well, if you could have a better balance as well as the skills, you could become a better football player. ""Judo makes you very aware of the fall and when you are not afraid of the floor you make different decisions in your balance strategy. Zlatan Ibrahimovic did martial arts and he was not afraid to fall. Some guys who played outside and did volleyball or were goalkeepers, they learned not to be afraid, but most players do not know how to fall properly. ""What I learned from doing judo is that even if someone is stronger than me, I can decide which way we go. I can use your strength to my advantage. In that way, if I am totally comfortable in my balance I can use it to my advantage when you push me. ""Another benefit is core strength. This is important to performance and injury prevention. Judo also has a completely different culture to football. It all brings you something that you can use on the field. You can excel more because you are exposed to different ideas."" Wormhoudt has become accustomed to resistance - not least from fellow coaches. While he once had the support of Louis van Gaal and other influential figures at Ajax, it is a club familiar with schisms, where the battlefield of ideas can be a bloody one. They have since moved away from a programme that saw as much as half the time spent on other sports. Parents too have questioned his methods. ""A lot of parents think that the only way to make a better player is to spend many hours on the pitch, but that is just a quantity idea. The idea that if I spend more hours on the pitch than you I am going to be better isn't right. What about quality? What am I actually doing? You still need to play football but it just a part of it. That is difficult for people to accept."" Wormhoudt understands elite sport and he is well aware that putting in the time on football details remains vital. But he is armed with the research that suggests there is a better way. ""My colleague Professor Savelsbergh showed me a study in the United Kingdom that revealed children who played three or more sports at the ages of 11 had significantly more chance of representing a national team in one of those sports. But what do we do when an 11-year-old kid is good at football? We tell them to stop playing tennis."" He tells stories of Johan Cruyff and his fascination with baseball, Marco van Basten and his rare talent with a racket in his hand. ""I worked a lot with him and he is the example of what I am telling you about. At the moment, he does a lot of squash, but back in the day, he was doing a lot of other sports. He even did diving, the backwards flip and so on. It helped him. ""Ruud van Nistelrooy told me that he did taekwondo and other sports and this helped him as a striker in football."" Again, his ideas are supported by evidence. ""There is a great piece of research from Belgium that underpinned my ideas at Ajax. They found that when you trained in one sport for two hours you had a certain motoric IQ. When you trained six hours your IQ went up. Logical. But when you trained for two hours in three different sports your IQ really went up. In fact, spending two hours doing three different sports was the equivalent of six hours doing one sport. So in less time you learn quicker. ""If you want to make a better football player, you want to make a better person and that all starts with the brain. That is a much bigger field. If you are skilful that is not going to be enough at the top level. There are so many other things that you need. ""The basic movement skills like climbing and moving to music are also very important for your motor skills, adaptation, decision-making and your pattern recognition and your anticipation. ""This variety is so important. You need different experiences because it helps your adaptive ability. You can make yourself very special if you can adapt better than the other guy. ""But if you do not train your adaptive abilities, you will have worse pattern recognition, anticipation, decision-making and so on. So we need to develop the brain. You need a healthy body too but if you don't see what is happening, it is too late and it looks horrible. ""It is just a more holistic approach."" Ajax has since moved away from that approach. ""Other people came in,"" says Wormhoudt. ""Go away with the dojo where they did the judo. Go away with the gymnastic hall. They could not get rid of the athletic skills track so it is still used for rehabilitation but it is not in the way that I had wanted or as intensely as it was. ""It is a case study now. The fact that we are still number one having spent half the time doing other sports shows the truth of that study in Belgium. You can be effective with less hours and use the rest of the time to develop your 'football' athletic ability."" Catch the action for only £25 a month with this limited time offer. Watch the Premier League, Formula 1, PGA Tour and much more. Cancel any time. Indeed, it is fascinating to think that there is now a generation of talent emerging at Ajax, including members of the squad that so wowed Europe in reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League in 2019, who were developed in line with Wormhoudt's ideas. ""I got a lot of satisfaction from that. I am very cautious about saying it is my influence. I cannot say that. It would be impossible to claim that. I will just wait for people to wake up."" In the meantime, Wormhoudt is expanding his vision far beyond elite sport. He has created the Athletic Skills Model and the Skills Garden, a solution for public spaces. In effect, these are super playgrounds designed to optimise the learning experience while making children more healthy. ""Kids used to play outside,"" he explains. ""They would climb and they would play fight. That is gone now. So we need to fill in that development. That was my idea at Ajax. ""But the advantages of a diversified background, a background that makes it possible for you to become a footballer, also has a lot of health advantages. They can apply to anyone. Less injury. A healthier lifestyle. Less drop outs, more creativity and a longer athletic life. It is a much bigger idea."" Naturally, he has incorporated his beliefs about the need for a variety of skills to develop the all-round athlete into the Skills Garden. ""I have implemented it in the design,"" he adds. ""I put a lot of asymmetric parts because it develops our creativity. When we were kids, we played around lampposts and cars. But when the adults came in, it all became symmetric so we lost that creativity and because we don't play outside it has a double effect. ""I am still developing and innovating. It is about building a better world."" As for Van de Beek, he has some adapting to do for himself as he makes the adjustment to a new life in the Premier League. Fortunately, he has had some help in that respect. ""He needs to adapt quickly to a new situation and a new intensity of playing. Not only the matches but also in the training. I hear players talk about the Premier League and say that it is much more intense than the Dutch league so it will be interesting. How will he adapt? I hope that I taught him a lot about adaptation."" There is even time for one more anecdote to illustrate the point. ""It is funny,"" adds Wormhoudt. ""I spoke to Jari Litmanen about ice-hockey training. I asked him what he learned from that. He said that he learned how to make decisions quickly, but the other thing he learned was not to get into the duels. That is a kind of adaptation. ""I hope that Donny can take that with him because he is less the man for the duels. He needs to be thinking faster and acting faster than the rest. If that is going to happen quickly then Manchester United are going to have a lot of fun with him."" You read correctly. Do not miss your chance to scoop £1m for free in this week's Super 6 round.

After only previously signing Donny van de Beek during the summer transfer window, United completed four signings in the 24 hours that followed their 6-1 mauling at home to Tottenham even though Jadon Sancho, who United have chased all summer, remained at Dortmund and an enquiry to Watford for winger Ismaila Sarr didn't progress. Instead United recruited left-back Alex Telles for a fee of £15.4m, brought in 18-year-old Pellistri and signed Atlanta winger Amad Diallo, in a deal that could be worth up to £37.2m. The 18-year-old, who has only played 24 minutes in Serie A, will join the club in January. Cavani, 33, has signed a one-year contract with the option of a further 12 months and is expected to wear the club's iconic number seven shirt. ""Clearly Edinson Cavani has the work-ethic, the hunger to be a success at Manchester United,"" reported Sky Sports News' James Cooper. ""He's been impressed by the project he's been offered by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and in return Solskjaer has been impressed by Cavani. ""Solskjaer has said he will score goals. He won't sit on the bench and he is someone who will deliver something they haven't got with their other striking options.

""Now, all of a sudden Cavani comes in. He'll hold the ball up, but for me it's a panic. I hope I'm wrong but it's not a future signing and it's not one that tells me they're moving forward. ""It's not one that tells me that in three or four years they're going to catch up with Liverpool and Man City. This is not going to catch those two clubs up now."" How do you explain 'Silly Sunday?' - Listen to the latest Pitch to Post Podcast on Apple | Spotify But it was not one-way traffic at Old Trafford on Deadline Day, with Chris Smalling the club's highest-profile departure. The defender has joined Roma in an £18m deal. Smalling, who has signed a three-year deal at the Serie A club with the option of an additional year, had been pushing for a move back to Rome throughout the summer, where he impressed last year on a season-long loan. But should United have let him depart?

Sky News has learnt Steve Pagliuca is in talks with a string of potential co-investors ahead of a deadline for final bids for the Premier League club next Monday. Sources said Iger, who stepped down as Disney's executive chairman in December, was among those who had been sounded out by Pagliuca since he became one of the four bidders shortlisted to buy Chelsea. The level of any financial commitment from Iger was unclear on Tuesday, and one source said it was possible he had decided not to become involved in the auction of the Stamford Bridge club. If he does back Pagliuca, however, it would add one of the most prominent names in America's entertainment industry to the list of potential investors in last season's Champions League winners. The quartet of remaining bidders are holding meetings in London this week with Chelsea board members, staff and the club's advisers at Raine Group. On the pitch, the coming days will be significant in determining the outcome of the Blues' season, with the first leg of a Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid taking place on Wednesday. Chelsea fixtures Latest Chelsea news Premier League table Get Sky Sports The Chelsea Supporters' Trust issued a statement saying it had yet to be contacted by Pagliuca with just a week to go before the final bid deadline. Earlier this week, the consortium led by the Chicago Cubs-owning Ricketts family and including Cleveland Cavaliers-owner Dan Gilbert and hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin outlined a series of commitments to Blues fans, including a vow never to participate in a revived European Super League project. Other bidders are understood to have submitted details of commitments to the CST but have chosen not to make them public so far. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Pagliuca's spokeswoman did not respond to emailed requests for comment, while Disney said it could not contact Iger. A near-50 year veteran of Disney, Iger stepped down having overseen the acquisitions of Marvel Studios and Pixar during his tenure. His wealth was estimated by Forbes magazine at close to $800m in 2020, meaning he would be a shareholder in any bid for Chelsea if he did become involved. Iger is not the only former Disney chief to be linked to an English football club takeover. His predecessor, Michael Eisner, bought Portsmouth FC in 2017 for a tiny fraction of the price tag that Chelsea will command later this month when a preferred bid is proposed to the government. The Ricketts-led bid for Chelsea has faced challenges in recent weeks because of a backlash over historical comments made by a family member who is not involved in the offer. An anti-Ricketts protest before Chelsea's game against Brentford on Saturday, which the visitors won 4-1, attracted roughly 100 fans, according to reports. After meeting supporters' groups last month, the Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts said the bid team had ""listened to all of your feedback - including from the Chelsea Supporters' Trust - and are grateful that the door is still open for us to demonstrate our commitment to working with fans to protect the club's heritage"". ""It is now up to us to redouble our efforts and clearly lay out a vision for our stewardship of the club with diversity and inclusion at its heart."" Supporters of their offer have pointed to the family's successful ownership of the Cubs, having won the World Series for the first time in a century and completed a $1bn renovation of its home, Wrigley Field - one of the most historic sports arenas in the US. People close to the consortium confirmed it would be an all-equity bid, with no new debt being placed onto Chelsea's balance sheet. The other remaining bidders for Chelsea are a consortium fronted by the former Liverpool FC chairman Sir Martin Broughton, whose bid is partly financed by the Crystal Palace shareholders Josh Harris and Dave Blitzer; and an offer from the LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly, who is working with Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss. Sky News revealed last week the fan-led group co-founded by the former Chelsea captain John Terry was in ""positive"" talks with two of the shortlisted bidders about acquiring a 10 per cent stake. Raine is aiming to present a preferred bid to the government during the week of April 18, paving the way for a sale to take place before the end of the month. Between them, the final bidders also either control or own stakes in US teams including the Boston Celtics, the Cubs, the LA Dodgers, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Sacramento Kings. By the standards of conventional takeover processes, the Chelsea auction has moved at breakneck speed, with executives at other major investment banks suggesting that such a complex sale would typically have taken at least six months. Mr Abramovich's sanctioning by the UK Government has added further complications to the transaction, as bidders have sought clarity on the legal implications of buying the club. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Prior to being sanctioned, Abramovich had said he intended to write off a £1.5bn loan to the club and hand the net proceeds from the sale to a new charity that he would set up to benefit the victims of the war in Ukraine. A rapid sale is seen as essential if Chelsea is to avert the uncertainty that would trigger the break-up of one of the top flight's most valuable playing squads. The current FIFA Club World Cup winners have been thrown into disarray by Russia's war on Ukraine, with Abramovich initially proposing to place the club in the care of its foundation and then formally putting it up for sale. Abramovich had initially slapped a £3bn price tag on the Stamford Bridge outfit, with the net proceeds being donated to a charitable foundation set up to benefit the victims of the war in Ukraine. As well as government consent in the form of a special licence, Chelsea's new owners will also require the approval of the Premier League under its fit and proper ownership test.

""I'm pretty sure he's got my phone number!"" the Manchester United interim manager tells Sky Sports, standing within the inner confines of a silent Old Trafford late on Thursday evening. ""He's got another couple of games to play with Ajax, we have another three games to play here. Whenever he wants to speak with me and exchange our opinions, I'm more than happy to do that."" Erik ten Hag was appointed more than a week ago as the man to drive United into a new era, one where they're expected to be back challenging for the Premier League title and major trophies, and one which is still to even make the first tentative steps. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It is scarcely believable that nearly 10 years and four permanent managers have passed since Sir Alex Ferguson announced his retirement - the last time United were English football's top dogs. Right now, they are further away than ever from experiencing the same past glories - set to finish this season with their lowest-ever Premier League points total. But Rangnick, despite admitting the club needs ""open heart surgery"", is upbeat the process to get back to the summit might not take long, providing the right changes are made. ""Knowing Erik will be the manager, with a good recruitment process and bringing in the right players, I'm very positive the supporters and the media will be able to see a better team and, at the end, hopefully a better position in the league,"" he said. Man Utd fixtures Premier League table Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments ""There are quite a few good examples in the league with when Jurgen Klopp came to Liverpool, Pep Guardiola to Manchester City, Thomas Tuchel came to Chelsea - yes, he came in the middle of the season and inherited a top-quality squad, but you still need to win the Champions League. ""If you know what you're looking for, the profiles of the different positions you need, it shouldn't hopefully take too long."" That is where Rangnick will lend his expertise during his two-year consultancy role while managing the Austria national team. The 63-year-old was not prepared to discuss his new job or how both would be combined going forwards - and would neither offer an opinion on whether Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored eight of the team's last 9 league goals, could fit into Ten Hag's demanding style of play. ""This is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag,"" he said, after Ronaldo rescued United again on Thursday night by scoring the equaliser in their 1-1 with Chelsea. ""He's showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it's obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, it's pretty obvious."" Rangnick wants United to find and develop ""future top, star players"" who can be moulded into the club's ways rather than buying a player who is already the finished product, as they have been keen to do in recent years. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The interim boss believes combining that approach with consistent recruitment at each opportunity can, again, move United closer to the country's top teams. ""If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window,"" he said. ""They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. ""I wouldn't be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks. This shows it is possible that this can happen and it would not necessarily need three, four years in order to do that."" Ironically, United face Brentford on Monday Night Football, live on Sky Sports, a club renowned for their work in the transfer market. The Bees have reached the top-flight with their Moneyball-style use of data to drive their player recruitment - making only four signings last summer to help comfortably keep them in the Premier League for a second season. Rangnick rightly points out the difference in size between United and Brentford, which has to be taken into consideration when the two are signing players and their approach to it, but agrees every club needs to follow an 'idea'. ""No matter which club, it is always necessary and important that you need an idea,"" he said. ""You need to know how you want to play, what kind of profiles do we need because if you do not do that, you're always looking for the needle in the haystack. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""This is what I meant when I said 'open heart surgery'. I don't think it's enough to do some minor corrections and amendments. I think it's important to see the big picture and then hopefully bring in the best possible players. ""They should also fit together, this is also an issue, it is not only about bringing some players for defence, midfield and up front, it's also important you get to know the personality of the players and that they really fit and are able to meet the standards of this big club."" In the meantime, as United prepare to play their final home game of the season, Rangnick will keep on waiting to share his ideas with the man responsible for rebuilding United.

""His culture of working, his professionalism, his mentality..."" These are all qualities Manchester United right-back Diogo Dalot used to describe what he has been able to take from training and being around Cristiano Ronaldo, the evergreen goal-scoring machine. The two knew each other before Ronaldo made his return to Old Trafford last summer due to playing together for Portugal. But Dalot describes what it is like to train with Ronaldo on a more consistent basis. ""I'm sure I speak not just for me but he's been one of the most positive things about this season - to work with somebody who has his culture of working, his professionalism, his mentality and being close to him now... it's been very helpful for me and my career,"" Dalot tells Sky Sports News. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""I don't have any more compliments to give about the way he works, he's a fantastic human being as well. ""The numbers are there, the stats are there, so we're obviously very happy to have him here."" Get NOW to stream big moments Get Sky Sports Man Utd fixtures Premier League table Ronaldo has undoubtedly been a shining light on the field for United - netting 17 times in the Premier League season - but what is he like off the pitch? ""He's a very friendly person. When he feels he has the trust of other people, he gives 100 per cent of himself to you,"" Dalot said. ""Everybody gets along with him here, everyone likes to have him around. It's always a big plus to have a player and a person like this in the changing room."" Once United's season ends, all eyes will be swiftly looking forward to the next when Ajax manager Erik ten Hag takes the reins at Old Trafford. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Asked if he has researched the incoming boss at United, Dalot said: ""I don't think you need to see a lot to know that he is a great manager - what he's done with Ajax is something outstanding. ""He plays very attractive football, I think every fan of United is excited to have a manager like this, and we as the players are as well. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""In our heads, it's going to be clear who the manager will be next season and that's good because we go for our break in our heads knowing who to expect. ""Then we will have time in pre-season to work together, get our ideas right and start the new season."" After arriving as a 19-year-old under Jose Mourinho in 2018, Dalot has had to bide his time before fully breaking into the starting 11 at United. Dalot spent last season on-loan at AC Milan, making 33 appearances, and off the back of that is now experiencing his best season at United in terms of playing time - making 21 appearances so far. Having forced his way into the first team - it is clear for Dalot that next season will be vital for club and country alike. ""It's difficult to say it's been a good season when the results are not quite there as we expected, but individually it's been good in terms of playing much more,"" Dalot said. ""Playing regularly has been one of my biggest desires since I came here and I've fought very hard to get it. ""It's been good with more minutes than other seasons so I'm very happy with that, but obviously I want to combine that with team performances, with trophies and that's the aim for the next seasons. ""I like to see it season by season. This season has been special because I've played more regularly here, getting into the first team with the national team and we qualified for the World Cup. ""I want to be there so these are the aims, but we still have three games to play, national team games at the end of the season, so there's no point looking too much ahead when we have some goals to achieve at the end of the season.""

Signing a new central midfielder is one of the club's priorities in the upcoming window, and they are very interested in the 25-year-old. However, Wolves value the Portugal international at between £50m and £60m - and the Gunners face stiff competition from other clubs. Chief among those is Barcelona, who have considerable interest in him too, despite doubts over their financial clout in the next market. Manchester United and Tottenham have also been interested in Neves this season, although Spurs signed midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur in January and United's transfer plans are yet to be finalised considering they have not yet appointed a new permanent manager. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It means Arsenal are encouraged to pursue a deal for Neves after they were unable to sign a new central midfielder in January, having then made a considerable effort to strike a loan deal with Juventus for Arthur Melo.

Wolves head coach Bruno Lage suggested last week a deal for the Portugal international would cost £100m - the same amount Man City spent to break the British transfer record to buy Jack Grealish last summer.

The Ajax boss was named as United's new manager on Thursday and will take up the role from interim head coach Ralf Rangnick in the summer. Sixth-placed United are currently reeling from a 4-0 defeat at Liverpool, and Neville says Ten Hag has a lot of groundwork to do before he and his team will be able to compete with the likes of Jurgen Klopp's side for major honours. ""What we're seeing at this current moment is unacceptable,"" said Neville. ""That needs to be dealt with initially and Ten Hag has got a big job to get the club back up to those minimum standards that they need to achieve, which is attitude, work ethic, belief, confidence and then hopefully you start to think about winning trophies. ""But honestly, I wouldn't be putting too much pressure on Ten Hag in the first one or two years to win a trophy at the club. It would be great if he did and he'd be overachieving, in my opinion. ""It will be: get into the top four, re-establish Man Utd in the Champions League, attract the players into the club who can play in the way he wants to play, and then get a system of belief. ""It took Jurgen Klopp four or five years to win a Premier League title, as great a job as he's done. I wouldn't be putting pressure on Ten Hag in the first two or three years to win a Premier League title. They're a million miles away from that currently.

""At the end of last season, I thought they were getting closer. But it's all collapsed and fallen to pieces. I don't know why that's happened. Ten Hag gets to pick up the pieces. ""So initial phase: build the foundations of what he wants to achieve then year three, four, five is when you start looking at him to win trophies."" Liverpool's big win on Tuesday followed the 5-0 drubbing they dished out at Old Trafford in October, and United have also suffered comprehensive defeats to Premier League leaders Manchester City this term. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Neville believes the impact of those results and United's wretched run of form which has seen them win just four of their last 14 matches could affect the trajectory of players' careers - and Ten Hag may have to take that into account when he assesses who from the current squad he wants to bring with him on the journey. ""The players have completely lost their confidence and belief,"" said Neville. ""They don't want to play football for Manchester United at this moment in time. That's not they don't want to play football for the club - they don't want to play football. They want the season to finish. ""You can see it in their eyes when they warm up, when they walk out, when they're playing. They just want these games over. But the problem is there is no hiding place at this club. They've got Arsenal Saturday, Chelsea next Thursday where all the eyes are still going to be on them and they're going to have to try to turn up. They've got to find something from somewhere. ""I want to be careful in saying there's long-lasting damage but the mental impact of what's happening at the club in this moment in time, with the types of defeats they're suffering, the type of criticism they're getting, the fans booing them, that's going to have long-lasting impact on some of those lads to the point where Ten Hag will have to make a decision whether he can recover it - and with some of them he may not be able to. It's getting that bad. ""There's a big job to do in many different aspects. The first job is to decide who he wants to keep that's currently there and then he's got to decide who he wants to get in with him to make sure that confidence, that belief, that spirit in the dressing room can start to rise."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Recruitment is going to be a key focus, with Rangnick saying after the Anfield defeat United may need as many as 10 new players. But deciding who leaves the club to make way for those new recruits will also be important, with Sky Sports News understanding Ten Hag will tell United players he doesn't want any passengers at the club. Neville expects interim boss Rangnick, who has seen the current squad up close and personal, to have strong views on who should stay and who should go. ""Recruitment is the most important job in a football club,"" he said. ""If you get the players wrong, you're struggling. ""Man Utd have repeatedly flip-flopped over a 10 year period to different philosophies. There have been moments that I believed they were on the right track but how it's unravelled in the last 8-10 months, from being in a Europa League final to where it is now is alarming. ""I can't explain it. I don't think any Man Utd fan can explain it, or probably anyone inside the club can explain why it's gone from a level which wasn't at the very top but certainly going in the right direction, to a point where that dressing room looks broken in spirit, in energy, in belief in each other, in likeability of each other as a group. ""Rangnick has had four or five months to assess that dressing room. I'm pretty certain they'll be having pretty direct conversations about who he needs to get rid of. ""It's on the tip of Rangnick's tongue in every single interview he does and you feel like he's going to go rogue at some point and start calling players out. He's doing it in groups, he's not doing it individuals yet, but there's no doubt Rangnick will be passing on that very specific information about who Ten Hag needs to get rid of - and I'm sure Ten Hag will listen and buy into that.""

The top-four rivals looked set to play out a drab goalless draw on Saturday afternoon as former United boss David Moyes’ well-drilled side produced a solid performance at Old Trafford. West Ham had already won there this season in the Carabao Cup but this time United emerged victorious as Rangnick threw caution to the wind, bringing on Anthony Martial, Edinson Cavani and Rashford. All three were involved in the third and final minute of stoppage time, with the latter turning home in front of the Stretford End to seal a 1-0 win that rocked Old Trafford to its foundations. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player “If I look at the shots on goal and the chances during the game, I think we deserved a 1-0 win,” Rangnick said. “For me, it was clear from the very beginning it would take some patience against a well-organised team like West Ham. It was not always easy for us to find the best possible solutions in the final third. “Defensively I think it was probably the best performance in the last eight weeks, the way that we were always trying to win balls back, our counter-pressing.

Was that the last five minutes? How long? I wouldn’t mind if that happened! “But, again, of course we would also like to have more games like Brentford at the end when we were 3-0 up. “But if you score with the last seconds of the game, the big advantage is there is no time for the team to reply and that was a good one about the goal.” The late goal meant Rangnick oversaw back-to-back wins for the first time in charge, with United usurping West Ham in fourth. “I also enjoyed the other wins, also the win at Brentford, which was as important as the win today, but this was an extremely emotional game,” he said. “An extremely emotional moment if you score in the last second of the game, knowing that there is no time anymore for the other team to reply. “It was extremely emotional, I can only say thank you to the red army. The way that they supported the team all through the game – they pushed us and carried us through the game. It was amazing. “Since I have arrived, in home games it was by far the best atmosphere in the stadium.” The winner was also special for Rashford, who has responded to recent criticism of his poor displays with goals against Brentford and West Ham. “He’s one of the top strikers in England,” the interim boss said. “He’s an English international, who regularly played in the Euros and we all know what quality he has. “He has almost everything a modern striker needs. He’s got the pace, skills, he’s got the size and physicality of a striker and in the end it’s all about confidence for strikers. “I’m pretty sure that those two goals have raised the level of confidence within Marcus but now it’s about taking steps, to show that on a regular basis. “It’s about continuity now and I think he can play a very important role for the rest of the season for us.” Marcus Rashford was delighted with his match-winning moment in front of the Stretford End. ""Very happy today and a very big game against an opponent who are very tight with us at the moment, so it was very important that we got the win,"" he said. ""You might not see it now but, come the end of the season, three points can be the difference between being in or out of the top four. ""I'm pleased we managed to get them today and we have to use that as motivation."" Rashford has now scored twice in two games having failed to find the net in his previous 11 appearances in all competitions. ""I think, for any forward, when you go through a patch of not scoring for a few games, it's a great feeling when the goals do start coming back,"" he added. ""We just have to keep moving forward now and keep going in the right direction."" Sky Sports' Nick Wright: After a run of 11 games without scoring, and with his form under intense scrutiny, Marcus Rashford followed up his late strike against Brentford on Wednesday night with a crucial winner in the final minute of stoppage time against West Ham. Ralf Rangnick's side were seemingly heading for a goalless draw having failed to break West Ham down but, with only seconds remaining at Old Trafford, Rashford rushed in at the far post to convert Edinson Cavani's low cross. The goal propelled Manchester United above West Ham and into the top four, and it may prove just as significant for Rashford. How he needed this. Rashford scored three times in his first four appearances of the campaign after returning from injury in October but the subsequent months brought nothing but frustration, his poor form eventually prompting Ralf Rangnick to use teenager Anthony Elanga instead. Rashford is not the only one to have struggled to hold down a place in United's attack, of course. The same is true of Anthony Martial and Jadon Sancho. But with two goals in four days, he may just have reignited his own season as well as United's top-four bid. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  As for West Ham counterpart Moyes, his frustration came across clearly in a short response to the first question of the press conference. “P***** off with that result, that’s for sure,” he said. It was a missed opportunity for the Hammers, who only made one substitution and came close to snatching a winner before the hosts did. A number of West Ham fans clashed with police in riot gear at Old Trafford after their 1-0 defeat to Manchester United.   Two supporters were seen spitting towards the officers as tempers flared in the away end following the game.   Sky Sports News has contacted Greater Manchester Police and West Ham for comment.   West Ham are investigating the reports of trouble after the game. “You have to know how to see games out,” Moyes said. “Let’s be fair, people who watch West Ham regularly will see that we’ve had games where it has been a problem. “We’ve been winning games 3-0 and it’s ended up 3-2, or had games like that, so it’s something that we need to do much better.” Sky Sports’ Paul Merson:   “I thought West Ham should have gone into the transfer market at the start of January. Things looked a bit rosier at the start of the month. They looked like they had a really good chance of getting into the top four and I thought they might invest then.   “It’s a big gamble to invest now because there are so many teams in and around them. They can go and spend £60m to £70m in the next week and they could still finish eighth. That’s how tight it is.   “There are too many big teams with games in hand on them now and if they invest, who are they going to get. I think I’d have to leave it as it is now, if I was West Ham.” Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6. Play for free, entries by 3pm. ",positive

But that is a job that he has done before. At Ajax, they mocked his accent. He was a Tukker - a man from the east of the country, a region known for a down-to-earth approach. There were those in sophisticated Amsterdam who did not believe the great Ajax had anything to learn from him. They were wrong. Two domestic doubles and one kick away from a Champions League final later and there is an acceptance Ten Hag has brought some of the best football that Ajax has seen in years. His methods have delivered success, his manner has won over the doubters. The ascent to perhaps the biggest job in football might feel swift but his progress has been steady, methodically planned to maximise his skill-set. At 52, he has been a youth coach and a head of education, an assistant at home and abroad, and a manager at various levels. In a series of interviews with former team-mates, those who played with him as a teenager and were later captained by him, with players who he led to promotion in his first head coaching role, a picture emerges of an original thinker, a motivator and a disciplinarian. This is the making of Erik ten Hag. Raised in north Haaksbergen, a small town not far from the city of Enschede, life was idyllic in those early years. Jumpers for goalposts, football until dark. Ten Hag was good enough at it to shine when playing for Bon Boys, the local club where he is still a member. Get Sky Sports Transfer Centre LIVE! Premier League table Man Utd fixtures Leon ten Voorde, a childhood friend turned journalist remembers a cheerful boy and a rebellious teenager, not the strict disciplinarian obsessed with detail. But Ten Hag was captain of Bon Boys, nevertheless. Leadership was in his genes, according to Ten Voorde. Boudewijn Pahlplatz recalls it the same way. When Ten Hag was picked up by FC Twente, the biggest club in the region, Pahlplatz played alongside him for the youth team, the reserves and eventually the first team, across two different spells at Twente. ""After that, we even worked together when he was the head of education and I was a coach,"" Pahlplatz tells Sky Sports. They last spoke in the summer at a reunion to mark 20 years since Twente won the KNVB Cup for only the second time in their history. ""When I came back to Twente, I was not really fit any more because I had some problems with my muscles and Erik was the captain. He was an average player, but he was a good team player. Even when he was playing, he was already a coach, always knowing better."" In a team that included Netherlands international Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and those such as Pahlplatz who had enjoyed greater success at PSV Eindhoven, not everyone appreciated this central defender who was barking orders at them from the back. ""That was not always popular with the players because he was not the best player. When you are not the best player, it is hard for the better players to accept it. But he was thinking like a coach and the truth is that he always had the best tactical thoughts. ""Twenty years on, you can see that he was right all along."" The playing journey with Twente that had begun when they were teenagers ended for Pahlplatz and Ten Hag in 2002, but the latter moved seamlessly into a coaching role with the U17 side. He did that for a season before assuming control of the U19 group. There were early signs of his dedication. Wout Brama, now back at Twente but then an academy player, recalls wondering what they were up against when Ten Hag's first decision was to cut their holiday short by two weeks. Impact was quick. Progress was steady. ""He built his career very carefully,"" says Pahlplatz. 2002-2003: Twente U17 coach  2003-2006: Twente U19 coach  2006-2009: Twente assistant manager  2009-2012: PSV Eindhoven assistant manager  2012-2013: Go Ahead Eagles manager  2013-2015: Bayern Munich II manager  2015-2017: Utrecht manager  2017-2022: Ajax manager Ten Hag was later an assistant under Fred Rutten, then Steve McClaren, before following Rutten to PSV for three seasons. It was in the summer of 2012, aged 42 and after a decade of coaching, that he took his first head coaching job with Go Ahead Eagles. ""It has been step by step, developing his own philosophy and his own way of playing. That is very good. These days you see too many old players who immediately want to run a first team. That is very hard. You have to be so good that it is only for some players."" The opportunity at Eagles was not an obvious one. This was a club that had been relegated from the Eredivisie in 1996 and stayed in the second tier for the subsequent 16 seasons. Standards had slipped, expectations had dipped. Ten Hag soon changed that. Sjoerd Overgoor was not optimistic when he found out Ten Hag would be his new head coach. The young midfielder was trying to make his way in the game after being released by Twente as a teenager. One of the men responsible for that decision? Ten Hag. ""He had been the head of the youth academy at Twente when I was sent away and told that I was not good enough,"" Overgoor tells Sky Sports. ""I had a contract at Go Ahead Eagles so you can imagine how I felt when it was announced. But it went completely differently."" At the end of that season, there were celebrations on the pitch and in the stands as the club's 17-year wait to play in the Eredivisie would soon be at an end. Nobody there was in any doubt about the identity of the man who had been the main factor in that success. ""It was the most special day of my career,"" says Overgoor. ""I am not a great player, but because of Erik ten Hag I played in the highest division. He is the best coach that I have ever had. He was the reason. You don't see coaches that good in the second division."" Bart Vriends was part of the Eagles team, arriving on loan from Utrecht that winter to strengthen the defence. That season is fresh in his mind because he has been working on a documentary about it, the central figure interviewing team-mates - and Ten Hag. Every player tells him the same thing. ""What really came out from those conversations with everyone involved was that Erik ten Hag changed the professionalism at the club in just a couple of weeks at the start of pre-season,"" Vriends tells Sky Sports. ""This was a small mid-table second division club in a small city in the east. It grew into something else when he was in charge. He changed the mentality in the club. He changed the mentality of the players and the people who worked there. From day one, actually."" Ten Hag is fastidious. One of the first things he noticed was that the woman in charge of the kits at the club would bring out drinks and set them out on the table inside the dressing room. ""She would put the drinks there just randomly,"" says Vriends. This was a problem for Ten Hag. ""He wanted the drinks put out in straight lines. Everything had to be perfect in his eyes. People needed time to get used to that."" There are so many stories like this. ""We had one man whose job it was to look after the pitch,"" says Overgoor. ""Every day Erik would be coming to him and saying that the grass had to be two millimetres or something like that. That was a big difference for everyone at the club. He changed everything. ""Remember, this is not a big club in Holland. We did not have the best facilities but he made them the best. A lot of coaches come to clubs like Eagles and have the attitude that they have to deal with it. He did not deal with it. Instead, he made it better and better."" Detail was everything, as Overgoor found out in pre-season. ""We did a lot of ball work, but a few times in the afternoon we would have to run in the woods in groups. He would say that we had to run a certain distance in two minutes. We wanted to prove ourselves to him so our group did it in one minute and 50 seconds. ""He said, 'No. If I tell you to run for two minutes I don't want you to take two minutes and 10 seconds but I also don't want you to run for one minute and 50 seconds. Two minutes is two minutes. He was like that. If you did not stick to the plan you had a problem."" Some of the stories about Ten Hag make him sound like a tough taskmaster, but there was another side to his coaching. He was an innovator intent on raising standards. That meant placing demands on players, but also providing them with a better environment. Vriends had arrived from Utrecht. ""A bigger and more fashionable club back then."" But the attention to detail was still a surprise to him. ""He put beds in the dressing room so we could rest and sleep in between the two training sessions. That was really new at that time."" Video analysis helped take things to another level. ""It was the first time that I had experienced that. Remember, this was 10 years ago at Go Ahead Eagles. After matches, we would go to his room individually and be shown our clips. He was never satisfied."" One seemingly trivial example is cited by both of his former players, clearly leaving an impression. ""He put a window in his office door,"" remembers Overgoor. ""We were all saying to each other that he was doing that so he could see what we were doing."" Ten Hag later revealed the real reason. ""He said, 'No, if the door is closed and there is no window it is difficult to come in because maybe I am busy and people will not want to knock. Now people will see if I am free and that makes it easier to come in.' These were the details that he thought about. ""That was really impressive to me. It was something I had not seen before."" Vriends agrees. ""He had put this big glass window in just so that it made things more transparent, helping with communication. It is a little example of how he changed the thinking."" Ten Hag had to do more than change the thinking, he had to change the results. That process also began in pre-season but took rather longer to perfect. Before the wins started to come, there were hours and hours of work put in on the training ground. ""We played a lot of 11 against zero,"" recalls Overgoor. The team would line up as they would for a game but with no opposition in place, practising how they intended to move the ball around the pitch. It is a favourite of coaches but not too much fun for the players. ""Every time we would start with the goalkeeper and he would talk us through the patterns of how we could attack. He wanted diagonal balls. Every time that we played a straight ball he would stop us and make us do it again. He was very strict in terms of what he wanted. ""After four weeks of 11 against zero we were thinking, 'What is this? It is so boring.' But after a couple of months of the season, there were matches where we knew what we had to do and everyone was seeing it the same way. It was really clear and it was working."" By the time that Vriends arrived in January, Ten Hag had established his idea and the mood had changed. ""There were really interesting coaching sessions,"" he says. Overgoor agrees. ""We became confident in our style of play and it became better and better."" That style was 4-3-3. ""Like at Ajax,"" adds Overgoor. ""Sometimes he made changes at half-time but nothing weird. Maybe one midfielder had to come 10 metres deeper to gain more ball possession. That is his big quality. He knows how to change it to become better."" Perhaps influenced by having been released at Twente, Overgoor thought Ten Hag had a problem with him at first. ""He would shout at me,"" he recalls. ""I thought that he did not like me. Other players recognise it too and they said the same thing to me."" It took a conversation to clear the air. ""I asked him what I was doing wrong because he was always shouting at me. He told me that I was the sort of guy who was happy with 90 per cent but if I was angry I could give even more and would improve. ""Once he told me that, I knew that when he shouted he just wanted more. I had been negative but it turned into a positive. He believed in me but felt I had more to give."" Man-management was usually reserved for football matters. ""A lot of the time it is only about football, not about family or something else. Every day he wanted to talk about football and improve, improve, improve. But he knew what every player needed and that is a good thing to have as a coach."" Vriends remembers it the same way. ""I have not seen him a lot with a relaxed kind of vibe, up for a laugh or a chilled training session. He is always really serious. But I guess that is just the standard of top-level football. It took us a while to get into that. But it worked."" Harsh but fair is a mantra that wins respect in the dressing room. ""Every single player in that squad, even the ones on the bench, were really happy with him actually,"" adds Vriends. Pahlplatz also notes that ability to unite a squad. At Ajax, a club that has had its divisions in the past, the atmosphere among the group has rarely been a problem. ""He was always good with players. He always protects them. He can be hard with players but players are always very positive about him - even players who don't play or players who leave to go to another club. They all say he is a good coach and a good person."" Following promotion with Go Ahead Eagles, there was some frustration Ten Hag decided not to continue the journey with them in the Eredivisie and instead moved to Bayern Munich, taking their reserve team while Pep Guardiola coached the seniors. ""I was surprised and a little bit disappointed because I knew he would make me a better player,"" says Overgoor. ""But he was too good for us so it was normal that he would leave. It is the same with players. If they are too good, they leave. He was too good to stay. ""We were lucky because in the first year of the Eredivisie we had nine of the same 11 players, so in that first year without him we played exactly how Erik wanted us to play. That is why we stayed in the highest division that year, I think."" There is less surprise at the success that Ten Hag has enjoyed since. ""I knew he had it in him. We knew he was special. He went to Bayern Munich and then to Utrecht."" Vriends even played a part in him moving there. ""I remember the board at Utrecht contacted me because they wanted some information about this guy who they wanted as their new head coach. I was only positive about it. They took him and it was a massive success. It did not surprise me at all. ""I guess I should have been paid for that. I would be rich."" Ten Hag has had to evolve since those Go Ahead Eagles days. At Utrecht, he moved away from his 4-3-3 formation to utilise two strikers instead. It worked again. They finished fifth in his first season and fourth in his second - taking the club into Europe. ""I think he just adapts to the players that he has,"" says Vriends. ""We had wingers on the sides and played an attacking, dominant, passing game. At Utrecht, he changed formation to suit the players that he had. He did not really stick to this Dutch style of football."" At Ajax, he did return to that 4-3-3 formation but put his own twist on things - on and off the pitch. He had to convince a club, one with a very clear philosophy about how things should be done, that he had ideas of his own. It took time but that is what he did. ""At the beginning there too, people needed to get used to him,"" says Vriends. ""He was this serious man from the east of the country with this funny accent. It did not really seem to fit with Ajax at first. But within weeks it was all good. He changed the mentality. ""I think he actually changed the standards at the club."" A recurring theme of Ten Hag's career has been proving people wrong. That will be a challenge at Manchester United for various reasons. Patience is a virtue but the Premier League is full of sinners. Will he be given the time? Even his admirers doubt that. ""If you have a board who do not have patience it could be done after a few months,"" says Overgoor. ""But the board trusted him at Utrecht and at Ajax and you see what happens next. It was the same at Eagles. It was up and down. After that, it was up, up and up. ""At Ajax, they had the patience. I don't know if Manchester United has that patience if the results do not come in the first few months because there is so much more going on. If he is given the time he will do the job. He has shown everywhere that he is good enough."" Those training-ground methods might be an issue, says Pahlplatz. ""He does a lot of repetition. That was almost a problem for him in the beginning at Utrecht and Ajax. He trained them very hard and very long to get his philosophy into the players. That takes hours. The Utrecht and Ajax players were not used to that. ""He brought a new philosophy and that was a struggle for him at first. He demands so much of the players. Afterwards, you can see that it pays off. At the beginning, to convince players of his ideas is difficult. But you see how he has Ajax playing now, it is unbelievable."" Overgoor does not expect those 11 versus zero sessions to be repeated. ""He had to do it with us because we were not as good and needed some patterns to build on. He does not make Dusan Tadic and Daley Blind do 11 versus zero, they have more freedom. ""I don't think he will be telling Cristiano Ronaldo what to do."" That thought is a reminder that Manchester United is different. Pahlplatz remembers his conversations with McClaren at Twente. ""He used to tell us how it was with the media there. It is 24 hours a day at Manchester United. It is something you have to get used to. ""There are only a few Dutch coaches who have been at the biggest clubs in the world like Manchester United. Louis van Gaal was there, Leo Beenhakker and Guus Hiddink at Real Madrid, Johan Cruyff and Ronald Koeman at Barcelona. This is the level we are talking. ""He knows German football. He knows Dutch football. How will he cope with English football and all that comes with it? ""That is the interesting question. Will he deal with it?"" Pros:  Attractive football that players understand  Tactically smart  Not afraid to push young talent  Good relationship with players   Cons:  Does not love the limelight  Man Utd is a commercially huge club  Will he stick to 4-3-3? Premier League demands flexibility Fresh from spending an hour with Ten Hag reminiscing about their time together at Go Ahead Eagles, Vriends is convinced his old boss will adapt, just as he has to every previous challenge. ""I sound like his agent but I think this is a really wise choice by Manchester United to go for him. It seems like a tough club to manage but I do think it is a wise decision. ""His success has not surprised me at all. He is still the best manager that I have seen in my career and he has taken every step since then. For me, that season together was huge. One to remember. For him, it was just the beginning of his coaching career."" It was the making of Erik ten Hag. Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

Fulham's players knelt ahead of the Championship match, while Millwall's chose to stand ahead of kick-off - some with a fist in the air as a show of solidarity. Boos were heard while the players performed the gesture and Rowett believes football's authorities need to find a ""more positive way"" of tackling the issue of racism and discrimination. ""If you look up and down the country, there are so many football clubs that do such good work in their communities around equality and anti-racism,"" Rowett said after the match, which ended in a 2-1 win for Fulham.

Millwall stopped taking a knee ahead of matches last season after the act was booed by some of the club's supporters before a game against Derby County. Instead, Millwall opted to conduct their own campaign against racism and inequality before games, asking each opposing team to join them in linking arms and displaying an anti-racism banner. Former Leyton Orient player-manager Jobi McAnuff says he is disappointed that Rowett did not condemn the fans who booed ahead of kick-off on Tuesday. ""I don't think we can be any clearer in terms of the messaging behind taking a knee and what it represents. It's the fight against racism and discrimination. It's that simple,"" McAnuff told Sky Sports. ""When somebody decides to make a racist tweet or shout racist abuse at somebody, that's a decision. These fans at this football club are making a decision to boo the players taking a knee. ""For me, there's no other explanation anymore other than they're opposing equality and that's as simple as it is. ""Yes, you're the manager of a football club and might say you can't control what a fan does when they come in. But what you can do as the figurehead is condemn it in the strongest possible terms.

How Premier League could have nine teams in European competitions next season,"The race for Europe is on but which teams make it - and how many - is still to be decided. With the Premier League campaign reaching its climax, we look at: There are seven European spots open to English sides - although that number could rise to nine and the amount of teams in each individual competition can shift. As a basis: However, because this season the FA Cup winner will be either Liverpool or Chelsea, and both those teams look set to finish in the top four, their Europa League qualifying spot for winning the FA Cup will be passed down to the next highest Premier League finisher who doesn't qualify for Europe. Similarly, because Liverpool won the Carabao Cup and are set to finish in the top four, their Europa Conference League qualifying spot from that competition will go to the next highest Premier League finisher without European football. So that means sides which finish sixth and seventh in the Premier League table are in contention for a place in either the Europa League or Europa Conference League next season. Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal would qualify for the Champions League by finishing in the Premier League's top four positions. Tottenham would go into the Europa League, along with Manchester United (who would get in thanks to Chelsea or Liverpool passing on their spot from winning the FA Cup). Seventh-placed West Ham would qualify for the Europa Conference League, thanks to Liverpool's Carabao Cup winner's spot being passed on. Manchester City and Liverpool have pulled clear at the top of the Premier League, and while their battle to win the Premier League title continues, they don't have to worry about Champions League qualification. Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp will still be plotting how to win this year's competition, and could meet in the final, but they already have their places in next season's tournament wrapped up through the league. Meanwhile, the last two spots in the top four are still up for grabs with Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham in contention with four games remaining. However, whatever the outcome, it will be a top-six finish at the very least for Chelsea and Arsenal, who return to European competition after missing out last season. Although not mathematically done yet, Spurs have all but guaranteed a Europa League spot with a nine-point gap between them and seventh-placed West Ham, who have just three matches left to play this season. Antonio Conte's side also have a far superior goal difference to the Hammers. The battle for the final Europa League spot continues between Man Utd and West Ham, while Wolves also have their eyes on finishing seventh and potentially securing a place in the Europa Conference League. If Manchester City or Liverpool win the Champions League they will automatically qualify for the competition's group stages next season. That is irrespective of where they finish in the Premier League table. If they qualify for the competition through two methods - ie: they win it and finish in the top four - there is no extra Champions League spot created for another team to fill and the number of Premier League clubs in next season's Champions League will remain at four. The Premier League could have a maximum of five teams in the Champions League next season, though, if West Ham won the Europa League and finished outside the top four. Winning that competition qualifies them for the Champions League group stages. If Leicester win the Europa Conference League they will automatically qualify for next season's Europa League - another additional European spot. That means, if West Ham and Leicester win their competitions and finish outside the Premier League's top seven there will be nine English sides in European competition next season. The nine sides would be: the top four and West Ham in the Champions League, fifth and sixth place, plus Leicester, in the Europa League, and seventh place in the Europa Conference League. But if Leicester were to win the Europa Conference League and finish seventh - the place set to be rewarded with a Europa Conference League spot - there would be no English side in the Europa Conference League next season, as Leicester would be bumped up to the Europa League. That happened in Spain last season with Sevilla and no La Liga side involved in the Europa Conference League. With Liverpool and Manchester City in the Champions League semi-finals, there's a good chance an English side would win the tournament - but that would have no impact on European qualification, with both sides set to finish in the top four. West Ham are into the semis of the Europa League and an additional Champions League spot is up for grabs if they win that competition. Their Europa Conference League spot for finishing seventh would disappear.Leicester - 10 points off seventh with two games in hand - could be playing European football again next year if they progress from their semi-final and win the Europa Conference League to earn an additional spot in the Europa League. Regardless of any permutation, no side finishing eighth in the Premier League will qualify for Europe, unless they've won a domestic or European cup. Eighth-placed Wolves would be the highest-finishing Premier League team to miss out on European football, although they are just three points behind West Ham and five off Manchester United, with a game in hand on both.
