""I'm pretty sure he's got my phone number!"" the Manchester United interim manager tells Sky Sports, standing within the inner confines of a silent Old Trafford late on Thursday evening. ""He's got another couple of games to play with Ajax, we have another three games to play here. Whenever he wants to speak with me and exchange our opinions, I'm more than happy to do that."" Erik ten Hag was appointed more than a week ago as the man to drive United into a new era, one where they're expected to be back challenging for the Premier League title and major trophies, and one which is still to even make the first tentative steps. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It is scarcely believable that nearly 10 years and four permanent managers have passed since Sir Alex Ferguson announced his retirement - the last time United were English football's top dogs. Right now, they are further away than ever from experiencing the same past glories - set to finish this season with their lowest-ever Premier League points total. But Rangnick, despite admitting the club needs ""open heart surgery"", is upbeat the process to get back to the summit might not take long, providing the right changes are made. ""Knowing Erik will be the manager, with a good recruitment process and bringing in the right players, I'm very positive the supporters and the media will be able to see a better team and, at the end, hopefully a better position in the league,"" he said. Man Utd fixtures Premier League table Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments ""There are quite a few good examples in the league with when Jurgen Klopp came to Liverpool, Pep Guardiola to Manchester City, Thomas Tuchel came to Chelsea - yes, he came in the middle of the season and inherited a top-quality squad, but you still need to win the Champions League. ""If you know what you're looking for, the profiles of the different positions you need, it shouldn't hopefully take too long."" That is where Rangnick will lend his expertise during his two-year consultancy role while managing the Austria national team. The 63-year-old was not prepared to discuss his new job or how both would be combined going forwards - and would neither offer an opinion on whether Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored eight of the team's last 9 league goals, could fit into Ten Hag's demanding style of play. ""This is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag,"" he said, after Ronaldo rescued United again on Thursday night by scoring the equaliser in their 1-1 with Chelsea. ""He's showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it's obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, it's pretty obvious."" Rangnick wants United to find and develop ""future top, star players"" who can be moulded into the club's ways rather than buying a player who is already the finished product, as they have been keen to do in recent years. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The interim boss believes combining that approach with consistent recruitment at each opportunity can, again, move United closer to the country's top teams. ""If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window,"" he said. ""They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. ""I wouldn't be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks. This shows it is possible that this can happen and it would not necessarily need three, four years in order to do that."" Ironically, United face Brentford on Monday Night Football, live on Sky Sports, a club renowned for their work in the transfer market. The Bees have reached the top-flight with their Moneyball-style use of data to drive their player recruitment - making only four signings last summer to help comfortably keep them in the Premier League for a second season. Rangnick rightly points out the difference in size between United and Brentford, which has to be taken into consideration when the two are signing players and their approach to it, but agrees every club needs to follow an 'idea'. ""No matter which club, it is always necessary and important that you need an idea,"" he said. ""You need to know how you want to play, what kind of profiles do we need because if you do not do that, you're always looking for the needle in the haystack. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""This is what I meant when I said 'open heart surgery'. I don't think it's enough to do some minor corrections and amendments. I think it's important to see the big picture and then hopefully bring in the best possible players. ""They should also fit together, this is also an issue, it is not only about bringing some players for defence, midfield and up front, it's also important you get to know the personality of the players and that they really fit and are able to meet the standards of this big club."" In the meantime, as United prepare to play their final home game of the season, Rangnick will keep on waiting to share his ideas with the man responsible for rebuilding United.

Sky Sports News reported on March 31 Ten Hag was in pole position to land the job over Mauricio Pochettino, with sources close to the manager and Ajax revealing compensation is below £2m. The 52-year-old has signed a three-year deal with the option of a further 12 months. He told United's website: ""It is a great honour to be appointed manager of Manchester United and I am hugely excited by the challenge ahead. ""I know the history of this great club and the passion of the fans, and I am absolutely determined to develop a team capable of delivering the success they deserve. ""It will be difficult to leave Ajax after these incredible years, and I can assure our fans of my complete commitment and focus on bringing this season to a successful conclusion before I move to Manchester United."" Mitchell van der Gaag, Ten Hag's assistant at Ajax, is likely to join him at Old Trafford with advanced negotiations already under way. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Edwin van der Sar, Ajax's chief executive and a former United goalkeeper, said, ""we would have liked to have kept Erik for longer"", but added, ""he is going to make the step to one of the biggest clubs in the world"". VOTE: Who should stay or leave Man Utd this summer? Why the scale of Man Utd rebuild is frightening Man Utd exodus: 18 players who could leave this summer Ten Hag Q&A: Carra's verdict on incoming Man Utd boss Ten Hag told Ajax's website: ""I'm happy that it has been finalised and that it has been officially announced. That clarity is important."" John Murtough, United's football director, said: ""During the past four years at Ajax, Erik has proved himself to be one of the most exciting and successful coaches in Europe, renowned for his team's attractive, attacking football and commitment to youth. ""In our conversations with Erik leading up to this appointment, we were deeply impressed with his long-term vision for returning Manchester United to the level we want to be competing at, and his drive and determination to achieve that. ""We wish Erik the best of luck as he focuses on achieving a successful end to the season at Ajax and look forward to welcoming him to Manchester United this summer."" Ten Hag was understood to be the unanimous choice at United following a rigorous recruitment process that was led by Murtough and Darren Fletcher, the technical director. Richard Arnold, the executive vice-chairman, was also involved and the trio are understood to have agreed Ten Hag was the best candidate for the job. Mauricio Pochettino, the Paris Saint-Germain manager who previously coached Tottenham and Southampton, and Julen Lopetegui, the Sevilla boss, were also interviewed by United, but the club are believed to have felt the Dutchman was the one that most closely aligned with their plans for the future. Pochettino and Lopetegui are understood to have interviewed well, while Luis Enrique was also considered until it quickly became apparent he was committed to Spain ahead of this year's World Cup. United were looking for a number of attributes from their new manager, including proven success, a commitment to youth, the ability to improve players and the will to introduce an attractive style of play. Ten Hag is said to have set out his long-term vision to build a successful and exciting team during conversations with United, in which he is also said to have shown enthusiasm for the challenge he now faces at Old Trafford. Sky Sports News understands Ten Hag will tell United players he does not want any passengers at the club. His key message to them will be that he is the manager, there is a new regime and United are going to go back to playing like Manchester United. If there are any players who are not up for the challenge, they are welcome to leave, but everyone will start with a clean slate. He has not been given any specific targets, but he knows his job is to make United great again. Ten Hag also wants Steve McClaren to return to United and talks about making that happen are ongoing. The good relationship between United and Ajax helped smooth the process to appoint Ten Hag. It is believed potential negotiations with PSG, had United opted for Pochettino, would have proved more problematic. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ten Hag will be United's fifth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. The club have won only three trophies in the following nine years - the FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League - while they are currently in danger of missing out on qualification for the Champions League next season. Ten Hag is set to oversee a much-needed rebuild at United, with Rangnick - who is due to take up a consultancy role at Old Trafford this summer - saying after the 4-0 thrashing at rivals Liverpool on Tuesday that the side may need up to 10 new players. A number of first-team players, including Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard and Edinson Cavani, could be set to leave as part of the overhaul, with their contracts expiring at the end of the season. On Wednesday, the departures of Jim Lawlor, United's chief scout, and Marcel Bout, the head of global scouting, were announced. Ralf Rangnick said Manchester United need to sign as many as 10 new players after their 4-0 thrashing by Liverpool on Tuesday night, but which players could leave in their rebuild? Man Utd are currently sixth in the Premier League, three points off the top four but having played a game more than both Tottenham (fourth) and Arsenal (fifth). Will they squeeze into the top four? Here are their remaining fixtures... Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports News' senior reporter Melissa Reddy: ""Manchester United's interest in Erik ten Hag came as no surprise given his status as one of the most progressive coaches in Europe, and his long links to their managerial vacancy. ""The 52-year-old has had admirers at Old Trafford stretching back to 2018/19, when his Ajax side knocked out Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, before then stunning Juventus and only being denied a place in the final after Lucas Moura's last-minute goal for Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham. ""Ten Hag is a popular choice to take charge at Old Trafford and represents what is seen as a ""fresh, exciting future"", although there is an acceptance risk is involved as it is a sizeable leap for him. ""The last highly-successful Ajax coach to move to England's top flight - via Inter - was Frank de Boer, who lasted just 77 days at Crystal Palace. ""The expectations, global glare placed on United, and level of competition at the top end of the Premier League is like nothing he would have previously experienced."" Kaveh Solhekol, Sky Sports' chief reporter: ""The timing is not ideal if you are an Ajax supporter as they are in a race to win the Dutch title, but when Man Utd came calling, Erik ten Hag really could not turn down the club. ""It suits Man Utd to make this statement today for a variety of reasons: from a PR point of view, everybody connected with Man Utd wants some good news at the moment and also, it makes it clear what is happening at Man Utd over the next few months. There is clarity now - all the players who are thinking of leaving, or who Man Utd want to sign, know Ten Hag is going to be the new manager. ""He is also going to have the whole of the summer and pre-season with the players, so that is perfect preparation as far as he is concerned. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I also think it is very significant he is being called the manager - we know one of the things he has been asking for is to be in control of everything. He does not just want to be a head coach - he wants to have control over the transfer strategy and recruitment as well. ""I think Man Utd have made a lot of mistakes when it has come to appointing managers since Sir Alex Ferguson left, but this time round they think they have the right man and obviously he has a big, big job to do. ""But people need to retain a sense of perspective as well - I know the team are not playing as well or in the kind of way a Man Utd team should be playing. But let's not forget, less than 12 months ago, Man Utd finished second in the Premier League, they finished above Liverpool and over the past decade, six of the last 10 seasons they have finished above Liverpool. ""Man Utd are still a massive, massive club - one of the biggest clubs in the world. There are obviously still issues with the ownership structure, the way the club is run, but the big problem is they have not had the right manager in charge, and when they have had the right man, they have not given that manager enough time. ""This time round, when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer lost his job five months ago, we told you the replacement was going to be either Mauricio Pochettino or Erik ten Hag. I know a lot of people would have preferred Pochettino as he had Premier League experience with Southampton and Spurs, so it is a bit of a risk going for Ten Hag. ""Yes, he has done very well in Holland, but he has been managing the biggest club in Holland, he does not have any Premier League experience, but United have spoken to various candidates, they have interviewed Ten Hag, they interviewed Pochettino as well, and they have decided to go for Ten Hag. From United's point of view, it is great they have been able to get Ten Hag and announce it so quickly."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Gary Neville speaking on The Overlap in March: ""Ten Hag worked in Bayern Munich when Pep Guardiola was there. We know the impact that had. He's won a couple of titles and cups in Holland. His style of play is good. He's got more experience than I think most people think at the age of 52. ""It's a massive jump but he's got a good coaching pedigree. He's not scarred and that's a good thing - he comes in fresh. I did a poll the other week and I was absolutely stunned - 220,000 people voted and 82 per cent were in favour of bringing him in over [Mauricio] Pochettino. ""I knew that he would be favourite because you can smell it on social media. I think Manchester United fans are demanding a fresh start and a fresh name. They want something that's completely different that they've not had before, and that's probably gone against Pochettino in some ways."" Sky Sports' Adam Bate: ""Erik ten Hag will go to Manchester United as an outsider tasked with implementing cultural change at one of the world's most famous clubs. But that is a job that he has done before. ""At Ajax, they mocked his accent. He was a Tukker - a man from the east of the country, a region known for a down-to-earth approach. There were those in sophisticated Amsterdam who did not believe the great Ajax had anything to learn from him. They were wrong. ""Two domestic doubles and one kick away from a Champions League final later and there is an acceptance Ten Hag has brought some of the best football that Ajax have seen in years. His methods have delivered success, his manner has won over the doubters."" Ten Hag's coaching journey from Twente to Ajax via Go Ahead Eagles explained in-depth by those who were there from the start... Erik ten Hag must waste no timing in tackling the pressing issues at Manchester United. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick - who is due to take up a consultancy role at Old Trafford this summer - believes the team could require 10 new players as part of a huge rebuild. With United having finally confirmed the appointment of their new manager, Sky Sports takes a look at some of the key problem areas he must rectify... Erik Ten Hag's announcement as Manchester United's new manager means we've ripped up the script for the Essential Football Podcast, with the Dutchman's unveiling heralding - yet another - new era at Old Trafford. Host Ron Walker is joined by Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher as well as senior football writer Peter Smith and features writer Adam Bate to talk about the new man, what United can expect from him and the challenges he faces at Old Trafford.

2,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/12599944/where-could-each-premier-league-team-finish,Premier League clubs' best and worst possible final positions in table,"Manchester City and Liverpool are locked in a two-horse race for the Premier League title - but how high or low could your club finish this season? Clubs have between two and five games left to seal their fate but 19 out of 20 clubs are still challenging for the title, qualification for the Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League, or to avoid the drop. Data guru Ben Mayhew has calculated each club's range of possible final league positions and found only Norwich have nothing to play for besides pride during the remainder of this season. Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United are all in the hunt to join title-tussling Manchester City and Liverpool in the top four - with Spurs and United potentially slipping as low as eighth to miss out on Europe next season altogether. With seventh spot being the lowest position to potentially offer a European berth, if permutations play out across competitions, it means all teams from fifth to 13th-placed Aston Villa retain the potential to qualify for Europe. Norwich were relegated on Saturday after a 2-0 defeat to Villa and results conspired against them elsewhere, but, theoretically, every single team sitting above the Canaries up to ninth-placed Brighton could finish in the drop zone. Watford have been widely written off in the survival race but the Hornets could still finish in 16th, while the attention for that final relegation spot centres on Everton, Leeds and Burnley - but all three could still secure a top-half finish. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Premier League fixtures Mayhew has also simulated every possible result from the remaining games and calculated the probabilities of each club's possible final positions. The results suggest Manchester City have a 69-per-cent chance of retaining their Premier League crown, while Liverpool have almost the same chance of finishing as runners-up. Chelsea are nailed down for third spot at 93 per cent, with Arsenal pipping Tottenham to the final Champions League berth at 74 per cent - while Manchester United have a whopping 94-per-cent-chance of finishing in their current sixth spot. Each club’s attacking and defensive strength have been rated using an expected goals model, which measures the quality of chances they create and allow.  These ratings were then used to simulate the rest of the season 10,000 times to measure the probability of each club finishing in each league position. Further down the table - between Brighton and Southampton - things become far less predictable, with fairly even spreads between ninth and 15th. The probabilities consign Watford to the Championship but the pressure ramps up for the final drop spot, with Leeds favourites to finish in 18th (46 per cent), followed by Everton (31 per cent) and Burnley (23 per cent).

Me and Peter weren't best of mates - actually far from it - but the most important thing is that I had huge respect for him and he produced in big moments and helped us get over the line in big matches.

""I could not leave Jaap Stam out. OK, he has not played as many games as the other lads but he was big and strong, brilliant one-v-ones. Did he have any real weaknesses? He could head it, he could leap, he could read the game, he was aggressive. He was a decent lad. I got on really well with him. I was not surprised when he left. He'd had a bad injury and when you are at a top club players do come and go. But he was a brilliant player for Manchester United."" ""The other one was an issue but I have gone with Gary Pallister.

Certain lads at United go out of their way to help you. He was obviously a very good player. Always looked exhausted but I would have him in there."" ""Bryan Robson has to go in there. Bryan was a great player for Manchester United, full of courage and scored some big goals for Manchester United when the club was not at its best. I played against Robbo a few times at Forest.

Jurgen Klopp's team head to Spain leading 2-0 as they look to progress to the final of Europe's premier club competition in Paris on May 28 against either Man City or Real Madrid. However, even if Liverpool fail to make it to the French capital, they have still managed to surpass the Chelsea side of 2006/07, whose own Quadruple challenge lasted all the way until May 1 of that campaign before losing to Liverpool in the Champions League semi-finals. And if Liverpool do manage to see off Villarreal on Tuesday, their next leg of the Quadruple will come against Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley on May 14, a repeat of this season's League Cup final, which the Reds won on penalties in February. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, in the race for the Premier League, Liverpool still just a point behind City as we enter the final four games of the season after an impressive unbeaten run in the league saw the champions' seemingly unsurmountable 14-point lead on January 15 evaporate. In total, Liverpool could face a gruelling seven-match schedule in May if they make it through to the final of European Cup at the Stade de France. So, how have other English teams got on when faced with such a daunting challenge, while surely the trophy-laden Liverpool sides of the 80s must have gone close to achieving the feat? And what about some of the great European giants of years gone by? Liverpool fixtures Premier League table As is surely common knowledge by now, no English team has ever won the Quadruple. Prior to this season, the closest any top-flight side had ever got to winning all four major trophies in a single campaign was Chelsea back in 2006/07. Heading into May of that season, Jose Mourinho's back-to-back Premier League champions had already landed the League Cup after beating Arsenal 2-1 at the Millennium Stadium, while they had an FA Cup final date to look forward to with Manchester United, who they were also going toe to toe with in the league. However, the Blues' challenge ended when they lost on penalties to Liverpool at Anfield in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final, while they would also go on to lose their title to United. Manchester United also came close to making history in 2008/09, only to slip up in the semi-finals of the FA Cup when losing 4-2 on penalties to Everton, although they did then get beaten 2-0 by Barcelona in that season's Champions League final in Rome. And, of course, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side have had numerous Quadruple bids as well since the Catalan arrived at the Etihad, the closest being in 2018/19 and last season. However, the former challenge was ended by Tottenham in the Champions League last eight and the latter after a defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals. Liverpool's current quest, though, will last at least until May 3, when the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with Villarreal concludes, meaning their Quadruple campaign will have lasted longer than any other English team's in history. And before you ask, Manchester United's famous Treble-winning season of 1998/99 actually included a League Cup quarter-final loss at Spurs in the December of that campaign. You would have thought Liverpool have come close before, but actually they have not, despite winning the League Cup four years in a row from 1981. It was the FA Cup that ultimately proved to be Liverpool's Achilles' heel in each of those four campaigns, with the Reds never managing to make it past the fifth round, meaning the closest they came was in 1982/83, only for a shock 2-1 home defeat to second division Brighton to end their Quadruple dreams in February. And it was Brighton again in the cup who scuppered the Reds' chances of winning all four trophies in their Treble-winning campaign the following season. Oddly enough, despite Klopp's 'Mentality Monsters' barely losing a game between 2018 and 2020, they never actually came close to winning the Quadruple. In fact, the nearest they came to achieving the feat was in their title-winning campaign of 2019/20, only for a youth side - selected because of a fixture clash with the Club World Cup - to lose 5-0 at Aston Villa in the League Cup quarter-finals to put an end that dream. In the first season in England when four trophies were up for grabs in 1960/61, it was Burnley who came closest before losing to Hamburg in the last eight of the European Cup in March 1961. However, Celtic did manage to accomplish the seemingly impossible in 1966-67 when Jock Stein's 'Lisbon Lions' won it all - the Scottish First Division, League Cup and Scottish Cup, followed by the first European Cup won by a British team after victory over Inter Milan. Well, the first thing to point out here is that up until the 2019-20 season, France, as in England, was the only other country in Europe's top-five major leagues to have an extra cup competition in the form of the League Cup, or Coupe de la Ligue. So that explains why European giants like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus have all never previously won the Quadruple. Paris Saint-Germain did, though, recently come within a whisker of pulling it off under Thomas Tuchel, only to fall agonisingly at the final hurdle. The big-spending Parisians were awarded that season's Ligue 1 title in April based on a points-per-game ratio after the campaign was prematurely curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when the season did eventually resume, PSG beat St Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final on July 24, before edging out Lyon 6-5 on penalties to claim the Coupe de la Ligue the following weekend. Then, when the Champions League also returned in August, Tuchel's team made it all the way to the final for the first time in the club's history, before unluckily losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. All of which shows just what a mountain Klopp and Co still face in order to make history this season...

United stopped talk of a potential walk-out demonstration by beating Brentford 3-0 in Rangnick's final home game as interim manager. Old Trafford had a feel-good environment for the game after a wretched season as it closed its doors for the summer with farewells to a host of first-team players who are out of contract. Nemanja Matic, Juan Mata, Phil Jones and Edinson Cavani in all probability made their final Old Trafford appearances, while Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard are also out of contract in the summer. Rangnick told Sky Sports: ""Apart from goalkeeping where we have three excellent goalkeepers in Tom Heaton, Dean Henderson and David de Gea, in all other areas there will be players leaving the club. I wouldn't put focus on special areas of the pitch - it should go through the whole team. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""So far we haven't been able to speak [to Ten Hag]. Erik's focus is on winning the Dutch league, our focus was on our games. ""It's obvious quite a few players will leave and there is a need for top-quality players. I strongly believe that if everyone works together we can bring Man Utd back to where we need to be. ""Other clubs only needed two or three transfer windows to challenge but from now on we need to bring in top-quality players who really help raise the level. If this happens then I don't think it should take too long."" Man Utd 3-0 Brentford - Match report Get Sky Sports Premier League table Premier League fixtures Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  One of the first players Erik ten Hag will need to talk to surrounding the future will be Cristiano Ronaldo, who has now scored nine of United's last 12 goals in the Premier League with a penalty in the 3-0 win. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner won the man-of-the-match award from Sky Sports co-commentator Gary Neville. Ronaldo's future has been cast into doubt due to United's likely failure to qualify for the Champions League, but his current deal runs until the summer of 2023. Rangnick believes if Ronaldo stays next season, he will need support in central striking positions as the player himself isn't fully comfortable at his age playing in the lone striking role. He said: ""Cristiano is not a central striker. He does not want to play in that position, in order to not play central, you have to play two strikers. If you look into international football, there are not many teams who play with two, you either have three or a false nine. It's not a question of a position, the club needs two new strikers who give this team more quality. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Modern strikers do not have to be wingers if you look at Liverpool and Man City, they have top strikers. Gabriel Jesus has hardly played and now he's playing regularly. If you ask me if he's a central striker or a winger, is Grealish a striker, they can switch and rotate. We don't have that many. Mason Greenwood would have been those players, but he's no longer part of the squad. Martial went on loan at Seville, Cavani has been injured."" United were pretty comfortable against Brentford and - with Ronaldo at the forefront - looked fluid and creative in attack. The result looks to have almost guaranteed their qualification for the Europa League next term by finishing sixth or higher - instead of playing in the Europa Conference League. ""In the end I'm not happy with the results [overall], especially in the last four or five weeks,"" Rangnick added. ""Until the West Ham game we were still in the race in three competitions. We had good moments until that West Ham game, we conceded fewer goals but in the last few weeks performances have not been as good as they should have been. In general we have lacked consistency.""

He was a constant presence at Ibrox for the past 30 years, gaining a cult status among the club's support. Bell started driving the Rangers team buses to matches across the country, before moving on to his current role as first-team head of kit. Regarded as a vital member of the Rangers' set-up, he was there during the successful times such as the nine in a row era and UEFA Cup final run and remained during administration, bottom-tier football and their return to the Scottish Premiership. In a statement, Rangers chairman Douglas Park said: ""As a club, we are absolutely devastated to learn of the loss of our colleague and more importantly, our dear friend, Jimmy Bell. ""Jimmy dedicated his life to Rangers Football Club. Having worked under managers from Graeme Souness through to Giovanni, he experienced some of the greatest days in our 150-year history. Of course, he was here during some of the lowest points, and showed selfless dedication, regardless of the challenge ahead of him. ""Jimmy's work ethic was second to none. He dedicated countless hours to preparation for each training session and game. No job was too big or too small for him, and he thrived on working for his boyhood club. ""I spoke with Jimmy regularly, having known him from his time as a mechanic and bus driver at Park's. He was excited for Thursday night's game at Ibrox, particularly having experienced a European semi-final before under Walter Smith. ""Rangers, and Scottish football as a whole, have lost a legend and a friend today. He was a family man, a devoted father, grandfather and husband. Jimmy will be sorely missed and I send our heartfelt condolences to the entire Bell family at this difficult time on behalf of Rangers Football Club.""

The rescheduled match was postponed back in February after damage was caused to the Vitality Stadium by Storm Eunice. With just three points separating the two teams, the stakes are now a lot higher: Such a prospect seemed remote early in the season as Bournemouth flew out of the blocks while Forest struggled. In response to last season's play-off semi-final defeat to Brentford, Bournemouth stormed their way to the top of the Championship this term after going unbeaten in the first 15 league games. As they had done in 2020/21, a wobble followed - consisting of six defeats in 12 games - paving the way for eventual champions Fulham to lead the way. But the Cherries had clearly learned their lessons. This time, they recovered and have almost exclusively held onto second ever since. Forest's story could not be more different. While Scott Parker and Co were flying high, Forest under Chris Hughton were bottom of the league as recently as September 18. Championship table Get NOW to stream big moments Sky Sports EFL Podcast Get Sky Sports To suggest they have thrived under Cooper - who led Swansea to the play-offs in the last two seasons - is an understatement. In his 37 league games in charge, they have won 22 and lost just four games, scoring 63 goals along the way. They travel to the south coast off the back of a stunning run of nine wins in their last 10. Bournemouth will have to be at their best to stop this machine from steamrolling its way back into the Premier League for the first time since 1999. Forest boss Cooper said his side go into the game without any fear. ""We are so looking forward to this game,"" he said. ""We are excited about it, we are focused, we are ready for it. We are thinking about wanting to win and why we want to win. ""If you get too caught up in focusing on it like a cup final then we are focusing on the wrong thing. This is what professional sport is all about, these moments, and we really want to capture the opportunity."" Bournemouth full-back Jordan Zemura added: ""Of course it's going to be absolutely buzzing here [at the Vitality Stadium]. It's our last two games and this one is a very important one. ""I'm sure the crowd are going to be on their feet for 90 minutes, and obviously they [Forest] have got good support, and a good following.

Gary Neville threw that question to his colleagues in the studio during Monday Night Football as Jamie Carragher and Roy Keane discussed the ""catastrophic fall"" and how long it might take Erik ten Hag to turn the club around. ""It is a question really for the lads, I have been asked it a few times and said that I haven't got a clue what has gone wrong really at Manchester United this season. The first task for me really is to find out what has gone wrong. ""Why has this catastrophic fall occurred? ""Why has this team that finished second last season, 10 to 12 points behind City, found themselves where they are? I still can't put my finger on that. Surely that is something that Ten Hag has to deal with first and foremost?"" Carragher pointed to the noises coming out of the dressing room. ""I think it is really interesting hearing stories about how toxic the dressing room is. Under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, there was something about Manchester United. They were nowhere near as good as Liverpool or City, but they looked like decent lads, a decent group. ""But the things that keep coming out about what is going on inside the club, who is that and where does it come from? It doesn't seem like those things were coming out in the last two seasons under Ole. The supporters were behind him. Get Sky Sports Watch with NOW Man Utd fixtures Man Utd transfer rumours ""He was never at the level of Jurgen Klopp or Pep Guardiola and was never going to overtake them, but it felt like something was just building. He was getting to semi-finals, getting closer. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""Roy keeps talking about dressing rooms to me. We were not talking about that in the last two seasons. It feels like we have been talking about it a lot this season."" Keane reiterated the importance of character. ""If you have not got a decent dressing room, forget about it, you are in trouble anyway,"" said the former United captain. ""Whatever about the talent and the board room and who the manager is, you have to have a decent dressing room, decent personalities, decent characters. ""We have seen Manchester United through the season, when things have gone against them, that is it, they throw the towel in. That is a bad reflection on the players - the senior players and the younger ones who think they have made it and are players."" Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho were signed last summer with many expecting to see an improvement. Instead, the opposite happened. Was their arrival part of the problem, perhaps? ""That is the only thing you can point to,"" said Neville. ""You can point towards Ole reaching his height and they could not go any further and they got, not sick of the message, but it had become stale and they did not believe he could overtake Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola. ""Or something had disrupted that changing room. They had put the wrong ingredient into the dish and it has made it completely go sour. That is the bit that has to be dealt with because these players are not as bad as the points tally that is on that board. ""They are better than that. There is something deeper that is wrong in that dressing room that is making them play the way they are and get the results they are getting."" The task ahead of Ten Hag is not just to climb the table but ultimately to close what has become a vast gap to the teams chasing the Premier League title. For the third season in four, United are likely to finish more than 25 points behind the champions. Perusing the list of deficits since Sir Alex Ferguson last delivered the title in 2013, Keane stressed that the quality of the opposition is a big problem for United. ""It is ugly, that,"" said Keane. ""Whatever way you look at it, it is not good. We know it is a long way back for Manchester United but of course there is a way back. Maybe the new manager coming is a good time because I always think, you cannot get any worse. ""It is the points tally that worries me because they are so far behind. Even last season Ole finishing second and you're thinking he's doing well, there is such a big gap. The biggest problem for Manchester United is where Manchester City are, where Liverpool are. ""We talk about Manchester United rebuilding as if Liverpool and Manchester City are going to take it easy over the summer. They are going to invest, they are going to get players in, they are going to get stronger. Klopp is staying on, Pep might stay on. ""When he comes in they have to get the recruitment right, he has to get players in and the right players through the door because the last few years just have not been good enough. ""The biggest disappointment for me when they have had these disappointments is the reaction. I don't think they have shown the leadership. Whatever about talent, there are not enough characters in that dressing room."" Could the example of Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool provide the template for Ten Hag in terms of expectations and the timeframe in which the new man might have United challenging again? Carragher believes so. ""I think it is very similar, it really is,"" he explained. ""I think it was possibly a harder job for Jurgen Klopp because the funds are there for the next Manchester United manager. We have seen that over the last 10 years and going forward will be a lot more than what Klopp had when he first came in. ""People talk about how long it should take Ten Hag or any top manager at a top club. There is talk of Liverpool and Manchester City possibly being five years ahead, I have even heard 10 years ahead of Manchester United. I think it is rubbish, I really do. ""I think a top manager gets a top club back on track in a couple of years. That is not to say winning the title or the Champions League but they get them back on track where they are competing. ""Liverpool came in November and they finished eighth in his first season. In some ways it would probably be better for United if they finished eighth and there was no European football. ""But they still reached a Europa League final, beat Manchester United on the way, some top teams, Villarreal, Borussia Dortmund, you thought there was something happening.  ""In that second season, the first full season, he got Champions League. That has to be what Manchester United get next season under Ten Hag. He has to. ""Liverpool were back on track in that third season. All great clubs should be judged on the Premier League and the Champions League. Not necessarily winning it but in with a shout. ""That is where Liverpool come in, they were Champions League runners-up in season three. They go on to win it and then win the Premier League but they are back at the party in year three. That is why I think the talk of five years or more is a nonsense."" Neville rejects the idea that Klopp had it harder than Ten Hag. ""I don't think so. Jurgen Klopp has done the most outrageous job at Liverpool, it has been outstanding. But there were no real set winners at that time when he came in. ""I would liken the job that Ten Hag has coming in and taking on these two outstanding managers who have set foundations at their clubs for five years more like Gerard Houllier's job when he came in and Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger were set. ""You are coming in when there are two or three managers - because I could put Thomas Tuchel in there as well - are set in their jobs and have that foundation. I think the job that Ten Hag has is absolutely huge."" But Neville accepts the timeframe suggested by Carragher. ""I don't disagree with Jamie's timeline of Champions League [qualification] in the first two seasons while he is sorting the recruitment out and getting used to the club. Third season getting very close to the point where the club has confidence and winning a trophy maybe. ""And that fourth year and fifth year is where you want to be winning a title, that is what we are looking at realistically. We would all hope he comes in and blows everyone away and Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola blow up somehow. But they are not blowing up are they?"" Even so, Keane thinks Ten Hag will back himself to have a big impact. ""Any top coach would come in with a bit of an ego and believe they can make a difference - certainly to this group,"" said Keane. ""They can't get any worse next season, surely? They can maybe win a cup or whatever and rebuild the club. ""Any top manager will believe he can get a reaction from the players and he will get backing. It might take a couple of windows but a good manager will believe that he can turn things around pretty quickly. Not in terms of winning trophies, but competing. ""The fans and the club have to get confidence in this new manager. Over the last few years, there have been doubts about Mourinho's style, Van Gaal, David Moyes, Ole. When he comes in, he needs proper support and that power he deserves to get.""

In a press conference by the Austrian FA, Rangnick was appointed the new national team manager until 2024, with a clause inserted into the contract which states that the deal will be renewed for another two years if the country qualifies for Euro 2024. Rangnick was quoted by the Austrian FA website as saying: ""It's an honour for me to take on the role of team boss. I'm particularly excited about the prospect of contesting the European Championships in Germany with a young team hungry for success."" The 63-year-old replaced Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at United at the end of November, agreeing to take temporary charge of the team until the summer, before remaining in a consultancy role. However, results have been disappointing under Rangnick, with United currently sixth in the Premier League, five points behind Arsenal in the fourth and final Champions League spot for next season as the campaign draws to a close. Ajax manager Erik ten Hag was recently announced as United's permanent boss for next season, although Rangnick will, as planned, still stay on as a consultant. That role will encompass six days a month for the next two years, meaning the German would be able to combine the work with his Austria duties. ""I'm very much looking forward to it,"" said Rangnick, when asked about his United consultancy role.

Ronaldo moved level with Heung-min Son in joint second in the Premier League goalscoring charts with his 17th of the season on Thursday, earning United a 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Thursday evening with what was his fifth strike in his last three games for the club. The 37-year-old has scored eight of United's last nine goals, including match-winning hat-tricks against Tottenham and Norwich, in an emphatic response to criticism that came his way earlier in the season during a run of one goal in 10 games. Neville and Keane both highlighted Ronaldo's ill fit for Ten Hag's high-pressing style, but said the five-time Ballon D'Or winner's sheer quality meant he should have a chance to see out the second of his two-year contract at Old Trafford. Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, Neville said: ""He lifts the fans, he gets them on the edge of their seats, takes his chances, and it'll be really interesting to see what happens with Erik Ten Hag. ""We knows he plays with an aggressive press, he tries to win the ball high up the pitch, that isn't Cristiano's strong point and we know that. But he will want a goalscorer. He will want someone who can put the ball in the back of the net 20 or 25 times.

He's achieved everything and more in the game, his professionalism is beyond anything you could ever wish for, really. Ronaldo stunner rescues a point against Chelsea Premier League top goalscorers Get Sky Sports Rangnick to become Austria manager; will continue at Man Utd ""He still continues - his persistence, his determination to score goals is absolutely incredible. You can't speak highly enough of him, his goal tonight was wonderful and he doesn't really lose that belief in himself when the rest of the team is really lacking in confidence - his is still there. ""He's a sensation, an absolute sensation. I talked about the attitude of the players in the first half and I wasn't really talking about him, he's proven over a long period of time and what he's doing, the shape of his body and the recovery from the tragedy only last week to still perform, to get back on the bike and go when he could've easily said he was staying off for a few weeks. In a poor season for United he's been a bright light in some ways."" Keane highlighted Ronaldo's mastery of ""the hardest part of the game"" - scoring goals: he has scored 20 times in 12 consecutive league seasons, with the possibility to make that 13 in the final three matches of this campaign. And the former United captain said the bit-part defensive role some former strikers, including Eric Cantona and Ruud Van Nistelrooy, had played during his time at the club shows how Ten Hag could build a pressing team around Ronaldo during his first season at the helm. Keane told Sky Sports: ""I know people are quick to criticise what [Ronaldo] doesn't do, in terms of his pressing, but he was never great at that anyway. He's the greatest at the hardest part of the game - putting the ball in the back of the net. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""That was his only chance tonight. Look at the chances Chelsea were creating; imagine if he'd been in the Chelsea team - he'd probably get 50 goals. ""Ten Hag will be having a sleepless night watching the team, but if you've got a player in the group who can score that amount of goals, they have to be involved. He'll want to play week-in, week-out, the new manager will come in and will be looking for another striker but Ronaldo's not hanging around unless he's playing. ""That's his biggest challenge, working with these personalities. As brilliant as they are, he has to get a team who can compete. And if that's winning the ball back high and pressing, Ronaldo is not good at that. But I still think you can have him in your team and have other players who can do that. ""Cantona, Van Nistelrooy wouldn't be great at chasing the ball back for you, but we had enough lads in the team who could win it. People say you need all your players to press, but you can get away with it with one player, and as long as they're producing the goods you'll forgive them."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking after Ronaldo's latest point-winning goal involvement, interim manager Ralf Rangnick said Manchester United have become reliant on the Portuguese forward, and will have to invest in that department when the transfer window opens. ""Yes, right now we very much rely on Cristiano,"" he said at the press conference following the Chelsea draw. ""He also showed a good performance when Chelsea were in possession, he helped out a lot in the second half defensively. ""There has to be a focus on bringing in a couple of new strikers, this is for sure."" Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6. Play for free, entries by 3pm ",positive

The 63-year-old is set to fail in his objective of leading the stuttering club to Champions League qualification but still hopes to leave a lasting legacy at Old Trafford. Rangnick will switch from United's interim boss to a consultancy role in the summer - a job that will run in tandem with his new position as manager of Austria's national team. The German has an impressive track record of developing teams, recently succeeding with RB Leipzig and sister club RB Salzburg, and believes transfers are key to providing incoming boss Erik ten Hag that platform to succeed. ""For me, the most important bit is recruitment now,"" Rangnick said when asked what he will be advising on. ""This is, for me, the most vital point, that we bring in the best possible players and speak about that, who could that be. ""It's not only identifying those players but meeting them, convincing them to join this club, even though we will not be playing in the Champions League. Get Sky Sports Premier League table Man Utd fixtures Transfer Centre LIVE! ""This is what I see as the most important bit. Again, also, with regard to top talented players for the academy, identifying those kind of players."" Asked if United can go back to buying players at the peak of their powers, Rangnick said: ""My personal opinion is that the club should try to find future top star players and develop them. ""Again, on the other hand, just tell me five players that might be some of those players that you spoke about."" When Haaland and Kylan Mbappe were reeled off, Rangnick said: ""Haaland is a young player. He's 21 or 22. This is one of those players I spoke about. ""But, on the other hand, he has developed in the last two years into one of probably the most expensive strikers in the world. ""But, yes, he could be, he would be one of those examples where I think the focus should be on to try and identify and find and then convince players who could be Manchester United players for the next couple of years."" Rangnick believes United's support, stadium and training facilities still make them an attractive proposition irrespective of Champions League qualification. But that view also comes with a dose of realism given rivals Manchester City and Liverpool are flying high, with the club targeting the ""full package"" of ""mentality, quality, physicality, pace, skills"" in new players. Rangnick says it is obvious that the team need additions given their struggles and departing players, with Monday's match against Brentford looking to be an Old Trafford farewell for out-of-contract Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic. ""I would like to (play them) but it's also about getting the best possible result and the best possible performance,"" he said. ""It's not about making any gifts to players. ""Juan Mata played the last 15 minutes, Nema almost the whole game, so it's not about saying farewell to the supporters. ""If that is possible I would do that or I would like to do that, but it's also about getting the best possible result."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Rangnick hopes to have Fred back for Monday's match and captain Harry Maguire may return, while Edinson Cavani - another out of contract in the summer - was due to return to training on Friday. But the 63-year-old says Jadon Sancho will be absent against Brentford and ""might be out for the rest of the season with his tonsillitis"". Asked if Sancho was having his tonsils out, Rangnick added: ""It could happen. ""He's definitely got an inflammation on his tonsils and has also had some high temperatures, so that's why he was not available (against Chelsea) and he will most certainly not be available for the next two games. ""Hopefully, they can get hold of that inflammation and then hopefully if the tonsils have to be taken out and removed this can happen at the end of the season.""

14,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11748/12187923/how-brentfords-transfer-strategy-has-been-altered-by-brexit,How Brentford's transfer strategy has been altered by Brexit,"Brentford have become renowned for spotting, signing and developing players from the lower divisions ofEurope. Their philosophy of bringing them in for modest fees and selling on for tens of millions, from the UK and the continent, as better players has helped establish them as promotion contenders to the Premier League. But under the new work permit rules brought in as a result of Brexit, several of their biggest success stories would not have been possible. Neal Maupay, for example, who was bought for £1.8m from Saint-Etienne and sold to Brighton for £20m, would not have reached the new 15-point threshold, and neither would Said Benrahma, who was signed for £1.5m is worth £25m in his current loan to West Ham. So what do the new rules mean for Brentford's recruitment strategy? Will they have to change tact? And does it put into jeopardy their long-term progress? The changes have impacted Brentford's strategy, and probably the most tangible is on the amount of talent they have to scout and choose targets from; it will be greatly reduced. They have a sizeable scouting network that has been covering most of Europe, including the lower reaches of France and Germany, but much of this work is now redundant. So the club are working on an automated system that will instantly flag whether a player would gain a work permit or not before he is watched, which will reduce the scouting pool from the thousands to the hundreds, and this is seen as a positive by recruitment staff. Despite a smaller list, the club feel there will still be enough talent on the continent for them, but expect to face more competition and may need to pay more than they have done before to get them. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines January transfer window 2021: All you need to know Premier League ins and outs On their side is that the club have grown in stature since the signings of Maupay and Benrahma in 2017 and 2018, and can attract players ready for the top level of the Championship immediately; which is what they need. They have also recouped significant funds from player sales to be able to afford them, notably Ollie Watkins to Aston Villa for £33m. This has allowed them to invest as much as £10m in Ivan Toney from Peterborough, for example; a player that really has hit the ground running. This is the kind of signing fans should expect to see more of. One shift the Bees will make is to focus even more on talent coming from the lower leagues in the UK than they have done already. Brentford would be keen to give homegrown players a clearer pathway to first-team football. They have found considerable success from here already too; Watkins to name one, Ethan Pinnock another. Toney looks set to follow. This is also what the B team was set up for in part, and the shift has already been indicated in recent signings at this level; none more so than Max Haygarth from Manchester United's U23s. One thing Brentford will not be doing is rushing to establish a presence in the newly-accessible South American market. A number of clubs, representation agencies and intermediaries in the UK have been rushing to build connections to bring talent in from this region, which is now on a par with Europe as far as the Home Office is concerned. The Bees do not have a strong network in South America, having carefully built theirs in Europe, and this is where their focus will remain for the foreseeable future. They believe their set-up is dynamic enough to be able to 'play it by ear' to an extent, and adapt to market changes when they occur. Brentford's project has always had the goal of winning promotion to the Premier League. And with the club now firmly among the contenders, planning is in motion to strengthen the squad to be able to stay there. The club are looking across all positions for players with the ability to come straight in and make an impact. They have put a strong squad together that has dealt fairly well with some key injuries this season, so any player coming in would have to improve them. The club are aware of interest from bigger clubs in several key players too; notably the left-back Rico Henry, central midfielder Josh Dasilva and goalkeeper David Raya. But they will not sell any of them in the current window in the hope they will be a Premier League club come the summer and they can keep them. But should they miss out again this season, these are also positions the club will need to find quality replacements for; players that will not need the season-or-so that the likes of Maupay and Benrahma had to adjust.
