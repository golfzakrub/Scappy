The former winger gave some kind words to the Denmark centre-back who is set to leave this club this summer upon the expiration of his contract and looks to be joining Barcelona.  With the club still affected by sanctions imposed by the UK government on Roman Abramovich at present, Chelsea are potentially facing an anxious summer. Behind the scenes a lot of work is being done to find a new owner, and at the moment, the Ricketts family are one one of the favourites to takeover, despite opposition from the club’s fans. Alongside Christensen to potentially leave, Antonio Rudiger also hasn’t signed a new deal. With players allowed to depart, and Chelsea limited on how much money they can spend on a day-to-day basis, the club will be unable to sign any new players. But those who will be returning from loan spells are able to feature next season. One such youngster is Colwill, who is currently playing his trade with Championship outfit Huddersfield.  He’s enjoyed a fantastic campaign having started 23 times in the second-tier this season, as the former Premier League side push to make a return to the top flight. And on Twitter, Canoville was keen to sing his praises after thanking Christensen for the service he’s provided to the club “Andreas has been superb for our club @ChelseaFC since coming from academy and learning trade on loan,” the 60-year-old wrote. “European and world champion. Wish him well with Barcelona. “Levi @levi_colwill is going to be by far the better player! #ImagineNotBeingChelsea” 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1

City retained their narrow one-point advantage in the Premier League title race as the two sides could not be separated in 90 minutes. Kevin De Bruyne opened the scoring for City after just five minutes. Diogo Jota ensured neither goalkeeper would be taking home a clean sheet as he equalised just eight minutes later. City retook the lead on 35 minutes as Gabriel Jesus fired home. And Sadio Mane equalised again right at the start of the second half. Despite attacking substitutions and chances for both sides, neither found a winner and the game ended 2-2.  Asked if he felt the game lived up to the billing, Keane said on Sky: “Yeah absolutely. “I think the quality, and what impressed me with all these top quality players is the desire to keep going to try and win the game at the end. “The chances, no team was ever really gonna dominate the game for long spells because there was so much quality on both sides. “Liverpool struggled to get going, but then in the second half they showed their character.  “We saw at the start of the second half, Jurgen Klopp obviously had a go at them at half time and said, ‘Listen, you’ve gotta start showing your true colours.’ “We saw that in the second half, but then City had some great chances as well. “It was just a great reminder to us all about what this game is about, that’s why we love this game, I thought it was fantastic. “I really enjoyed it and credit to all the players, I thought they were fantastic.” ",positive,liverpool,2

The Canaries can see a crack of light in their pursuit of Premier League survival following a 2-0 win over Burnley that leaves them seven points from salvation.  Still bottom of the table, goals from Pierre Lees-Melou and Teemu Pukki cut the deficit for Dean Smith’s side, giving Norwich something to play for in their final seven games of the season. And Dowell was confident that there’s plenty more to come from his side, particularly when looking at the fixtures of other relegation battlers. When asked by talkSPORT if Norwich can stay in the league, the Everton academy graduate said: “Definitely yeah, I think that was a statement from us today, to show that we’re not going anywhere either. “Seven points away from Everton and now they’ve got some tough fixtures coming up and we’ve got some we think we can win so you never know.” Norwich’s next opportunity to put points on the table will come on April 10 when they take on footballing giants Manchester United at Old Trafford. Few will give the Canaries a chance of taking something from the match, except for Dowell.  Asked if Norwich can take something from the United game, Dowel said: “Yeah, I reckon we’ve got an upset there.” Goalscorer Pukki was similarly positive about Norwich’s chances of staying up telling talkSPORT his side have it in them. “If we believe we have what it takes,” Pukki said. “We know against some other teams we need to play even better than we did today if we want to get points. “We all want to stay in this league so we need to do what it takes to do it, but we know it’s going to be hard, we are behind others so it’s a tough job but we need to go every game and try to win.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Since being appointed as interim manager in November 2021, the Red Devils’ fortunes haven’t improved too much as they now face a mountainous task to qualify for the Champions League. In his time at the Theatre of Dreams, the former RB Leipzig manager has seen his side be knocked out of the FA Cup and the Champions League. The impact on their league position is the most damming, as they sit in the exact same position they were in when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was relieved of his duties. With Erik Ten Hag the frontrunner to take over in the summer, the task he has in rebuilding the club’s fortunes looks daunting. At the end of the season, Rangnick is set to take up a consultancy role, but he still has seven games left of this campaign to try and ensure Man United are playing in Europe’s top tier competition when his successor arrives. At present this is looking unlikely as his side are six points behind fourth-placed Tottenham. And speaking on the Sunday Session, Groves said he thinks his impact has been insufficient at Old Trafford.  “I haven’t seen him make any impact,” he said. “I’m not sure if they’re a passing, expansive team, if they’re a closing down team, if they’re a counter attack team. “And I said at the time when Rangnick went in, I know all the other managers and coaches loved him because of his philosophies. “He’s looking at a dressing room, and they’re looking at him, ‘you’ve got no kudos, what’s on your CV?’  “And there’s a fractured relationship between all of the players at Man United, there’s no togetherness in that team. “I think a manager with a bigger stature wouldn’t have indulged people. “So Rangnick is swimming against the tide because that culture was set in way before that.” 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply  ",positive,liverpool,1

Kevin De Bruyne, Diogo Jota, Gabriel Jesus and Sadio Mane were the goalscorers in a frenetic game that did little to confirm who the 2021/22 Premier League champions will be. IT'S IN!!! Kevin De Bruyne fires Manchester City in front after five minutes!! 😮 pic.twitter.com/tdaGcE4VFz City started extremely brightly and were close to taking the lead inside four minutes. De Bruyne powered forwards from midfield and played the ball to Jesus on the right wing. He squared it across the box to Raheem Sterling who was denied by Alisson from close range. However, Alisson was powerless to prevent De Bruyne’s opening goal just a minute later. Liverpool were wide open again when the Belgium midfielder skipped past Fabinho and fired in a shot which took a big deflection off Joel Matip and went in off the far post. The Reds knew they had to respond, and did so in swift fashion as City’s advantage lasted just eight minutes.  LEVEL!! Diogo Jota equalises for Liverpool! 👊How many goals are we going to have here? 👀💥 pic.twitter.com/US3pFMFtSb Andy Robertson crossed to the far post where fellow full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold received the ball and cut it back to Jota who beat Ederson for his fourth goal in five matches. There was a scare for the City goalkeeper ten minutes later as he almost committed a howler for an own-goal and let the ball run onto his line. Ederson ultimately kept his cool to clear away before the onrushing Jota could get a brace. Instead it was City who retook the lead on 35 minutes. The ball dropped to Joao Cancelo whose long cross picked out the deep run of Jesus and the Brazilian finished past Alisson with a half-volley via the underside of the crossbar.  BIG GAME PLAYER! Gabriel Jesus puts Manchester City back in front! 😤 pic.twitter.com/TAM6Bxa2y8 At half-time, the hosts went in 2-1 up, but Liverpool equalised again just 47 seconds after the restart. Jordan Henderson and Alexander-Arnold combined on the right and when the ball came to Mohamed Salah he picked out the onrushing Sadio Mane to blast past Ederson. Despite the Reds’ fast start to the second period, City built their way back into the driving seat. Sterling thought he’d given the hosts the lead for the third time in the 64th minute, only to be denied by a tight VAR offside call.  🎙️ ""Alexander-Arnold… Salah… IN FOR SADIO MANEEE!"" It's level AGAIN at the Etihad!! What a game 🤯 pic.twitter.com/os2x3jEB6X Luis Diaz entered the fray with 20 to go as Liverpool sought a winner, while Riyad Mahrez came on for City. Roberto Firmino and Jack Grealish also joined the action in the last ten minutes. Despite these changes though, there were no further goals as Mahrez spurned the last chance of the game and it ended 2-2. The result sees City remain one point ahead of Liverpool with seven games still to play this season. ",negative,liverpool,6

Davies made a massive 490 appearances for the Welsh side during a 16-year career, but has sadly seen his health deteriorate in recent years. The 72-year-old has dementia and resides in Bay Tree House care home in Wrexham, while he is also in a wheelchair, complicating his travel to London. Supporters had quickly picked up on Davies’ struggles, starting the campaign, #GetGarethToWembley on social media. The push to send the former defender to the final against Bromley on May 21 quickly gathered momentum, with Wrexham striker Ollie Palmer working to help, and now he has the might of Hollywood behind him. “Rob [McElhenney] and I will make sure Gareth makes it to Wembley in comfort,” owner Reynolds Tweeted. “He showed up for @Wrexham_AFC and we’ll show up for him. #GarethIsGoingToWembley” The seemingly successful campaign to get Davies to Wembley was started by Martin Evans, whose wife used to care for former Wales international Davies.

Manchester United and England icon Rio Ferdinand once strained a tendon in his knee by having his leg up on a coffee table for too long while watching TV. And Arsenal hero Perry Groves revealed one of his teammates had to miss a game for an even more bizarre reason. Anders Limpar was a brilliant player for the Gunners, and a key member of the league winning side of 1990/91 and part of their 1992/93 squad which won both domestic cups. He was also a boyhood hero ofWayne Rooney in the mid 90s, when he racked up 66 Premier League games for Everton. “I’d say Anders was my idol,” said the Manchester United and England legend. “I liked him because he used to shoot and dribble more than Duncan Ferguson.” There was no questioning the Swede’s impact on the pitch, but there was one odd moment during his time at Highbury. Groves told talkSPORT’s Sunday Session, the former winger decided to try and improve his performances with a spot of manscaping. Yes, you heard that right, nothing on his chest, legs and armpits and, to add insult to injury, it also meant him missing a game for Arsenal.  Groves said: “When I was at the Gooners, Anders Limpar, brilliant player, he came in training one day and we looked over and he shaved all of his body hair off, under his armpits, everything. “I said to ‘Anders what are you doing?’ “He goes ‘it makes me go through the air quicker’. “I went, ‘you’re not a beaver Anders’. “He did it because of that, and he couldn’t play the next game because he had a rash everywhere.” 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply   ",positive,liverpool,1
8,https://talksport.com/football/1083536/west-ham-brentford-champions-league-tottenham-arsenal/,West Ham miss opportunity to leapfrog Arsenal and keep in touch with Tottenham in race for Champions League as they lose to Brentford,"West Ham missed the opportunity to move above Arsenal in the Premier League table as they succumbed to a 2-0 loss against Brentford. Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney were central to the goals as they both scored and assisted each other in the Bees victory. After the Gunners and Manchester United both dropped points against Brighton and Everton respectively, the Irons had the chance of making the most of their defeats. Victory would have put David Moyes’ side on 54 points and into fifth place above the Gunners on goal difference. Crucially it also would have kept their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League via a top four place alive, as they would moved to within three points of Antonio Conte’s Tottenham. But after defeat at the Brentford Community Stadium, the Hammers have now played a game more than Spurs, and are six points behind them. Whilst they are still in the race, their chances do look slim. For Thomas Frank and his players though, its another excellent victory and it continues their fine form. It’s now four wins in their last five league games, and two on the bounce after their sensational victory at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea.  As for the game though, Moyes could have little to complain as his players did little to threaten goalkeeper David Raya. Tomas Soucek had a header that went straight at him, and they didn’t do much more to create any clear cut chances. Their day became even worse when Kurt Zouma was taken off midway through the first half with injury, and Issa Diop came on in his place.  And as if their day wasn’t bad enough, it got even worse just moments after half time. From a throw-in Toney had time and space to flick the ball forward, and Mbeumo, on his bike, ran through a space between Aaron Cresswell and Craig Dawson then proceeded to smash the ball past Lukasz Fabianski into the bottom right corner. In a bid to try and change the score-line Moyes brought on Said Benrahma against his former club. He received a nice moment when coming on as he was applauded by the supporters. However he didn’t make much of an impact, and Brentford put the tie to bed just after the hour mark.  After receiving a cross on the left from Rico Henry, The Frenchman returned the favour after knocking the ball back across the six yard box for Toney to head home. Speaking on talkSPORT’s Sunday Session, former Arsenal winger Perry Groves was critical of the defending, but did praise Henry and Mbeumo’s role in the goal. “Really poor defending, Rico Henry gets to the byline, and he’s really underrated, Mbeumo gets the cross in, and what a ball by the way,” he said. There were further opportunities for the hosts to add more gloss to the score-line, and after finding the net once, Mbeumo could have done it again.  A few yards out, he sent his volley over the bar, but it didn’t prove to be a costly miss. Whilst it was a disappointing day for West Ham, they still have a lot to play for and will hope to bounce back against Lyon in the Europa League on Thursday. 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1
9,https://talksport.com/football/1083549/burnley-maxwell-cornet-norwich-everton-relegation-battle/,Burnley’s survival hopes melt away as stunning Maxwell Cornet miss gifts Norwich three points and delights Everton,"Burnley star Maxwell Cornet may be one of the signings of the season, but his shocking miss, during a damaging 2-0 defeat against Norwich, may prove decisive. The game between the relegation battlers was bookended by goals from Pierre Lees-Melou and Teemu Pukki, securing three points for the Canaries, but the Clarets weren’t short of chances.  With Sean Dyche’s men 1-0 down and looking to get back into the game, star winger Dwight McNeil produced a heavenly cross in the 65th minute to lay the ball on the plate for superb summer signing Cornet. However, despite the Ivorian forward leading the team with an important seven goals, the one he failed to score might be the most crucial of the lot. The former Lyon man connected with McNeil’s cross, but sent the ball wide before collapsing into a heap of disbelief on the sideline. Burnley manager Sean Dyche went easy on Cornet while speaking to talkSPORT, but felt it was a game-changing moment. “You don’t expect him to score but a player of his prowess with the goals he’s scored for us, I would say it’s a very good chance,” Dyche said. “[It] probably defined the game because if that goes in I think the feel of the stadium was changing at that time.  “We’re on the front foot and Dwight McNeil had come on and was going very well and looked very sharp when he came on. “I think that might have taken the game in a different direction but the fact is we didn’t score it and that’s been the story of the season. “Creating really good chances and not taking them and that freedom in the final third which was lacking today.” Pukki later punished Burnley’s wastefulness by putting the game to in the 86th minute, pulling the Canaries within three points of their defeated opponents.  But the result will almost certainly be far more season-defining for Burnley and fellow basement battlers Everton, who now have a four-point cushion to over Dyche’s side courtesy of their headline 1-0 win over Manchester United. As for Norwich though, the home crowd were able to enjoy a day in the sun with a win for just the fourth time this season and may perhaps have just cracked the door ajar for a great escape.  A ninth-minute deflected strike from Lees-Melou had given the Frenchman his first Norwich goal, and with four to play, a far more experienced Canaries goalscorer, Pukki, put the game to bed. A moment of sheer class from Mathias Norman found the Finn in space, who then had all the time in the world to pick a corner past a beaten Nick Pope. Dean Smith’s men are now seven points from safety and Everton in 17th, but Frank Lampard’s Toffees will be far more thankful than worried about another key result in the relegation battle. 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1

England’s two best teams have enthralled fans with their unique rivalry for years headed by elite coaches Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp. With just one point separating the sides at the top of the table, the result of Sunday’s showdown could prove pivotal in the title race. City have won three of the last four Premier Leagues with Liverpool the only team to break their stronghold on the trophy. When the two sides face each other a number of big stars will be on show but it could have been so different for several key players. Every football fan is aware of the journey both Kevin de Bruyne and Mohamed Salah made from their Chelsea days to becoming Premier League superstars. But what about the forgotten careers of some of the other stars lining up in City v Liverpool? talkSPORT.com takes a look… Atletico Madrid have unveiled the signing of Diogo Jota.He arrived from Paços de Ferreira on a 5-year deal. pic.twitter.com/kJNhD8ZZ2i Liverpool’s No. 20 has proved a revelation since his £41million move from Wolves in September 2020. Jota followedNuno Espirito Santo to Molineux after the pair worked together during the 2016/17 campaign at Porto. However, the 25-year-old was only on loan at the Portuguese giants from Atletico Madrid – where he spent two years. Jota never played a competitive game for Atleti but did manage to score against them in Liverpool’s 2-0 Champions League win in November. “I don’t regret (going to Atletico),” He told the Athletic in 2020. “They were playing in the Champions League final the season before. The opportunity to go there and have all the pre-season with them meant a lot to me and I learned a lot. “Yes, I could have expected better but I don’t regret it. In the end, leaving was the best option for me at that time in terms of my career.”  The 28-year-old still remains under contract with Liverpool despite the fact that he hasn’t played a game for them in four years. The former Mainz goalkeeper joined the Merseyside giants in 2016 and made 49 appearances under Klopp – but none since his calamitous display in the 2018 Champions League final against Real Madrid. Ironically it was a 4-3 win over City, where he spent two years as a youth player, in January 2018 that first started Karius’ run as Liverpool’s No. 1. And now the German couldn’t be any further from returning to the Etihad this Sunday as an option for the Reds.   The Portuguese makes Juventus’ decision to cash in on him in a part exchange with Danilo look all the more baffling every game he plays. But City do have two former Manchester United players to thank for his development as well considering the time Cancelo spent at Valencia. The 27-year-old ultimately spent four years in Spain before moving to Italy – one of which he spent working under Phil Neville who was coach. Several months were even spent under Gary’s tutelage during his ill-fated Valencia stint and Cancelo impressed the United icon. “I absolutely loved him when he was out there,” said Nevilleon his podcast. Neville added: “I had him as a very young player at Valencia but you could just see exceptional talent. “I made calls back to England – and you can imagine which club at the time – saying that if you are ever going to take a young player that is a young player you would take.”  The Brazilian arrived at Madrid’s ‘B’ team with little fanfare considering the club already had Jose Mourinho and Cristiano Ronaldo. It was the Special One who handed Fabinho his first team debut in May 2013, as he emerged as a late substitute in a 6-2 win over Malaga. The 28-year-old still managed to grab an assist for the final goal but he never played for Madrid again as he moved to Monaco. Ironically it was the Champions League final defeat to Los Blancos that led to Liverpool springing to sign him less than 24 hours later. Fabinho featured for the Reds against Madrid last season and opened up about the unusual way he found out he was heading to the Bernabeu.  “We arrived in Portugal, but I stayed around at Rio Ave for just two weeks, maybe three at the most,” Fabinho toldFourFourTwo. “I had a barbecue with other Brazilians and then my agent called to say that Real Madrid Castilla [Real Madrid reserve team] needed a right-back and wanted to know if I was interested. “Then one night, Lucio [Araujo, brother of former Chelsea and Barcelona midfielder Deco], came and told me to pack my things because Jorge Mendes was on his way by car in the early hours of the morning. “I was like, ‘Is something wrong?’ Nobody said a word, but then at some point in the car, Mendes said we were travelling to Madrid and that I would sign for them. “I called my mum in Brazil to tell her about that and she started to cry. “No-one had expected something this huge to happen in such a short time. It was a very special moment for me.”  He continued: “We headed to the hotel in Madrid, and while I was still sleeping, I woke up to somebody knocking on the door. “I looked through the peephole and couldn’t believe it. It was Mendes and Jose Mourinho! “I was still wearing my pyjamas, not at all prepared to meet him. I didn’t even know what to say. “He wanted to welcome me. I was still a bit shy and never thought I would meet him like that!” City’s £100m man recently joked on England duty that he was not as good as Jude Bellingham as a teenager considering he was in League One. But to be fair to Grealish, he still managed five goals and seven assists during a memorable 2013/14 campaign at Notts County in what was his only temporary departure from his beloved Aston Villa. And ironically he was briefly joined at the club by a future England and City teammate in Kyle Walker. During several loan stints away from Tottenham before he broke into their first team, Walker ended up playing 15 games for Villa. And his first ever Premier League goal came at Villa Park as he unleashed a stunning 30-yard pile-driver in a 2-2 draw with Fulham in 2011. It also gave ex-Spurs defender Walker the chance to play alongside Arsenal icon Robert Pires in the nine games he featured for Villa. Congrats, @JackGrealish! 🤩🖤 https://t.co/vvf6MP0r7t pic.twitter.com/oNE8sj1vNR  City made headlines around the world when they splashed £47.5m on the 22-year-old to sign him from Everton in 2016. But the transfer also benefitted Barnsley, who had a sell-on clause when they allowed Stones to move to Goodison Park as a teenager. He only spent a year at his hometown club after coming through the ranks at Oakwell such was the talent he boasted. Bobby Hassell, who was Barnsley’s captain when Stones was there, told the Independent: “In all honesty I don’t think the club realised how big a talent they had with John. “Nothing had been spoken about in terms of this great young lad coming through, but he made a big impression during his first month of training with the first team. “When we saw him, the senior pros, we did actually say that we thought the kid would go on and play Premier League and international football.”  Liverpool notably snapped up Elliott as a 16-year-old from Fulham after he became the youngest ever to make a Premier League appearance. However, the winger was once part of the youth set up at Queens Park Rangers before swapping over to join their London rivals. As a boyhood Red, Elliott even had the chance to walk out alongside then-QPR captain Joey Barton when Liverpool came to Loftus Road in 2012. “My main hero I would say was Steven Gerrard,” Elliott toldLFCTV. “I was lucky enough to meet him actually when I was a mascot for QPR vs. Liverpool – when Coates scored a scissor kick. “I was there and I was playing for QPR at the time and I was lucky I was able to be the mascot for Liverpool [game]. “To obviously meet my hero, I think I actually did get emotional after it as well.”   888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,13

The ex-Atletico Madrid and Barcelona striker said the England star ‘could be the best English talent of his generation’.  At 21 years old, Foden might still be considered inexperienced, but isn’t showing it as defences find it near impossible to stop him. Atletico Madrid found as much in the Champions League in midweek, when the academy product came off the bench and, within the first two minutes, produced the assist to give City a 1-0 win. Since his league debut in 2017, Pep Guardiola has slowly and surely brought him into the first team. And now he is one of the first names on the team sheet for the Spaniard. This season has shown how much he has developed with 20 goal contributions in 35 games across all competitions so far. For four seasons, Foden got to play with one of the best strikers in the game, and speaking to Stake, Aguero sang his praises.  “Atletico are always a tough team to beat in the Champions League but I thought City were exceptional on Tuesday night,” the club’s all-time top scorer said. “They dominated the game and could have got more than one goal. Atletico will always make it difficult but City have something to hold onto in Madrid now, which is crucial. “The tie isn’t over because Diego Simeone’s team never give up and they can pull off shock results, especially at home, so City will need to be careful. “Phil Foden is an incredible talent and his assist for Kevin De Bruyne was an example of what he can create out of nowhere.  “He could be the best English talent of his generation. “He has so much quality and it’s easy to forget he is still only 21, with so much time to learn and get better.” 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1

The American hedge fund tycoon has joined forces with Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert and the Ricketts family in an attempt to purchase the London giants.  It is claimed Griffin’s fortune is worth three-times that of departing owner Roman Abramovich, who put the club up for sale on March 2. Chelsea’s directors are soon set to present the UK government with who they want to be the next owner of the club, with the Ricketts family one of the front-runners. The group own the baseball team the Chicago Cubs, and have been joined by Cavaliers owner Gilbert, with Griffin now adding his wealth to the party. And that comes with big promises, as the 53-year-old wants to continue the Blues’ ‘winning tradition’. “I am thrilled to come together with my long-time friends and partners, the Ricketts Family and Dan Gilbert, who have built legendary championship teams,” Griffin said. “All of us love to compete and even more we love to win.  “Our group will work closely together to put the most competitive team on the pitch every year. “If selected, we will validate the trust placed in us to continue Chelsea’s winning tradition while delivering a terrific game day experience for the fans.” Many fans are still opposed to the Ricketts takeover though, with protests outside of Stamford Bridge over their prospective purchase.  The family’s patriarch, Joe Ricketts, was embroiled in a racism storm in 2019 after a string of emails were leaked in which the 80-year-old referred to Muslims as ‘my enemy’. Chelsea’s first ever black player, Paul Canoville, has since spoken to all parties interested in purchasing the club, while the family attempt to distance themselves from the comments, saying Joe will not have any role with the Blues. 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1

It’s been a woeful campaign for the Red Devils, as they sit in seventh in the Premier League, closer to Wolves in eighth, than to Tottenham who occupy the last Champions League spot. A 1-0 loss to relegation-threatened Everton at Goodison Park epitomised the season Man United are having. The defeat now means they have only won once in seven games across all competitions, and they have also gone five seasons without a trophy. On the pitch they have struggled to find the net with only Arsenal scoring fewer in the top seven, and at the back, only Leicester have shipped more goals in the top half of the table. Unless the Red Devils solve both issues, they will be unlikely to finish in the top four. Speaking on the Weekend Sports Breakfast, former Chelsea forward Tony Cascarino spoke about the problems, and said there are issues in the team and questioned the contracts the club hands out to some of the players. He said: “Whether there is an element of young lads who aren’t quite good enough, and the senior players aren’t having them, because that can happen in dressing rooms, and standards that are expected at Man United are way short. “I just don’t feel that’s a group that are united in a way and I think that’s a real concern.  “This feels so weird to watch a Man United team, and I touched on the Burnley performance against Everton in midweek, where a team at the bottom end of the table gave Everton so many problems. “And yet a team of the quality of Man United players [couldn’t cause any problems]. There are a number of Man United players who don’t want to be there. “Some of the players on the contracts that have been given to them would be because of success that they have brought to Man United,” the 59-year-old added. “And it’s not. It’s been either seeing off other clubs, like the [Anthony] Martial deal, that another club might have been interested in Martial so ‘we’ll try to get a transfer fee’, we’re going to sign [him on].  “They’ve signed [on] a number of players to stop other clubs taking them, they tried to do it with Jesse Lingard. “Jesse Lingard, the ridiculous situation of him not being allowed to leave last summer [and in January] and being kept, okay you could argue the Mason Greenwood problem has made Jesse Lingard stay. “But there’s a number of players that are being given new [contracts], Eric Bailly given a new contract. “Dean Henderson given a five-year deal, he’d been really good for Sheffield United on loan and then [went back] to Man United, it now feels Tom Heaton is in front of him as a reserve goalkeeper.  “I don’t get how the club is being run, I don’t understand it,” he continued. “To me it goes against everything that Man United is about, you have to be successful at Manchester United, and to get rewarded with a new contract [you have to earn it]. “United have got caught up in a system where they think ‘we’ll just keep buying players’, but there’s no real plan of how they will all gel together and fit in. “Think of [Edinson] Cavani he’s another one, he signed a year extension, and yes he’s had injuries as well, but that year extension, the moment Ronaldo came in, Cavani now isn’t needed, that’s how it’s felt.  “Who is doing the planning at Man United? What about the coaching staff? That feels like it’s a real mixed bag, I don’t know where they’re going with it. “Mike Phelan has been there for a long time, now Fletcher’s come and is doing a new job. “It feels like everything has not been thought out about the way they’re going ahead with running the club.”  And interim manager Rangnick has said his side won’t be worthy of European qualification if they play as poorly in future matches as they did against Everton. “As long as we play like we did today, we just don’t deserve it,” he said in his post-match press conference. “In order to qualify for Europe you have to be able to score in 95 minutes in the game.” 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1

A spokesperson from the force has appealed for witnesses after ‘it was reported that a boy was assaulted by one of the away team’. Following the match, Ronaldo apologised for his ‘outburst’ on social media after a clip went viral of him appearing to knock something out of a supporter’s hand. The Portugal captain hobbled off the pitch at full-time after revealing a nasty gash on his shin, and then headed down towards the tunnel where the incident then occurred. The 37-year-old appeared to knock an object to the floor as he made his way to the dressing room, with footage of the altercation picked up by multiple cameras. A spokesperson from Merseyside Police said: “We can confirm that we are liaising with Manchester United Football Club and Everton FC following reports of an alleged assault at the Everton v Manchester United football match at Goodison. “As players were leaving the pitch at 2.30pm, it was reported that a boy was assaulted by one of the away team as they left the pitch. “Inquiries are under way and officers are currently working with Everton Football Club to review CCTV footage and are carrying out extensive witness enquiries to establish if an offence has taken place.   “Anyone with information on this incident is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police Contact centre quoting reference number 228 of 9 April 2022.” As clips of the incident began to circulate, Ronaldo apologised to his 424 million followers on Instagram, and openly invited the fan to Old Trafford. “It’s never easy to deal with emotions in difficult moments such as the one we are facing,” Ronaldo wrote. “Nevertheless, we always have to be respectful, patient and set the example for all the youngsters who love the beautiful game.  “I would like to apologise for my outburst and, if possible, I would like to invite this supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford as a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship.” Manchester United have also released a statement after it was reported that they were ‘looking into’ the matter. “We are aware of an alleged incident after today’s game at Everton and the club will cooperate with any police inquiries,” a club spokesperson said. 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1

Mykolenko starred at left-back, putting in a solid display to help Everton overcome Manchester United 1-0, and then was left speechless by the act of generosity. The 22-year-old hails from Cherkasy in central Ukraine, and has received huge support from the Everton crowd following Russia’s invasion of his home country. The Russian military entered Ukraine on February 24, and two days later Mykolenko and international teammate Oleksandr Zinchenko were left in tears as fans and teammates gave the duo their backing before Everton took on Manchester City. Mykolenko didn’t feature in that match, but has played every minute of action in Everton’s last three fixtures, and was again left moved by the support he’s received on Merseyside. Following the victory Mykolenko posted a card he was given by a club steward called Tommy, which contained money to be donated to Ukraine. In the Instagram post, Mykolenko wrote: “Today after the game I received a letter from steward Tommy, which fell into my heart and I had no words when I opened it. “I hope Tommy will not take offense at me for this post.  A post shared by Vitalii Mykolenko (@mikola_16) “I want to thank once again this man with a big heart who is trying to help my homeland and all people who are not indifferent Glory to Ukraine.” The letter read: ‘SLAVA UKRAINE’ [glory to Ukraine] ‘Please donate this to help a fellow country person from Ukraine!’ ‘Tommy x’ ",positive,liverpool,0

A 2-1 loss to Brighton at the Emirates severely dented the club’s Champions League hopes and their defeat was amplified after Tottenham’s emphatic win against Aston Villa. For the first time since December, the Gunners have suffered back-to-back defeats in the league, succumbing to a heavy loss against Crystal Palace on Monday night. With the two results not going their way, Arteta’s side have relinquished fourth place to their bitter rivals. Significantly, even though they still have a game in hand over Spurs, a win would not necessarily put Arsenal back above them due to an inferior goal difference. Eight games remain for them to try and secure their return to Europe’s premier competition, and whilst they are in a poor vein of form right now, are certainly not out of the conversation. A crunch tie against Spurs on May 12 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium could well go a long way to deciding who finishes in fourth. But Arteta needs to rebuild his players’ confidence and it’s something former Premier League star Darren Ambrose believes they won’t have much of right now.  “I just felt the last two games for Arsenal, they’ve taken a real knock,” the former Crystal Palace midfielder said on talkSPORT. “Particularly against Crystal Palace, I sat here with Andy Goldstein and said ‘Crystal Palace will win that game’. “And it wasn’t because of my association with Palace, I just felt that Arsenal are not strong enough.  “They can’t go through the whole season, in my opinion, with the squad they have. “They have some great players, Saka, Martinelli, Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, and Lacazette’s come into the team. “They’re still young, they’re a young squad. A few weeks ago I said they were potentially forward for the top four. They were three points above Spurs, couple of games on Spurs, three games in hand on Manchester United. “But they’ve just taken a real hit at the worst possible time.”  Following the game, Arteta spoke about his feelings about the match and said his players deserve criticism coming their way. “What happens is we criticise ourselves a lot again, get slapped again because we deserve it and then lift ourselves up,” the Spaniard said. “It has been a tough week; especially today because we wanted a reaction [to the defeat at Crystal Palace]. “It came in the second half, which is too late; we have to have the courage and personality to play much better and raise the level in the first half.  “We made it really difficult for ourselves. We were sloppy, we had no purpose to attack, we were really imprecise and we didn’t want to play forward. “We’ve shown for many weeks how well we can play; it has been a difficult week and we’ve lost some big players, but if you get what you want, not everything is going to be with a blue sky. “This is our team in the good moments and especially the defeats. There are many games to play but we have to be concerned about that performance, especially first half. “We know this road is taking us nowhere, especially with where we want to be. “We have everything to play for in the last eight games and we have to have that energy and visualise the beautiful challenge that we have ahead and not sit back and see what happens.” 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1

He also invited the fan involved in the incident to watch a game at Old Trafford “as a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship”. “It’s never easy to deal with emotions in difficult moments such as the one we are facing,” he wrote on Instagram. “Nevertheless, we always have to be respectful, patient and set the example for all the youngsters who love the beautiful game. “I would like to apologize for my outburst and, if possible, I would like to invite this supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford as a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship.” A post shared by Cristiano Ronaldo (@cristiano) Ronaldo had returned to United’s starting line-up and played the full 90 minutes of the defeat. Anthony Gordon’s deflected strike decided the match at Goodison, likely condemning United to a season without Champions League football. The club are now six points from Tottenham who enhanced their chances of finishing fourth in the Premier League by beating Aston Villa. United goalkeeper David de Gea called his side’s display a ‘disgrace’ post-match, and manager Ralf Rangnick agreed, but it was Ronaldo who made the headlines for the off-field incident. The legendary goalscorer had already limped off the pitch following the final whistle, sporting a nasty gash on his shin which was picked up by the cameras. He looked in pain as he entered the Goodison tunnel to head to the dressing room when the altercation with a supporter occurred.  ",negative,liverpool,0

January signing Dejan Kulusevski bagged the other goal in a dominant win, with the Swede continuing to shine alongside Son and Harry Kane in an unstoppable front three.  Son gave Spurs an early lead when he guided in a Kane rebound inside three minutes, but it was Villa who dominated the first half. “It’s been the Hugo Lloris show,” said talkSPORT’s Dean Ashton on commentary, but Son soon stole the headlines. Kulusevski doubled Spurs’ lead straight after the break and then Son ran riot with two more sublime finishes. “Tottenham on the break, just scintillating honestly,” said Ashton. “The movement, the interchanging of positions, the quality of the finishing as well. “They’re going to be hard to beat in this form.” Spurs are now three points ahead of Arsenal in the race for a top four finish with the Gunners losing 2-1 against Brighton earlier in the day. It previously looked like Mikel Arteta was in control of Arsenal’s return to Europe’s top tier competition, but it’s now Conte’s Spurs who are in the ascendancy, with Son to thank.  The Korean fired in a perfect first-time effort in off the post, and Kulusevski matched his accuracy by somehow finding a way past Emi Martinez with a tight-angle shot. A deft flick-on from Kane then set Son away for his second, before Kulusevski showed how at home he is flanking the two Spurs superstars, setting Son up for a hat-trick. “They were up there with the confident Manchester City and Liverpool in the way that they played in that second half,” said Ashton. “They were superb, they’ve come a long way in the space of four or five weeks, and they’re starting to look like the complete outfit.” 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,2

A deflected first-half strike from academy graduate Anthony Gordon decided the match, helping Lampard’s side recover from a destressing midweek loss to Burnley.  The 3-2 defeat at Turf Moor last time out sucked Everton straight into the midst of a relegation battle, but they’ve since responded to move four points clear of the bottom three with a game more played. Lampard’s record at Everton still doesn’t make great reading since his January arrival with three wins and seven defeats in 10 league games, but home form has been a comfort. The Chelsea legend now has three wins from five league games at Goodison Park, and he was keen to acknowledge the crowd’s role in an important home victory. When asked by talkSPORT what the result meant, Lampard said: “Three points, we need more of that so won’t get carried away but we’ve been good here at Goodison. “My time here we’ve got five wins in the seven games [in all competitions], we don’t concede, we fight, the crowd get with us and we create something a bit special like today. “We just need to go again with that, the next game’s at home and we’ve not yet strung wins together in the league, so I’m really happy with how the whole stadium was, it was another special one but we’ve got more to do, I’m not jumping up and down because there is a lot more to do.”  Lampard felt his side were judged harshly after a chaotic defeat to Burnley, where they found themselves 2-1 up before being out-gunned. But a visibly delighted Everton boss was over-the-moon with his side’s recovery and ability to shrug off what could have been a catastrophic loss. “We didn’t deserve to lose against Burnley,” he explained. “The biggest thing today was the character of picking ourselves up. “Thursday morning it feels horrible, Friday morning not so bad, Saturday morning you go again against Man United, so that’s why I’m proud of the players and the fans.  “We were all very upbeat, fighting until the last minute, and at the minute that’s the difference a little bit. “We’ve got to deal with the away stuff but at the minute the football basics are much more important than the pretty patterns, it’s the fight and the tackles and the running that are going to keep us up. “We’re not soft. As much as we bemoan the stakes late in the game at Burnley, when you get in that position here with a high level team such as Manchester United, they’ve only got to get the ball one time through your midfield and you’ve got people like [Cristiano] Ronaldo and [Bruno] Fernandes running at your back four, you have to manage the game. “As I say, we’re in a moment now where that side of the game is more important than the beautiful side so well managed by the lads.”  United outshot Everton 12-7 during the match, with four efforts to three on target, and Lampard was delighted with Jordan Pickford’s ability to snub out any potential threats. Asked about Pickford’s impact, Lampard said: “Big, big, he’s England’s number one. “He’s a pleasure to work with Jordan, I have to say, and the scrutiny that comes with that role as England’s number one is big. “The saves he makes, I don’t think they were amazing chances the first two but they were really good saves and the Ronaldo one, with our luck recently you expect that to bulge the net. “You need to rely on your keeper, top goalkeepers are a big deal, they win you points and save you points and Jordan did it today.” 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1

A deflected strike from Anthony Gordon gave the hosts victory, a defeat interim manager Ralf Rangnick also admitted could see the Red Devils struggle to finish in the Premier League’s top-six. Even though the visitors started brightly, and had 68 percent possession,  the Toffees were largely untroubled in the contest and Frank Lampard’s men secured a huge boost in their quest to avoid relegation. Rangnick’s side were slow on the ball, and rarely got in behind the Everton defence. Because of that, they succumbed to defeat, and have now won just once in their last seven games in all competitions. Champions League football is looking more and more unlikely and De Gea echoed those thoughts at full time. “It is a disgrace from us, we should be winning this game,” he said to BT Sport. “We don’t score but we don’t even create proper chances to score. I don’t know what to say, to be honest.  “We knew before today they were struggling and how difficult it was going to be. “We are not good enough, that is for sure. It will be difficult to be in the top four. “They played Wednesday [Everton’s 3-2 defeat to Burnley] and they were tired but they had more desire than us, that is not acceptable. Very sad to lose today.” Rangnick also spoke about his side’s chances of qualifying for the Champions League next season, and said even finishing in the top-six could be a stretch for the out-of-form Red Devils. “Not a good one,” when asked about the impact of the result.  “When you don’t win your own games, and drop points, it will be difficult to finish in the top-four, maybe even in the top-six. “We had a good start, the first 25 minutes we were dominating the game, not always making and taking the right decisions, but what we had intended to play, had played in the first 25 minutes, and [we] should have scored. “They defended with the whole team, they had almost all their ten outfield players around their own box. “And in order to break that wall down you need to have more players in the box, and bring crosses into the box, whenever we did that in the two or three moments, we [created] some big chances, and this should have happened more often.” 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1
21,https://talksport.com/football/1074493/chelsea-transfer-news-tottenham-barcelona-christensen-kessie/,Chelsea and Tottenham set for disappointment as Barcelona confirm they have signed two players expected to be Franck Kessie and Andreas Christensen,"Barcelona president Joan Laporta has all-but announced the capture of Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen and AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessie. Both players are out of contract this summer and have been free to open talks with clubs oversees.  “We’ve completed two signings for the next season,’ the Camp Nou chief toldRAC1 in Spain. “One is a midfielder, the other one is a centre back. But I’m not allowed to mention their names.” Journalist Fabrizio Romano, who specialises in the transfer market, later tweeted, writing: “Of course, Franck Kessie and Andreas Christensen deals are both fully agreed.” Chelsea were keen to keep hold of Denmark international Christensen, who has been heavily linked with a move to Barcelona since January. The move to Catalonia for the 25-year-old will end his 10-year association with the Blues. Christensen made the move to Stamford Bridge as a 15-year-old from Danish giants Brondby in 2012, and has managed to get his hands on multiple honours, including last seasons Champions League.  Barça president Laporta confirms: ""We've completed two signings for the next season: one is a midfielder, the other one is a centre-back. But I'm not allowed to mention their names"". ✍🏻📑 #FCB Of course, Franck Kessié and Andreas Christensen deals are both fully agreed. He has, however, only made one appearance this season, but has been blighted by injuries and COVID-19. Meanwhile, Tottenham were previously linked with a move for Kessie as they look to bolster their midfield. It seems Spurs boss Antonio Conte will now have to look elsewhere for midfield recruits. Barcelona stepped up their interested in the Ivory Coast international as soon as the star made it clear his intentions was not to remain in Milan. Kessie, who is eyed as long-term replacement for Barca stalwart Sergio Busquets, has impressed since arriving at the Serie A side from rivals Atalanta in 2019. In more than 200 appearances in red and black, he has scored 35 goals in the process and contributed to 16 assists. Barca have made their intentions clear and they are keen to strengthen further, with boss Xavi expected to bring in more recruits this summer, with RB Leipzig’s Dani Olmo a key target. 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1
22,https://talksport.com/football/1060689/chelsea-owner-roman-abramovich-sanctioned-uk-government-russia-ukraine-transfer-news-stamford-bridge/,"What Roman Abramovich’s sanctions mean for Chelsea: No tickets sold, closed club shop, no transfers and no new contracts","Chelsea have, in effect, found themselves in limbo following confirmation that owner Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the UK Government. The Russian, who has a net worth of around $12.9billion, recently announced he is looking to sell the Premier League club amid news of his nation’s invasion of Ukraine and the war being raged by president Vladimir Putin in eastern Europe. Several Russian billionaire oligarchs have been sanctioned by the UK government and now Abramovich has, too. It will have huge implications for him as well as Chelsea Football Club and their fans moving forward this season. All of Abramovich’s UK assets have been frozen and while Chelsea can still operate under a special licence, the sale of the Premier League club will now have to be put on hold. In addition to the Blues, he has a London property portfolio of £200m, including a 15-bedroom mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens, valued at more than £150m, and a three-storey penthouse at Chelsea Waterfront acquired in 2018 for a reported £22m. The news will also impact Chelsea in several other ways and are wide-ranging, meaning all the club’s teams, including Emma Hayes’ highly-successful women’s side, are affected. Here’s what the action taken against Abramovich means for Chelsea… The current licence does not permit Abramovich to sell the club, which had been his stated intention. However, it’s understood the Government would consider an application for a new licence to allow the sale of the club, provided it is demonstrated he would not benefit in any way from that sale. He has previously said the proceeds of any sale would go to support the people of Ukraine. The club can still receive money from other clubs for existing loan or player sale arrangements. Television revenue and performance fees can still be paid to the club. A document issued by the Treasury states the club can continue to pay the salaries, allowances and pensions of all employees. Fees, dividends and other allowances to directors which pre-date the licence can be paid, with the exception of anything due to Abramovich. Fees related to the day-to-day maintenance of club facilities can be paid, but no money can go towards new capital works or refurbishment of Stamford Bridge or any other club-owned sites.  Chelsea will effectively be under a transfer embargo moving forward and will currently not be able to conduct business in the transfer market this summer. They will also be unable to confirm new contracts for their players. Antonio Rudiger, Andreas Christensen and Cesar Azpilicueta are among numerous stars whose deals expire this summer. Several other Chelsea players will see their contracts run out in 2023 including N’Golo Kante, Jorginho, Ross Barkley, Thiago Silva, Marcos Alonso and Kenedy. Chelsea will now have to play their home games with reduced crowds as the club will not be allowed to sell any more tickets. Only season ticket holders will be permitted to attend games for the foreseeable future. Chelsea have around 28,000 season ticket holders while Stamford Bridge holds just under 42,000. Fans who have already purchased tickets to future matches will be able to attend. Fees of up to £500,000 for hosting any Chelsea match can be paid for security, stewarding and so on.  The club will not be allowed to sell merchandise but catering services at the stadium will be permitted. Third parties who purchased or produced club merchandise prior to March 10 are permitted to sell existing stocks, on the condition that no funds or other financial benefits are made available to the club or Abramovich. Chelsea’s shirt sponsor, telecommunications company Three, has placed the deal under review. A company spokesperson said: “We are in discussions with Chelsea and reviewing our position.” The three-year deal was announced in January 2020, with the company logos appearing on shirts from the start of last season.  Travel costs for any match played by a team representing Chelsea will be capped at £20,000. That immediately raises the issue of how the men’s team will be able to fulfil future Champions League away ties beyond next week’s last-16 second leg against Lille. The club are obliged to keep records of any activity permitted under the special licence awarded to the club to continue in business with a value exceeding £5,000 for a minimum of six years. The licence expires on May 31 and the Treasury reserves the right to vary, revoke or suspend it at any time. The core principle of the licence is to deny access to revenue, beyond what the club needs to operate on a day-to-day basis.  The club have released the following statement: “Chelsea Football Club has been advised that its owner Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the UK Government. “By virtue of his 100 per cent ownership of Chelsea FC plc and affiliated entities, Chelsea FC would normally be subject to the same sanctions regime as Mr Abramovich. However, the UK Government has issued a general licence that permits Chelsea FC to continue certain activities.“We will fulfil our men’s and women’s team fixtures today against Norwich and West Ham, respectively, and intend to engage in discussions with the UK Government regarding the scope of the licence. “This will include seeking permission for the licence to be amended in order to allow the Club to operate as normal as possible. We will also be seeking guidance from the UK Government on the impact of these measures on the Chelsea Foundation and its important work in our communities.“The club will update further when it is appropriate.”  Ex-Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan has explained how Chelsea can still be sold to new owners. He told talkSPORT: “There’s an alternative set of arguments to that because Abramovich has also half-circumvented that; he’s already made a declaration that none of the proceeds of the sale will go anywhere near him, they’ll go to a fund for the victims of the Ukrainian invasion. “Of course people are saying, ‘what do those victims look like’, is it the Ukrainians, is it the Russian soldiers, but putting that to one side, if Abramovich is not receiving one penny of these proceeds and there’s a ring-fencing mechanism for the people who are disposing of it, I don’t see any reason why this sale would be stopped. “As long as the government can ascertain that Abramovich does not receive one single ruble, pound, euro or whatever currency it’ll be paid in, then I don’t see how some of the sensational headlines that will flow about the suspending of the sale of this football club will actually manifest themselves in reality.” Meanwhile, Government ministers have been quick to insist any damage on Chelsea would be limited. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said on Twitter: “Our priority is to hold those who have enabled the Putin regime to account. “Today’s sanctions obviously have a direct impact on Chelsea and its fans. We have been working hard to ensure the club & the national game are not unnecessarily harmed by these important sanctions. “To ensure the club can continue to compete and operate we are issuing a special licence that will allow fixtures to be fulfilled, staff to be paid and existing ticket holders to attend matches while, crucially, depriving Abramovich of benefiting from his ownership of the club. “I know this brings some uncertainty, but the Government will work with the league and clubs to keep football being played while ensuring sanctions hit those intended. Football clubs are cultural assets and the bedrock of our communities. We’re committed to protecting them.” ",positive,liverpool,0
23,https://talksport.com/football/1082132/diogo-jota-name-change-reason-liverpool-silva-wolves/,The real story behind Diogo Jota’s name change and fascinating reason why Liverpool star was known as ‘Silva’ at Wolves,"Diogo Jota is a name on every Liverpool fan’s lips at the moment. But what many supporters may not realise is that Jota, as he is now almost universally known, is actually just a childhood nickname. The Portuguese forward was named the best centre-forward in the Premier League earlier this season as a result of his stunning form. The 25-year-old is currently second in the goal scoring charts in England’s top-flight only behind team-mate Mohamed Salah. Liverpool’s No. 20 has proved a revelation since his £41million move from Wolves in September 2020. But interestingly, the name Jota, while ever-present on every kit since his arrival at Anfield, was not always adorned on the back of his shirt at Molineux. So where did it come from and why did he change it? talkSPORT.com has all you need to know…  He was actually born Diogo Jose Teixeira da Silva but supposedly chose to go by ‘Diogo J’ as a youngster to differentiate himself from other Diogo’s and Silva’s in his youth academy. Case in point, his brother Andre, currently at Gondomar, kept the family name and could easily be mistaken for RB Leipzig striker Andre Silva. The name Jota is simply the Portuguese pronunciation of the letter J. The language uses a hard J, which is slightly different from Spanish dialects who would instead pronounce such a name ‘Hota’ – as was the case with former Aston Villa midfielder Jota!  The attacker began his career with Portuguese outfit Pacos de Ferreira before he was signed by Atletico Madrid in 2016. He spent the 2016/17 campaign on loan at Porto under Nuno Espirito Santo before he followed his compatriot to Wolves the next season. At the time, the west Midlanders were in the Championship and EFL regulations meant players had to go by their surnames on their shirts. This meant Jota briefly went a term with Silva on his back before reverting to ‘Diogo J.’ upon Wolves’ return to the Premier League in 2018. That is part of his surname. Jota is just a nickname he has become known by. 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,3

The Dutch giants are anticipating a formal offer from United to pay the £1.7 compensation requited to release Ten Hag from his contract. Along withMauricio Pochettino, the Dutchman was regarded as one of the favourites to succeed interim bossRalf Rangnick, and he now looks to have beaten the former Tottenham boss to the Red Devils job. talkSPORT understands Ten Hag was interviewed for the Old Trafford job last month. Paris Saint-Germain’s disappointing Champions League exit, having been 2-0 ahead against Real Madrid, is said to have not helped Pochettino’s cause. Luis Enrique andSevilla’s Julen Lopetegui were also reportedly considered, whilst Chelsea’s Thomas Tuchel andBayern Munich’s Julian Nagelsmann were also ruled out. It was reported, after his interview, that Ten Hag impressed Man United chiefs with his vision and philosophy, something which helped Ajax to a Champions League semi-final in 2019. He will be hoping to repeat that feat if he takes over at Man United, but reaching the final four of the continent’s biggest club competition is something they’ve not done since 2011.  The Old Trafford hierarchy will also be hoping their reported new boss can bring them their first league title since 2013, something he has done twice during his time in the Eredivisie. Ten Hag has a history of developing young players and playing exciting football at Ajax and, if he can do that and deliver trophies at United too, he is sure to become an instant hit at Old Trafford. It’s reported Ten Hag is already laying down the groundwork to build a Man United team in his image with the Dutchman understood to be keen on signing Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves. Meanwhile, former Man United assistant manager Steve McClaren has been linked with a sensational return to the club to work as Ten Hag’s assistant. The pair worked together at FC Twente, however, McClaren was the manager while Ten Hag was assistant boss. 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1

Following on from a fine performance as England captain against Ivory Coast in midweek, the City ace helped his domestic side to another win as the title race heats up. Sterling grabbed two assists as City beat Burnley 2-0 to keep themselves ahead of Liverpool in the Premier League table by one point. And as he prepares to going head-to-head with his former club next Sunday, he’s been compared to opposite number Mohamed Salah. The England ace has scored 10 league goals and claimed three assists, while the Reds forward has an impressive 20 strikes and laid on 10 for teammates. But former Premier League striker Tony Cascarino reckons, all considered, Sterling has actually been better than the Egyptian across the whole campaign. “Raheem Sterling has just been frightening. The year he has had since the Euros – he was brilliant then,” he told the Weekend Sports Breakfast. “This season, I thought, when they signed Jack Grealish I though Raheem might be a bit part player in this City team but he’s become an absolute permanent fixture. Left or right, he is ripping people apart.   “He was brilliant for England in midweek. Raheem is playing the best football of his career. Better than he was at Liverpool and better than at anytime at City.” He added: “Mohamed Salah was fantastic at the start of the season. At the AFCON he didn’t play so well and he’s had a few tricky times in international football and he’s not played as well in the last month or two. “If I’m taking from the start of the season, and even going back to the Euros, I can’t think of a player that has played better than Raheem Sterling.” 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,4

Goals from Leandro Trossard and Enock Mwepu gave Graham Potter’s side all three points for the first time in eight Premier League games. Martin Odegaard gave his side hope when his effort from 30 yards was deflected by Danny Welbeck, which looped the ball over goalkeeper Robert Sanchez. But it was not enough for the hosts, who will be left fuming over VAR after having an equaliser on the stroke of half-time ruled out after a lengthy delay. After a damaging result on Monday night against Crystal Palace, the Gunners had to win this game to get their top-four hopes back on track. Prior to kick-off, a point would have been enough for Arsenal to go back in the final spot above fierce rivals Tottenham, even for a few hours. But from the first minute, Mikel Arteta’s side never looked like they brushed off the defeat at Selhurst Park and if anyone looked like taking a lead, it was the Seagulls. Chances were few and far between in the first 25 minutes, but the game finally came to life on the half-hour mark.  With first choice left-back Kieran Tiernay out for the rest of the season, Arteta opted to deploy defensive midfielder Granit Xhaka in that position. Whilst Xhaka has certain abilities, pace is not one of them, and it was on display for the opener. A clearance from Lewis Dunk found Mwepu, and for some reason the Switzerland captain was not in line with the rest of his back four. With a gaping hole in his position, the 24-year-old Zambian exploited the space and after proceeding into the penalty area, he cut the ball back to Trossard who unleashed an unstoppable strike into the top right corner past Aaron Ramsdale. It was a fantastic goal from the visitors, but one that could have been avoidable had Xhaka been in the right position. Finding themselves 1-0 down again, Arsenal’s character was tested, and they didn’t look like showing much of that for the remainder of the first half.  However, on the stroke of half-time, it looked like the hosts got out of jail. An in-swinging corner from Bukayo Saka found Gabriel at the far post, he knocked it across goal and, a few yards out, Gabriel Martinelli had the simple task of heading the ball into an empty net. It was a huge relief for everyone in the ground other than the Brighton fans, but just as the hosts thought they got back on terms, VAR intervened. After a lengthy check from the officials, the Brazilian was adjudged to be offside.  Whilst the correct decision was made, it was another frustrating wait for fans as they were made to wait. And speaking on talkSPORT, former West Ham centre-back Alvin Martin was extremely critical for how long it took for a call to be made. “I’m not a fan i don’t think any of us are, it’s ridiculous really,” “I think it’s taken a massive part of the game away, VAR, he has got it right, but at the cost of what to the game? “Not just this game, but every game.”  Much of the second half was a replica of the first, and to sum up Arsenal’s woes, Saka was correctly booked for simulation. The hosts’ misery was then compounded when Brighton doubled their lead just after the hour mark with an incredible team goal. On the left channel, Marc Cucurella played the ball into Moises Caicedo who gave it Trossard, his wonderful flick returned the ball to the Ecuadorian and he cut the ball back to Mwepu. 20 yards out, the Zambian produced a wonderful side-footed effort into the bottom left.  Arsenal tried to get back into it, and could have even snatched a point at the end after Odegaard’s strike made it 2-1 just before the clock hit 90 minutes. But they couldn’t test Sanchez again as Arsenal’s top four hopes suffer a major dent. 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1

It was a massive victory for Frank Lampard’s side who bounced back from defeat to Burnley as Anthony Gordon’s deflected strike was enough to claim all three points. For the Red Devils though, it was another less than average display as their top four chances and hopes of sealing Champions League qualification took a massive dent. It’s now one win in seven games in all competitions for Ralf Rangnick’s side and, based on the display today, they will find it hard to win many more games this term. However, they did start well as Everton looked nervy in the opening exchanges. Cristiano Ronaldo, back in the starting eleven after missing the 1-1 draw against Leicester through illness, produced a shot that went just wide of Jordan Pickford’s post. Moments later, Marcus Rashford forced a good save from his England teammate when leaping high to get on the end of a Bruno Fernandes cross. Speaking on commentary, former Man City winger Trevor Sinclair was full of praise for the shot stopper.  “Excellent save, really good header, a lot of pace on the ball so he didn’t have to do much, but great save from Pickford,” he said. But the visitors didn’t make the most of the early pressure, and were made to pay midway through the first half. Richarlison received the ball from Gordon, proceeded to cut inside from the left channel, and laid the ball back to Alex Iwobi. He spun on the ball, and via a touch from Nemanja Matic, the ball broke to the academy star who shot, and the ball found the net with a shot that took a massive deflection from Harry Maguire. The Toffees fans were understandably delirious and this win could be massive in their bid to secure Premier League football for another season.  For as good as Lampard’s side were – the legend claiming his first league win over the Red Devils as a manager – Man United were very poor, and rarely threatened the Toffees goal. Whilst dominating possession, 68 percent to be precise, they rarely got in behind the Everton defence. And it was something Sinclair was very critical of. “Manchester United look a shadow of their former selves,” said the talkSPORT pundit. “They’re getting bullied by Everton, Manchester United players do not look interested in this game. “This Manchester United team has got no discipline, they’re absolutely losing the plot today.”  And that woeful display was epitomised by the performance of Ronaldo who, other than a shot in the final minutes of the match which Pickford saved, did not threaten much. Sinclair added: “Cristiano Ronaldo has hardly been in the game, he started well and had a shot but I can’t remember saying his name much since”. The visitors’ display showcased how much work the next manager – which is looking like Ajax boss Erik ten Hag – has to do. On the flip side, Lampard will hope this scalp gives his team a much needed confidence boost for their remaining eight matches as they look to avoid what would be an embarrassing relegation. 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1
30,https://talksport.com/football/1078040/brentford-chelsea-christian-eriksen-goals-highlights/,Brentford humiliate Chelsea at Stamford Bridge with Christian Eriksen among scorers as he nets first Premier League goal since cardiac arrest,"Brentford secured an astonishing 4-1 win at Chelsea on Saturday as Christian Eriksen scored his first Premier League goal since suffering his cardiac arrest. The Bees stunned Stamford Bridge with a remarkable second-half turnaround as they came from behind to flip the game on its head, and then some. There were protests outside the stadium before kick-off as hundreds of Chelsea fans gathered to make their point against a potential takeover by the Ricketts family. When the game got underway, it was Brentford who started more brightly as Chelsea underwhelmed in the first 45. Regardless, the two sides went in 0-0 at half-time and it wasn’t until the start of the second period that the game exploded into life. Antonio Rudiger broke the deadlock on 48 minutes, lashing home a long-range strike to hand Chelsea the lead. The German defender had tried time and again to hit the net from distance in the past and finally produced the goods with a marvellous effort.   However, Vitaly Janelt equalised almost immediately to draw Brentford back level. The hosts let collective minds linger on Rudiger’s goal and the Bees capitalised to sneak through, with Janelt providing a smart finish. By the 54th minute, the visitors had turned the game around. Eriksen tapped home from Bryan Mbeumo’s square ball to put Brentford 2-1 up.   Mbeumo’s rapid break caught Chelsea on the back foot and the Bees forward took full advantage of the defensive disarray to tee up a straightforward finish for Eriksen. Then, remarkably, Brentford scored again to go 3-1 up on the hour mark. Janelt tiptoed in behind the Chelsea defence once more and dinked home as the away side caught their hosts out three times in quick succession, leaving Stamford Bridge in shock. The Blues failed to reduce the deficit in the final 30 minutes and Brentford sealed a magnificent win over their London rivals in the closing stages. More calamitous defending, this time a woeful attempted clearance from Rudiger, allowed Yoane Wissa a simple goal to cement a 4-1 victory – Brentford’s first win over Chelsea since 1939. 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1

The 28-year-old still remains under contract with Liverpool and posted a picture of his new frame with the caption ‘An afternoon well spent’ accompanied by a strong muscle emoji.  Whilst working out, the German showed off showed off his shredded physique similar to that of Fernando Torres. An extraordinarily buff looking Torres was spotted patrolling the touchline as his Atletico Madrid side beat Liverpool in the UEFA Youth League earlier in the season. The Spaniard has clearly spent a lot of time working on his new muscular physique. Karius, meanwhile, had a slim build when playing regularly for the Reds as their no.1, and now his arms appear huge due to the intense training. The former Mainz goalkeeper joined the Merseyside giants in 2016 and made 49 appearances under Jurgen Klopp. He has since, however, failed to make a single appearance for the club since his calamitous display in the 2018 Champions League final against Real Madrid.  Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema scored the goals thanks to errors from the then first choice goalie. He later apologised to fans after the final whistle, but suffered mentally when, inexcusably, he received death threats on social media in the aftermath. It spelled the end to his career at Anfield, and the goalkeeper made the move to Turkish giants Besiktas on a two-year loan switch. Liverpool then secured the services of Alisson from Roma, and after Karius’ loan move to Turkey was cut short, he joined Union Berlin where he made just five appearances in the Bundesliga. Now, he remains on Merseyside, but is four choice goalkeeper at the club, behind Alisson, Caoimhin Kelleher and Spaniard Adrian, with his contract up this summer.  888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,4

Kevin De Bruyne ended 70 minutes of typically-stubborn resistance from Diego Simeone’s men, slotting the ball home after a brilliant assist from substitute Phil Foden.  The LaLiga side will now be forced to try and score in the second leg, a thought they barely entertained on Tuesday night as Pep Guardiola’s side dominated the game. Nevertheless, City were forced to wait 55 minutes for a shot on target as Simeone threatening to produce yet another defensive masterclass in Europe, with the visitors occasionally looking dangerous on the break. However, Foden proved the difference, creating the decisive moment within seconds of emerging from the bench, turning and finding De Bruyne with a clever slide rule pass. The Belgian fired an inch-perfect finish across Jan Oblak – before Atletico started resorting to the dark arts for which they have become infamous.   Substitute Jack Grealish was their chosen target – and his treatment sparked a furious reaction from Guardiola when Angel Correa smashed the ball at the Englishman as he lay on the ground. Things threatened to boil over at full-time between a dismayed Grealish and the Atletico players, as Simeone headed straight down the tunnel without shaking his opposite number’s hand. But with Atletico outclassed in every sense of the word, the Argentine will need a new plan of attack at the Wanda Metropolitano next Wednesday to stop City progressing to the semi-finals. 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1

Chelsea’s directors, in tandem with American bank Raine Group, are set to present to the UK government on who they want to be the next owner of the club. It’s been suggested the Ricketts family, who are owners of the baseball team Chicago Cubs, are frontrunners to be given the keys to Stamford Bridge. Fellow American Ken Griffin is understood to be part of their consortium. Griffin is understood to be worth £21.7bn, meaning his wealth somewhat dwarfs Abramovich. “The people that are coming to town are very wealthy,” Times journalist Matt Lawton told Hawksbee and Jacobs. “Ken Griffin, who’s come in as part of the Ricketts group, makes Roman Abramovich look relatively poor. He’s understood to be worth £21.7billion. “There are some big hitters coming in, there’s a lot of money in this group. It’s not often that Roman Abramovich won’t be the richest man in the room.” The bidders are understood to be in London to make their pitch to Chelsea directors Eugene Tenenbaum and Marina Granovskaia as well as chairman Bruce Buck, and Lawton shed further details into how the bidding process will work.  “They all have their allotted times to meet the same three people, and other people, and quiz them on the business and what they’re proposing to buy,” Lawton added. “If they’re looking to spend the best part of £3billion they’re obviously going to sit down with the people that run the club at the moment and scrutinise everything they’re doing. “You’ve got this weird situation where they’re going to be interviewing each other. But I imagine the bidding groups won’t want to give them too hard a grilling because that could affect their chances of winning the race! “The whole thing is curious I have to say.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Prior to the Blues’ Premier League clash with Brentford, supporters made their feelings clear about the controversial ownership bid. Some of the signs at #cfc fan protest against Ricketts family pic.twitter.com/TsKfbu2mXX The Chicago Cubs owners are among thecandidatesto take over the club from Roman Abramovich. But Chelsea fans are calling for Americans’ bid to be rejected due to alleged racist comments made by the family’s patriarch, Joe Ricketts. He was accused of Islamophobia in 2019, after a string of emails were leaked. Supporters previously had the hashtag ‘NoToRicketts’ trending on Twitter, while also raising concerns with the club and online with a petition against the bid reaching over 20,000 signatures. And on Saturday hundreds protested in person outside Stamford Bridge. Chants of, “F*** off the Ricketts, you’re not wanted here,” rang out as various placards were held up to ram home the point.  The Ricketts family have moved to insist they do not accept any kind of racism or hatred. Joe Ricketts is not involved in the Ricketts family bid, with their candidacy led by Chicago Cubs chairman Tom. Tom Ricketts confirmed meetings with the Chelsea Supporters’ Trust, and pledged to sit down with more fans in a bid to prove his family’s suitability to take over at the west London club. “Over the past fortnight, our bid team has met with several supporter groups to explain our vision for Chelsea Football Club,” said Tom Ricketts in a statement on Saturday. “In those meetings, and by letter to all groups, we have shared a set of specific commitments we will make to fans, if our bid is successful. “We believe these are far-reaching and certainly include an absolute commitment on the part of the Ricketts family and the bid team to put diversity and inclusion at the heart of the club. “We look forward to more meetings – including with the Chelsea Supporters’ Trust – over the coming days and to making a public reiteration of our values and commitments.”  The CST issued their own statement on Saturday, insisting its membership ‘neither supports nor has confidence in’ the Ricketts family’s bid. The influential Chelsea fan group conducted a snap survey of members, with 77 per cent of those polled claiming not to support their offer. “At present, it is clear that our membership neither supports nor has confidence in the Ricketts family’s bid for the club,” read the CST statement. “This is reflective of wider concerns articulated by large, vocal sections of Chelsea’s supporter base. “The CST Board is guided by our membership, and thus we do not currently believe it is in the best interests of our members for the Ricketts family’s bid to succeed. “We await further public detail from the Ricketts family on concrete steps they will take to address the well-documented concerns of Chelsea supporters. “Should the Ricketts publicly set out clear and detailed plans on how they will address support concerns, we may survey our members again in the next week.” 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1
35,https://talksport.com/football/1081694/ricketts-family-chelsea-takeover-talks-discrimination-bigotry/,Ricketts family have Chelsea takeover talks and aim to assure fans they will fight discrimination and bigotry,"Prospective Chelsea owners the Ricketts family are looking to assure the club’s fans they will fight discrimination and bigotry if they are selected to buy the club from Roman Abramovich. The Chicago Cubs owners have been in London for talks about a deal with Blues chiefs, including chairman Bruce Buck. Laura Ricketts, America’s only gay sports franchise director, has been using the visit to talk with various parties involved with club. Her aim has been to allay fears over their bid after criticism from Blues fans for historic racist comments from her father. In leaked e-mails in 2019 Joe Ricketts branded Muslims ‘my enemy’ but he will not have any role if they family do takeover at Stamford Bridge. Cubs co-owner Tom Ricketts has described his father’s comments as ‘abhorrent’, with the Major League Baseball side building strong links with Muslim communities in the US. Meanwhile, Laura revealed positive meetings with Chelsea LGBTQ fan groups last week, as well as Kick It Out, having also attended Chelsea Women’s 5-0 win over Reading on Sunday. “We’re not going to be able to persuade all the fans right away that we will be good stewards of Chelsea – we’re going to have to show them with meaningful action if we are successful in our bid,” she said.  “But I can assure all Chelsea fans that it has been my life’s work to fight against discrimination and bigotry of any kind. “Coming out as an LGBTQ+ woman has influenced my perspective and sensitivity about diversity and inclusion. I can’t know what it’s like to walk in another person’s shoes, but I can begin to understand and have an awareness of their different experience. “And that’s a gift. In the position that I’m in, I feel a sense of responsibility to be an advocate. To me, being an advocate means speaking up, and also listening.” She continued: “We have had a memorable few days in London, taking the opportunity to meet as many people as possible from a wide variety of backgrounds.  “Obviously, I can’t comment on talks we had with Chelsea officials because that has to remain confidential. “But I can say we had very informative and enjoyable meetings with some passionate fan groups – in particular with Tracy Brown from Chelsea Pride and Kerrie Evans from Chelsea Women Supporters’ Group. “We also met Sanjay Bhandari, the Chair of Kick It Out, and it was wonderful to hear about all the work he’s doing. We admire their approach and would like to introduce them to Major League Baseball. “Tracy Brown reminded me of a lot of people I know and have worked with in Chicago – leaders who put themselves out there for their community. “She loves Chelsea and wants herself and her community to be acknowledged and to have a voice. “We agreed to stay in touch, starting with a Zoom next week with me and the Founder of Out at Wrigley, an annual LGBTQ+ event that the Cubs have hosted at Wrigley Field since 2001.  “I was also thrilled to go to the Chelsea Women’s game at the weekend and I flew in early to make the match. It was a joy to see the incredible athletic talent of the Chelsea Women and to also experience the supporters’ amazing energy at Kingsmeadow. “Much of my life’s work has been about empowering and supporting women, so to see these young women playing at this level was a real treat for me. “It was also so great to see all the families who were at the game. Sport has such power to bring communities together and family is at the heart of the community. “Some of the girls there reminded me of my 11-year-old daughter. For young girls to see the Chelsea Women on the pitch can be inspiring and empowering to them. “In recent weeks, we’ve also had several valuable conversations with the Chelsea Supporters’ Trust. “I appreciate their passion for Chelsea and the important questions they’ve raised. I look forward to continuing the good conversations we’ve begun.  “We all need to be listening and speaking up, and I feel a particular responsibility because of the position I’m in. “When we assumed responsibility for the Chicago Cubs and its legacy, we immediately realised that teams like the Cubs don’t belong to one person or organisation. They belong to the fans. We’re stewards – and we’re answerable to the fans. That’s how we see it in Chicago – and it would be exactly the same at Chelsea. “There is such power in sport for community building and to bring diverse people together. At Cubs Charities, we have developed our own sport-based youth development programming that engages young people and families in under-served communities. As the chair of Cubs Charities, I am proud of our work and the impact it has on so many lives. “Here, the Chelsea Foundation already makes a significant impact and I would hope we could help build on this. “We strive to be champions both on and off the field. It’s what makes Chelsea great, and is a tradition we would honour if we were to become the club’s next stewards.” ",positive,liverpool,0

A first-half header from Renan Lodi proved to be all that separated the two sides at Old Trafford, and ensured the Spanish side progressed to the quarter-finals by winning the tie 2-1 on aggregate.  But the Red Devils certainly had plenty of opportunities to score with Atleti goalkeeper Jan Oblak in inspired form. Oblak knew little about things when he denied Anthony Elanga from close range early on, while the Slovenian excellently denied Bruno Fernandes from distance just before the break. Raphael Varane was also denied by Oblak, who clawed away the defender’s powerful header as Atletico held on to the win. The result sees Man United’s wait for a trophy extend to over five years – their last piece of silverware seeing them win the Europa League in May 2017. Rangnick has to rally his troops for an uphill battle as they look to qualify for next season’s Champions League by finishing in the top four after seeing Tuesday’s confident, determined start peter out. Cristiano Ronaldo was showing skills down the flank inside the opening minute and then Elanga somehow reached a cross before Oblak, only for referee Slavko Vincic to award a foul after the teenager headed off target.  Rangnick told his players to take a leaf out of the teenager’s book following his equaliser in Spain and the academy graduate again looked undaunted by the occasion on Tuesday. The 19-year-old went agonisingly close to scoring a 13th-minute opener as he met a driven Bruno Fernandes cross with a first-time shot that Oblak blocked with his head. It was an important stop, as was the one pulled off by opposite number David De Gea when he clawed away a slightly deflected 30-yard effort from Rodrigo De Paul that was bound for the top corner. United looked the greater threat at this point. Fred produced some outrageous skill to get past Stefan Savic at the byline, with Diogo Dalot having a couple of shots and Fernandes seeing penalty appeals ignored. But the hosts’ control began to loosen and they nearly fell behind in the 34th minute as Alex Telles was caught napping as Koke played wide to Marcos Llorente, who had strayed narrowly offside before crossing for Felix to score. Atleti exposed United’s full-backs again seven minutes later but this time it counted.   Calls for a foul on Elanga fell on deaf ears as Atleti launched a considered, slick attack that ended with Felix backheeling for Griezmann to cross to the back stick, where Lodi was free to head past De Gea at his near post. Fernandes stung Oblak’s palms from distance in first-half stoppage time and Elanga fizzed across the face of goal moments after the restart. De Gea let his fury known after being played into trouble by hesitant Harry Maguire and having to save a De Paul attempt, before Fred slashed wide and Jadon Sancho volleyed over against a side content to sit deep and break. A whipped Fernandes free-kick just evaded Ronaldo before the former was withdrawn as part of a triple change that saw Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic and Marcus Rashford introduced. Jose Maria Gimenez and Griezmann tried to score a second for Atletico, who were frustrating United as referee Vincic’s decisions infuriated. Edinson Cavani was brought on as United hunted a leveller that nearly arrived in the 77th minute when Raphael Varane rose to meet a Telles free-kick with a header that Oblak saved impressively.  Dalot went close from distance and there was sarcastic applause when Juan Mata came on for skipper Maguire in a final roll of the dice. Technical director Darren Fletcher was booked as Atleti ran down the clock and went through to the quarter-finals at Old Trafford, where Simeone ran down the touchline and the tunnel at full-time.    888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1

The Premier League club has confirmed their partnerships with USM, Megafon and Yota have been suspended with immediate effect. All three companies are associated with Alisher Usmanov, the Uzbekistan-born Russian billionaire who is a major backer of the club through his close working relationship with majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri. Everton’s statement read: “Everyone at Everton remains shocked and saddened by the appalling events unfolding in Ukraine. “This tragic situation must end as soon as possible, and any further loss of life must be avoided. “The players, coaching staff and everyone working at Everton is providing full support to our player Vitalii Mykolenko and his family and will continue to do so. “The club can confirm that it has suspended with immediate effect all commercial sponsorship arrangements with the Russian companies USM, Megafon and Yota.” Everton have been under increasing pressure to act due to Usmanov’s ties with Vladimir Putin, something that has led him to being sanctioned by the European Union.  Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the EU added ’26 persons’ to the list of those affected with sanctions including an asset freeze, a prohibition from making funds available to the listed individuals and entities, as well as a travel ban to prevent them passing through the EU territory. In an official statement from the European Union, Usmanov was described as a ‘pro-Kremlin oligarch with particularly close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin’. The statement added: “[Usmanov] has been referred to as one of Vladimir Putin’s favourite oligarchs. “He is considered to be one of Russia’s businessmen-officials, who were entrusted with servicing financial flows, but their positions depend on the will of the President.” In response, Usmanov described the sanctions as ‘unfair’, saying in a statement of his own:“On 28 February 2022 I became the target of restrictive measures imposed by the European Union.  “I believe that such decision is unfair, and the reasons employed to justify the sanctions are a set of false and defamatory allegations damaging my honour, dignity and business reputation. “I will use all legal means to protect my honour and reputation. “I hereby suspend the exercise of my duties as the President of the International Fencing Federation effective immediately until justice is restored.” Sensitivity around the situation is paramount at Goodison Park with Ukraine star Vitaliy Mykolenko part of Frank Lampard’s squad. Mykolenkolooked visibly emotionalon Saturday ahead of his side’s clash with Premier League leaders Manchester City at Goodison Park.  The 22-year-old was seen in deep in conversation with City’s Oleksandr Zinchenko before and during the match as both clubs showed their support for their home nation. Mykolenko has since spoken out against his Russian counterparts in a impassioned post on Instagram. Hitting out at Russia national team skipper Dzyuba, the Everton man wrote: “Whilst you remain a silent b**** along with your s***head football teammates, peaceful civilians are being killed in Ukraine. “You will be locked in a prison for the rest of your life and most importantly the lives of your kids.

With Ukraine under attack from Russia, gestures of support for the nation have appeared across the football and wider sporting world.  The likes of Crystal Palace and Manchester United have sent out messages, with Ukraine’s capital Kyiv under siege. Man City’s clash with Everton features a pair of Ukraine internationals who interrupted their pre-match warm ups to embrace. The Goodison crowd roared into applause at the gesture, and then showed even more support with Ukrainian flags, shirts and messages for the players, as well as playing the song, ‘He ain’t heavy, he’s my brother’. The pair of Ukrainian left-backs were on the substitutes benches for their respective sides, and very visibly moved by the pre-match scenes. Everton’s players entered the field draped in Ukrainian flags, while City’s squad wore shirts with the yellow and blue flag and the words ‘no war’. Opposing managers Frank Lampard and Pep Guardiola have since commented on the current mental state of their players, with the latter empathising with Zinchenko.   When asked how the City defender was feeling, Guardiola said: “Worried. “Yesterday I said in the press conference well you should be if you are in your country where you grew up, it’s your mother tongue, you language, your friends, your families under attack for the decision of one person or two people, like they’re at home and send the people to kill themselves, so we will be worried, like Alex is.” Lampard also commented on Mykolenko, who had signs of support from fans throughout the stands. “It’s important to show the support,” Lampard said. “I think we have a lot of support at the club, it’s a people’s club but I think generally some of the support you’ve seen in the sporting world it’s been fantastic.  “I’ve had numerous conversations with him and the decision was always his to be involved or not he’s never given me the inkling he doesn’t want to be involved because I think it’s a small release for him at the minute to train with us and feel like he’s part of our family. “The onus is on us to support him to do what we can, there’s not much help we can give other than to know that we’re there for him, so tough time for him and I’m sure both sets of fans will show support for both players.” ",positive,liverpool,0

The Frenchman got one over on the club he played 279 times for, thanks to goals from Jean-Philippe Mateta, Jordan Ayew, and Wilfried Zaha.  Joachim Andersen, who has impressed since his move from Lyon in the summer, was heavily involved and had a hand in both first-half goals for Palace. Getting on the end of a delightful Conor Gallagher free-kick, the defender inadvertently headed the ball across to Mateta, who comfortably tucked the ball home from close range. But the Dane knew a lot more about his second assist, as he slid a fantastic ball through to Ayew, who tucked it past Aaron Ramsdale in the Gunners’ goal. Arsenal struggled to create anything in the first half and brought Gabriel Martinelli on at half-time as they looked for a breakthrough. But it was the Eagles that were to find the back of the net in the second period, as Wilfried Zaha won and scored a penalty, which was given away by Martin Odegaard. Arsenal did push for a consolation as the game ticked on, with Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe having efforts superbly saved and blocked, whilst substitute Eddie Nketiah hit the crossbar.  Vieira’s Palace giving us a lesson in aggression, desire & physicality.

O’Hara has compared the situation to last season’s Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, when Max Verstappen was controversially given the opportunity to overtake Lewis Hamilton and seize the title on the final lap of the race. “It’s like a Formula 1 moment,” O’Hara told the Sports Bar on talkSPORT. “You think about last season, the Hamilton and Verstappen moment, when they manipulated the race to make it brilliant for the public to watch.  “But actually, it was unfair on Hamilton. Is that what we’re going to start seeing [in football] now? “Manipulating the fixtures because they go, ‘That will be brilliant for the viewing public, we’ll get increased viewing figures, who cares what the clubs think!’ “As a Spurs fan, I’m actually quite happy about it, because it gives us a chance to pile some pressure on Arsenal, go into the last week of the season, and have a huge fixture. “It’ll probably be midweek, under the lights, at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. But I understand the Premier League are manipulating this fixture for the drama – is that right?” However, co-host Jason Cundy insists neither club can complain about the timing of the rescheduled fixture and defended organisers for prioritising entertainment value. Cundy told talkSPORT: “If you’re the Premier League, you want to maximise a game like this.  “Potentially, you’re looking at one of the biggest games of the season and one of the biggest north London derbies we’ve seen in years. “Why wouldn’t you maximise viewing audiences, the interest in the game? “Neither team have Europe [to deal with], they’ve had loads of time off, there can be no complaints. “I understand completely why they’ve done it and I would’ve done the same.” 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1

It was another dramatic night of European football last night, with three British sides in action and West Ham left fuming by a harsh referee decision. The Hammers drew 1-1 in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final tie with Lyon after Aaron Cresswell was sent off. The decision was blasted by fans and pundits, with German referee Felix Zwayer blasted as a ‘clown’. Meanwhile, Rangers will have to come from behind at the Ibrox after losing the first leg of their last-eight tie 1-0 to Braga, and Leicester’s Europa Conference League clash with PSV is finely poised after a 0-0 draw. Elsewhere, Frank Lampard has reportedly been backed by Everton chiefs despite the Merseyside club’s terrible form, and Manchester United have been linked with breaking their transfer record as they reportedly plan a summer squad overhaul. And there’s more football tonight, with Newcastle vs Wolves kicking off an action-packed weekend in the Premier League, as we look ahead to the big one on Sunday – Man City vs Liverpool.

The Blues centre-back was guilty of a poor ‘half-challenge’ on French star Benzema, which allowed him to score his hat-trick goal in the 3-1 win at Stamford Bridge. In the quarter-final of the Champions League, trophy holders Chelsea locked horns with the Spanish giants looking to make the most of having the first-leg at home. But the game did not go to plan, as Benzema once again showcased his importance to the 13-time winners despite his age. The 34-year-old, who Real boss Carlo Ancelotti is ‘ageing like a fine wine’, netted a hat-trick which included two outstanding headers in the space of three first-half minutes. There was an element of fortunate for his goal that secured the match ball, as Blues goalkeeper Edouard Mendy and Rudiger had a calamitous moment. After the ball fell to him following a clearance from a Real player, 30-year-old goalkeeper Mendy had time and options to clear the ball. But his pass to the German defender was far too light, and it gave Benzema the chance to steal the ball.  Whilst it was a poor pass from the AFCON winning shot-stopper, Rudiger  had the chance of bailing his goalkeeper out. But his tackle was not strong enough to dispossess Benzema, who then had the simple task of placing the ball into an empty net. Speaking on Thursday’s talkSPORT Breakfast, Gabby Agbonlahor gave his thoughts and believed Rudiger was thinking about a potential transfer this summer and pulled out of a tough tackle to avoid any kind of injury. “I know it was a bad pass on Mendy, but Rudiger’s tackle was someone who didn’t want to get injured,” said the former Aston Villa captain. “It was like he’s got a move ready and he didn’t want to hurt himself.”  Former Chelsea defender Mario Melchiot didn’t completely agree with that statement, but did agree that Rudiger could have done more to stop the rampant Frenchman. “I can’t really say that, because he’s normally so tough, he does not care about that,” Melchiot told talkSPORT. “But the way he went in it, I agree with you, he could have gone tougher. “And he went with his left foot instead of his right and normally if you make the tackle with your right, and you go all the way [you would win the ball].  “Everything was half, half ball, half challenge, and that’s why Benzema [scored].” Rudiger is out of contract at Chelsea this summer and has been widely linked with an exit from Stamford Bridge at the end of the season. The Germany international is reportedly wanted by a host of suitors, with Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain the main contenders, although it has been claimed Manchester United could look to keep him in the Premier League by offering Rudiger a move to Old Trafford. 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1

The striker, who also scored three goals against Paris Saint-Germain in Madrid’s last European fixture, became just the fourth player to score 80 or more Champions League goals, joining Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and Robert Lewandowski in the elite list.  Benzema’s first two came with his head, with the first angled into the top right corner – which Tony Cascarino told talkSPORT was ‘as good as you’re ever going to see’ – and the second caressed into the bottom left of the Chelsea net. Kai Havertz, who has scored plenty of important goals for Chelsea in this competition, also netted with his head after latching onto a clever ball by Jorginho, which just left the German to nod past ex-Blue Thibaut Courtois. But Madrid restored their two-goal lead after a mistake by Edouard Mendy. The Chelsea man came out of his goal and, when trying to play a simple pass to teammate Antonio Rudiger, gave the ball straight to Benzema – which was reminiscent of when Gianluigi Donnarumma did a similar thing when Madrid beat Paris Saint-Germain in the last-16. “Donnarumma. That’s all I can think of,” Cascarino told talkSPORT. “He did exactly the same thing. “I had a rant the other week on Sports Breakfast about goalkeepers trying to be clever with intricate passes and Mendy has had an absolute stinker, he really has. ⚽️⚽️⚽️ Back-to-back hat-tricks in the Champions League:2021/22: Karim Benzema 2016/17: Cristiano Ronaldo 2016/17: Lionel Messi2014/15: Luiz Adriano#UCL pic.twitter.com/rXjPyJX26E   “He’s tried to be clever– just get it out of the danger area. Chelsea now have a mountain to climb.” It was also the first time a player has scored three times against the Blues in the Champions League, while Benzema is one of only four players to score successive trebles in the competition. Luiz Adriano is one, with Messi and Ronaldo the others. However, only Ronaldo and Benzema have done it in the knockout stages. The France striker, meanwhile, has now broken the record for the most Champions League goals scored in a single season by a Frenchman. David Trezeguet, Wissam Ben Yedder and international team-mate Kylian Mbappe had all scored eight goals in a single campaign, but this was Benzema’s ninth for Real Madrid this season. After that third Madrid goal, Chelsea had chances to reduce the deficit ahead of a trip to the Bernabeu on April 12 but didn’t take them. Cesar Azpilicueta had a long-range strike brilliantly saved by Courtois, whilst substitute Romelu Lukaku couldn’t get his close-range header on target. It means that Thomas Tuchel‘s side will have to travel to Spain and beat the La Liga leaders by at least two goals if they are to keep hold of their Champions League crown. 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1

The striker continued his goal scoring season, with one for his club in the 3-1 Champions League defeat to Liverpool. At just 22 years old, he has scored 28 goals in 35 games across European competitions this season. Of the top scoring players under 23, he leads the way in front of goal, with Dusan Vlahovic on 25 and Erling Haaland on 23. Clearly, age is just a number and Nunez is showcasing why so many teams are keen on his services. Considering Arsenal were so keen on Vlahovic in January, some fans may see Juventus nipping in to nab him from Fiorentina as a blessing if they win the race to sign his service. Speaking on talkSPORT, European football journalist Andy Brassell gave an insight as to what kind of player he is, and where his future could lie. “Darwin Nunez has already been pretty closely inclined to the Premier League a couple of times,” he said. “The first time, before he joined Benfica was when he was leaving Almeria.  “And Benfica decided they wanted him so badly that they paid a lot more than they intended to pay in the first place, over €20million. “But he’s proved absolutely worth it, I think when they bought him they did have in mind they would sell him to a Premier League club at some point, and he’s got all the attributes that make you think he would end up in England at some point. “He’s strong, he’s physical, can hold the ball up, he’s a great finisher of course, but he can also run the channels as well.   “He’s just a bull of a centre-forward, he occupies defenders and not just one defender, but central defenders so well. “In terms of goal scoring, in a team that’s struggled a little bit this season, they were big favourites to win the league Benfica at the start of the season, and at the start of last season, when they spent a lot of money on bringing a lot players in, including big contracts like to Jan Vertongen. “And they’ve fallen well short, they’re in third place this season, nine points second placed Sporting [Lisbon], so they’re almost certainly going into the Champions League play-offs again come the end of the summer, this year.” “But despite everything that’s been going on around him, change of coach, he’s been keeping his head down and been brilliant.   “He is so physical, he puts so much into the game that there will be miles on the clock at some point. “That hasn’t put Premier League clubs off as far as I’m aware. “West Ham were very interested in signing him, but wouldn’t go up to the €60m that Benfica wanted in winter. “I wouldn’t be surprised if he ends up there at some point.” Tottenham will look for more firepower if Harry Kane leaves, while the Gunners are likely to want a new striker in the summer, too and money is no object for Newcastle who will not bat an eyelid at a possible €60m price tag.

Diego Simeone’s stubborn and cynical Liga side were eventually broken down in the 70th minute of the Champions League quarter-final as Kevin De Bruyne gave the hosts a well-deserved lead ahead of the second leg.  Atletico showed little appetite for the ball and relied on a handful of counter-attacks to pose a threat, delivering a typically-disciplined defensive display. But after conceding, the LaLiga champions resorted to their infamous dark arts, chopping down City’s players and demanding punishment for every small infringement. Jack Grealish felt the full force of Atletico’s treatment and Pep Guardiola was forced to intervene when Angel Correa smashed the ball in the Englishman’s face as he lay on the ground. Meanwhile, Simeone went charging down to the assistant referee after Matheus Cunha rolled around on the turf in stoppage time, before the Argentine boss snubbed a handshake with Guardiola at full-time. Those were just a few examples – and talkSPORT host Adrian Durham could not hide his feelings towards the Spanish side after the game. He said: “I’m going to call it as I see it: this Atletico Madrid side are an absolute disgrace.   “I’ll call them horrible, cheaty, anti-football, no desire to entertain. Simeone is a ref pest. “The players are sneaky, out-housing, Sunday League wrong ‘uns. “Atletico Madrid have no desire to play football whatsoever. If I were Joao Felix, I would ask for a transfer so I could continue being a professional footballer. “Why anybody would want Simeone as their manager, I do not know.” Meanwhile, Wales legend Dean Saunders accused Atletico of ‘parasite football’ for sucking the life out of games. He told talkSPORT: “If you want to spoil a game of football, just play like Atletico Madrid.  “They’re actually trying to spoil the game. They sit back and wait. It’s called parasite football – they live off your mistakes. “They shut the doors all over the pitch and just try to intercept a pass. “If you sit back against Man City and invite them to pass it round you, eventually they will score a goal. Then you can’t get one back. “It’s terrible to watch, terrible to play in, nobody’s going to enjoy it. “If you watch Man City vs Liverpool, it’s going to be entertaining. I’ve played like that myself, as long as you get a result – I’m not having a go at Simeone. “But the way he’s setting up, it’s spoiling the game to watch, spoiling it to play in, condensing the space, showing no ambition to score.  “When you’re watching the game, you fall asleep.” However, co-host Jason Cundy sprung to the defence of Atletico, insisting there should be no problem with their style of play. Cundy told talkSPORT: “They are kings of the s-housery. They play in a very different way and they win football matches. “If you go toe-to-toe with Man City, you’re going to get thumped. I don’t know whether you can criticise what they did tonight. “You’ve got to come up with a formula to beat Atletico and that’s the challenge for Guardiola. “I don’t have a problem with the way they play.

And Manchester United are desperate for the Portuguese superstar to break his goal scoring duck at Goodison Park to help fire them into the top four. Illness meant Ronaldo missed the Red Devils last outing, a 1-1 draw with Leicester, that left them three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham. But now Rangnick has confirmed the 37-year-old is back, and admitted that Saturday’s clash with relegation-threatened Everton is a must win. He said: “That happens in football [big teams struggling], not only England but in other leagues. But for us again, it’s about being aware about the current situation. “We still have a chance to qualify for the Champions League, but in order to do that we need to win and we definitely need to win the game tomorrow. “If you look at the current situation in the table, we can’t afford to drop points anymore and I think everybody in the team and the squad is aware of that.” Ronaldo is United’s top scorer in the league this season with 12 goals, and the club are yet to win a Premier League match where he has not started. The omens are also good for the Red Devils as Ronaldo has only ever lost one of his 13 games against Everton across his two spells in England.  That defeat did come at Goodison Park however, as nine-man United were beaten 1-0 in 2005 after Gary Neville and Paul Scholes saw red. And curiously for the five-time Ballon d’Or winner, he is yet to score a Premier League goal at Saturday’s venue Goodison in five meetings. All four of Ronaldo’s four top-flight goals against Everton have come at Old Trafford, although he didn’t net in the 1-1 reverse fixture in October. His solitary strike in the blue half of Merseyside came in an 2-0 FA Cup fifth round win in the 2004/05 season in which United ultimately lost in the final against Arsenal. But for United, there will be no runners-up medal this time if Ronaldo and co come up second best away at the Toffees…  888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,1

Kane looked set to join Manchester City last summer, however, Spurs managed to keep hold of their star man. The striker initially told Spurs he wanted to leave but City’s attempts to sign him ended in failure and the England skipper has scored 33 goals for club and country this term. Gerrard had opportunities to leave Liverpool, most notably for Chelsea in 2005 after winning the Champions League, but stayed at Anfield until 2015. The 41-year-old only went on to win the FA Cup and League Cup with Liverpool before joining LA Galaxy and feels any silverware at Spurs would mean more to Kane. “I admire his loyalty to Tottenham and, of course, I’m sure it’s been tempting for him on many occasions to go and take one of those options,” he said, ahead of Spurs’ trip to Villa Park on Saturday, which is live on talkSPORT. “The Spurs fans should enjoy him and admire the loyalty he’s given them. You can see a guy who is desperate for success with Tottenham and I have a lot of admiration for that. “He might still have the opportunity to achieve a couple of things in his career which might mean more to him with Tottenham than anyone else because of what Tottenham have also given the player.  “That’s what it boiled down to with me. The decision was, yes I could go to three or four teams in a foreign country or a couple domestically who maybe have a better chance of winning. “But winning something with your team, the one you love and the supporters you love, I think that will mean more to him for the rest of his life than a short-term fix.” Gerrard also revealed his regret at not playing with Kane for England after retiring from international football a year before the striker made his senior debut. “I wish I had the opportunity to play with him, you always want to play with top players,” he said.  “The way he plays would have helped my game to the next level and I’ve got enough confidence and belief in the way I played I might have been able to help him. I played with world class players with England and unfortunately I never got the chance to play with him. “He’s the perfect captain for England right now, a world class player and with the way he carries himself on and off the pitch.” Gerrard could welcome back Marvelous Nakamba from a knee injury while Emi Buendia and Tyrone Mings are expected to shake off knocks following last week’s 2-1 defeat at Wolves which left Villa 11th in the Premier League. Gerrard added: “It gives us an opportunity to try and come out of the blocks quicker and try to find a performance over 90 minutes – that’s what we need if we’re to find the outcome we want.” Listen to full commentary of Aston Villa vs Tottenham live on talkSPORT, kick-off 5:30pm 888Sport: Get Man City to win at 10/1 or Liverpool at 20/1 (£5 max bet) – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply ",positive,liverpool,3

At the end of the year, three teams will be relegated from the Premier League and the fight to survive is well and truly on. Assuming Brighton are just about safe ten points clear of the drop zone, there are seven sides locked in a relegation battle, with some massive games coming up. Most teams have eight games remaining this season but due to Covid and other issues, several sides have more or less matches to play, which could cause heartbreak for some. Here, talkSPORT looks at how the Premier League relegation picture is shaping up as we enter the final weeks of the campaign.   Brentford have not been in the relegation zone all season, which is impressive and shows the Bees have been comfortable in the top-flight. Thomas Frank’s side started the season with a 2-0 win over Arsenal, and by the end of October, they were ninth. An awful run of seven defeats in eight looked to have put Brentford in trouble, but the Bees then beat Norwich and Burnley in back-to-back games before thrashing Chelsea 4-1 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. They were huge results and the west Londoners are 11 points clear of the drop zone with seven games left to play. Brentford must still play Tottenham, Manchester United and West Ham while face three relegation rivals in Watford, Everton and Leeds. You would think that they have done enough to secure top-flight football no matter what happens. Predicted finish – 16th West Ham – H – 10 April Watford – A – 16 April Tottenham – H – 23 April Manchester United – A – 2 May Southampton – H – 7 May Everton – A – 15 May Leeds – H – 22 May  Newcastle looked doomed after 19 games – they were 19th and had only won once. But the combination of five new players and Eddie Howe’s work on the training field sparked a superb run that saw the Toon go unbeaten for nearly two months. During that run, they lost Kieran Trippier and Allan Saint-Maximin to injury but kept grinding out results, and after a 2-1 win over Southampton, Newcastle were on 31 points. But they lost their last two before the international break and were hammered 5-1 by Tottenham on Sunday. They are still probably safe but need a couple more wins from their remaining eight games to make sure The Toon do still have Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City to play but they have easier home games against Wolves, Leicester and Crystal Palace. However, if they don’t pick up points from those games, the Toon travel to Carrow Road and Turf Moor. They are the ties the Magpies must take points from. Predicted finish – 14th Wolves – H – 8 April Leicester – H – 17 April Crystal Palace – H – 20 April Norwich – A – 23 April Liverpool – H – 30 April Manchester City – A – 7 May Arsenal – H – 15 May Burnley – A – 22 May  Leeds have conceded the most goals in the Premier League (68), even more than Norwich, and because of that, relegation is still a real threat. This year has been a struggle for Leeds and they have been in a relegation dog-fight all season. Injuries to key players have exposed their squad and, after heavy defeats to the likes of Liverpool, Everton and Tottenham, Marcelo Bielsa was sacked and replaced by Jesse Marsch. The American made a poor start but the Whites are unbeaten in three and are eight points clear of the drop zone with seven games to go. Leeds still have to play Chelsea, Man City and Arsenal, while they face Watford soon and travel to Brentford on the last day of the season. The Whites also take on Brighton, with the Seagulls in poor form at the moment. Ultimately, those last two wins for Leeds over Norwich and Wolves should be enough to keep them up. Predicted Finish – 15th Watford – A – 9 April Chelsea – H – 17 April Crystal Palace – A – 23 April Manchester City – H – 30 April Arsenal – A – 7 May Brighton – H – 15 May Brentford – A – 22 May  Everton have never been relegated from the Premier League but there is a danger of that happening this season. Poor decisions have hit the Toffees hard and they are now relying on Frank Lampard to save them. Everton replaced Carlo Ancelotti with former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez, and despite a good start, it was never going to end well, and the Spaniard was dismissed in January. Lampard has arrived in his place and has won two league games, but back-to-back defeats against West Ham and Burnley have plunged the Toffees into even greater trouble. They still have to face Man United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal while facing relegation clashes against Watford and Brentford. Oddly, they must still play Leicester twice. So, while they have games in hand, many of their remaining fixtures look really tough. Predicted finish – 18th Mannchester United – H – 9 April Crystal Palace – H – 16 April Leicester – H – 20 April Liverpool – A – 24 April Chelsea – H – 1 May Leicester – A – 7 May Brentford – H – 15 May Arsenal – A – 22 May Watford – A – TBA  Watford are onto their third manager of the season and they hope Roy Hodgson can keep them in the Premier League. The Hornets started well with Emmanuel Dennis impressing, but things turned sour, and Xisco Munoz was sacked and replaced by Claudio Ranieri. The Italian managed just one league win against Man United and was dismissed after a 3-0 defeat to Norwich. Hodgson has sorted out the defence and Watford have managed two wins since he arrived, but they are still in trouble and are three points adrift of Everton. The Hornets still have eight games to play and face Man City and Chelsea. But the big matches are Everton, Leeds, Brentford and Burnley. They will be the ties that decide Watford’s fate. Hodgson knows how to keep teams up and he might just do it again this year. Predicted finish – 17th Leeds – H – 9 April Brentford – H – 16 April Manchester City – A – 23 April Burnley – H – 30 April Crystal Palace – A – 7 May Leicester – H – 15 May Chelsea – A – 22 May Everton – H – TBA  Burnley have been in the Premier League for six seasons but it seems a year too far for Sean Dyche’s men. The Clarets have won only three games and have scored just 22 goals, which explains why they are in trouble. They have conceded 40 goals, which is better than most teams in the bottom half, but they will have to more than double their current win tally to stay up. The Clarets have lost their last four of their last league games without scoring a goal and still have to play the likes of Tottenham and West Ham. But they beat Everton and face Norwich, Watford and Newcastle in their final nine games, so they need to win all of those to have any chance of staying up. Predicted finish – 19th Norwich – A – 10 April West Ham – A – 17 April Southampton – H – 21 April Wolves – H – 24 April Watford – A – 30 April Aston Villa – H – 7 May Tottenham – A – 15 May Newcastle – H – 22 May Aston Villa – A – TBA  Norwich have been in the relegation zone the whole season, and with so little time remaining, it is hard to see how they could survive. The Canaries have managed four wins but have lost 20 of their 30 games and have conceded 63 goals. They have lost six of their last seven and are seven point adrift of safety. It seems almost certain that they will go down and they will need five or even six victories if they are to stay up. Smith’s side still have Man United, West Ham and Tottenham to face, while they also play Burnley and Newcastle and several mid-table sides. However, you can’t see them getting five wins and Norwich look doomed.
