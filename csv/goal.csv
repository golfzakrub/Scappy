And as heads hit pillows on Sunday evening, Manchester City will still hold the slenderest of leads at the top of the Premier League table. But the defending champions might yet come to rue the chance they missed to kill the title race once and for all. They remain a point clear of Liverpool at the summit of English football and it is not inconceivable that they will hold that advantage until the last day of the season. But when Riyad Mahrez broke through deep in injury time, with only Alisson to beat, he had the chance to put a huge puncture in Liverpool's title hopes. After twice coming back, there would have been no time and no third opportunity for Jurgen Klopp's side, but City's top scorer could only loop his effort over the bar, leaving one of the most thrilling title races in years to live on. ""It's a great chance,"" admitted Kevin De Bruyne to Sky Sports at full-time. ""Riyad chose to chip and if it goes in it's a wonder goal. ""It was hard. To be fair I think we played excellent. The way we played was very good and we should score more. It is what it is. It was a great game. ""I think it should [be more before half-time] but we were still winning. The way the second half started is the disappointment. I think we played great and created enough chances to win the game."" What a way to stay exactly where they were at kick-off - a 90 minutes of breathless, brilliant football that is already an instant classic. A match between the best two teams in England - for many the best in the world - and they delivered like they always do. A clash where the tensions will have been felt around the planet, let alone in the electric atmosphere of the Etihad Stadium. In the stands, they lived every second of it, just as they did in the dugouts. One minute, Pep Guardiola was stood two yards on the pitch trying to get his message across to his players. The next he was discarding his jacket in frustration at letting Liverpool snatch an equaliser. Jurgen Klopp was not much calmer to his right, punching the air with every tackle, turning in despair at every missed opportunity. But the two managers have only themselves to blame. Only Guardiola and Klopp could go into a game with everything on the line and give everything for a victory. Who else but Guardiola would leave Aymeric Laporte and Kyle Walker isolated against the twin threat of Mohammed Salah and Sadio Mane in the opening minutes? And who would trust a goalkeeper as ridiculously calm as Ederson to let the ball drift onto his own goal-line under pressure from Diogo Jota before playing a simple three-yard pass? And, in turn, who would allow Thiago to play short square passes in his own six-yard box with five City attackers within striking distance? And who would chase a win in the final minutes at the Etihad knowing a defeat could almost destroy their chances of winning the title? From the opening minutes it was pulsating. Gabriel Jesus, Guardiola's wildcard choice for this big game, setting up Raheem Sterling, but his shot was blocked by a sprawling Alisson. But just seconds later, City were ahead. De Bruyne, always a player for the big occasion, was alert to Bernardo Silva's quickly-taken free kick before firing in a low shot that deflected off Joel Matip on its way past Alisson. Forget about City taking their usual control, though. These two sides are too good to exceed that for too long. Jota had levelled inside 13 minutes, before Jesus put the home side back ahead in the 36th minute with City creating the better chances. It was more of the same in the second half, with Mane equalising inside a minute before both sides went toe-to-toe and punch-buy-punch until the very final seconds. Guardiola and Klopp embraced enthusiastically at full-time, and the football world finally could draw breath. A game that was so good that it would probably be worth doing all over again next week. As luck would have it, these two meet at Wembley in an FA Cup semi-final on Saturday. Another classic awaits! Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Citizens seized the lead twice, through Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus, with Diogo Jota and Sadio Mane netting the response for the Reds. Raheem Sterling looked to have put the hosts back on top after the hour mark, only for his finish to be ruled out through VAR, but with the shares spoiled, it is Pep Guardiola's side who keep their noses in front of Jurgen Klopp's team at the summit. ""It was like a boxing fight, an epic bout,"" Klopp told NBC. ""If you put out your arms for a second, then you get a message knock, and that's what happened to both teams. ""I really think we're a step further than we were a year or so ago in possession. That's what we have to do in these games.

Footage of Ronaldo knocking the device to the floor began to circulate after Everton's 1-0 victory over the Red Devils at Goodison Park. Ronaldo later acknowledged what had happened and issued an apology to the affected supporter. ""At full-time the Man Utd players started walking off. We were in the Park End so we were right by the tunnel where they came walking past - my son was there videoing them all,"" Sarah Kelly, the mother of 14-year-old Jake Harding, told the Liverpool Echo. ""He filmed all the United players walking through. And then he lowered his phone because Ronaldo had pulled down his sock and his leg was bleeding.

The Catalan outfit fought back from behind to seize the lead through the latter, lost it again to a third penalty for their hosts and then snatched the win in injury time through Luuk de Jong's effort. It marked another impressive turn for Dembele however, who as recently as January looked set to become a Camp Nou outcast - and now Aubameyang, who bagged Barcelona's first goal, says that he should renew past this year rather than move onto new pastures. ""Ousmane knows me well,"" the Gabon star told Movistar+. ""I have to always be prepared when he goes to the right. ""It's normal for people to be aware of me. I can do much more.

Roma beat Salernitana 2-1 on Sunday, leaving the visitors rooted to the bottom of Serie A. Salernitana have taken just 16 points from their 30 matches in the league and are nine from safety with just eight games left to play. Mourinho admitted after the match that a member of his staff told a member of the opposition that they would soon be relegated, with the coach taking the opportunity to have a dig at Bodo/Glimt, who his club feuded with in the Europa Conference League. ‚ÄúI tell the truth, not like some clubs or the police. Someone on my bench told the Salernitana staff they were going to Serie B. I went to apologise for the lad who said that,"" Mourinho said at a press conference. ‚ÄúWe are civilised people, what happens on the field ends there. Nobody will be waiting outside 45 minutes later to punch someone in the face."" A fracas on the touchline during the Serie A encounter ended with Salernitana coach Davide Nicola trying to get to Roma assistant Salvatore Foti. It's only the latest controversy Roma have been involved in this week. After their 2-1 win in their Europa Conference League match against Bodo/Glimt, captain Lorenzo Pellegrini said that the Norwegian team's coach, Kjetil Knutsen, attacked Roma's goalkeeping coach Nuno Gomes. He said after the match: ‚ÄúSomething truly unpleasant just happened. The changing rooms are opposite and Knutsen began to say something to our coach and then attacked.

Maguire has struggled to live up to his ¬£80 million ($104m) price tag since joining United from Leicester City in 2019. The 29-year-old was handed captaincy duties midway through his first season at Old Trafford, but his leadership credentials have often been called into question, particularly this season as the Red Devils have fallen to seventh in the Premier League standings. Ralf Rangnick's side are in danger of missing out on Champions League qualification and have been knocked out of every major cup competition. Their chances of securing a top-four Premier League finish were severly dented by a 1-0 loss at Everton on Saturday as Anthony Gordon scored the winner with the aid of a deflection off Maguire. Vidic, who won five league titles and the Champions League in a hugely impressive eight year spell at Old Trafford as a player, feels Maguire should now be taken out of the firing line. ‚ÄúEvery player has a problem with form at some time in his career,‚Äù he told The Athletic when quizzed on the centre-back's recent struggles. ‚ÄúI did and it‚Äôs clear that Maguire is not at his best this season. I think you can do a few things and one of them is not to play every match as you try to find form again and get confidence. ""A coach could play him in easier games, not that there are many in the Premier League, and take him out for harder matches. The player needs to feel powerful and strong on the pitch again, not as it is now where he feels that it‚Äôs not happening for him. ""It‚Äôs difficult to play well when you‚Äôre under so much pressure because people are waiting for you to make a mistake."" The Red Devils have conceded 42 goals in the Premier League so far this term, more than any other side in the top nine, and now sit six points behind Tottenham in the race for fourth. Maguire has been at the heart of a defence that has only managed to record seven clean sheets, and Vidic has advised him to ask for a break to clear his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a problem if a player says to his coach that he‚Äôs not feeling great on the pitch,"" he added. ""If he says: ‚ÄòGive me a break, give me a couple of weeks to regroup and train well and then play again‚Äô. ""I had some horrible games for United and needed to find my peace and grow again.‚Äù Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

7,https://www.goal.com/en/news/real-madrid-man-city-target-enzo-fernandez-alvarez-river/blt332cb6eaf2427e67,Real Madrid & Man City target Enzo Fernandez looks to follow in Alvarez's River Plate footsteps,"For much of the past year, Julian Alvarez has by and large been the only player talked about at River Plate and justifiably so. The striker exploded onto the scene to lead his side to the 2021 Liga Profesional title, and earned himself a multi-million pound move to Manchester City in the process. But Alvarez is not the only gem driving on the Millonario right now. If anything, 21-year-old midfield sensation Enzo Fernandez has been even more impressive than the City-bound star since the start of the 2022 season. And if he keeps it up, a similarly lucrative transfer will surely not be long in coming. Fernandez, who was born in the northern Buenos Aires suburb of San Martin, has spent almost the entirety of his short life in River's ranks. He was just four years old when he first signed for the club and, save for a year-long loan at Defensa y Justicia, has progressed from their infant divisions to the first team in an uninterrupted climb up the ladder. That loan spell proved a turning point for the youngster. Falling under the tutelage of River legend Hernan Crespo, the teenager became a fixture in Defensa's midfield and played a big part in the club's Copa Sudamericana triumph in 2020, earning a place in the tournament's Ideal XI thanks to his tireless yet elegant play. ‚ÄúWhen Marcelo [Gallardo, River coach] told me about Defensa, I took it well because it was a chance to show myself, get some games, compete against first-rate players,‚Äù Fernandez explained to Ole. ‚ÄúI was lucky to be coached by two great trainers like Crespo and Sebastian Beccacece, share a squad with huge players and even better people and pick up two titles which will go down in history. ‚ÄúI have always been the same player, but my time at Defensa helped me grow so much, not just as a player but as a person. ‚ÄúI grew up lots and that prepared me to go back to River and adapt in a different way to the team's rhythm.‚Äù üé• Quintero, Sim√≥n y Enzo Fern√°ndez para abrir el camino de la victoria en Varela ‚ö°Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/I4Fa686zJN Upon his return to River in June last year, and having picked up another continental title along the way after Defensa shocked Libertadores champions Palmeiras in the Recopa Sudamericana, he was ready to star under Marcelo Gallardo. Fernandez has barely been out of River's starting XI since coming back and by the end of 2021 had another trophy to add to his growing collection as the Millo stormed to their first league win in seven years. Now he is at the heart of the team, sharing a double pivot with veteran Enzo Perez which is the foundation on which one of South America's most potent attacks is built. Perez, a member of Argentina's World Cup squads in both 2014 and 2018, sits in front of the defence, scurrying and cleaning up; Fernandez does almost everything else.Fernandez is a box-to-box operator in the purest sense. In Sunday's 2-1 victory over Defensa he opened the scoring against his old club and also struck the crossbar with a beautiful looping long-range effort. He also led River in almost every other metric to show off the complete nature of his game: seven out of 10 duels won; 46 passes completed in the opposition half; three out of four successful dribbles and no fewer than five shots, outgunning even Alvarez. Such has been his impact that Real Madrid are reportedly keeping close tabs on Fernandez's progress, a development that is music to his ears. ‚ÄúI am pleased because it means I am doing things right but my head is in River,‚Äù he told reporters when asked about the links. Defensa president Diego Lemme, meanwhile, is not surprised to hear the rumours, telling Como te va: ‚ÄúWhen we brought him to Defensa we told him he was a player for Real Madrid. I hope he can make it to Europe, he has more than enough talent.‚Äù The Spanish giants are not Fernandez's only reported suitors. In recent weeks Italian duo Inter and AC Milan and Madrid's Liga rivals Sevilla have also been linked to the budding star; as have City, presenting the intriguing prospect of seeing his partnership with Alvarez continue in the Premier League. For now Fernandez's priorities are clear. To continue starring for River at home and in the Libertadores, where they made a strong start to the 2022 campaign on Wednesday beating Alianza Lima 1-0 on the road. He will also aim to remain in the gaze of Argentina boss Lionel Scaloni, who included him in November's World Cup qualifying squad but declined to hand him his debut. The final tournament may come just a little too soon for the midfielder but if he carries on impressing with his all-action performances Scaloni may well consider taking him to Qatar as a ready-made understudy for Rodrigo de Paul, who is a player cut from a similar mould and also blessed with that irrepressible energy that makes such a difference in the engine room. What is absolutely certain is that we will be hearing much more from Fernandez in the months to come, and it would be no surprise if he follows Alvarez to one of Europe's elite outfits sooner rather than later.

8,https://www.goal.com/en/news/one-goal-seven-games-salah-slump-cause-concern-klopp/bltc7be402e33b7a6ce,"One goal in seven games: Why Salah's slump is concerning for Klopp, Liverpool and Man City","It‚Äôs hard to say who will be most concerned by Mohamed Salah‚Äôs recent dip in form. Liverpool, who head into the biggest game of their season with a star man who has managed only one goal ‚Äì a penalty ‚Äì in his last seven matches? Manchester City, who must surely fear a backlash from a player who has made them suffer plenty of times in the past? Or perhaps Salah himself, who has chosen perhaps the worst possible time to show that he is, in fact, human after all? When your standards are as high as the Egyptian‚Äôs are, anything that falls short can feel like a big thing. A run of 660 minutes without a goal from open play, then, qualifies almost as a full-blown crisis. Jurgen Klopp says he has no worries, but Salah‚Äôs frustration has been there for all to see in recent weeks. It was certainly there on Tuesday night, when he was substituted after just 61 minutes of Liverpool‚Äôs Champions League win over Benfica. Klopp‚Äôs decision may have been made with one eye on Sunday‚Äôs Premier League blockbuster at the Etihad (he insisted afterwards that it hadn‚Äôt) but Salah‚Äôs performance in Lisbon made it an easier call than usual in any case. An eyebrow or two was raised in Klopp‚Äôs post-match press conference when he suggested that Salah‚Äôs form may have been affected by ‚Äúall the stories‚Äù surrounding the 29-year-old. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that Mo wants to score,‚Äù Klopp added, ‚Äúespecially in this moment.‚Äù What could he have meant? And what did Salah mean when he told Sky Sports that ""there are many things that people don't know"" about his contractual situation? Are there serious issues there? And if so, can they be resolved? Sources insist there have been no developments on that front despite reports last week suggesting Salah was ready to drop his wage demands and pen a four-year deal. There remains, on both sides, a belief that a compromise will eventually be found, but for now we can expect the speculation to continue. It is unlikely, to say the least, that Salah will be dropped for Liverpool‚Äôs visit to Manchester City, but even the fact that one national newspaper ran a piece on its website this week debating the idea is telling. Salah has not completed 90 minutes in the Premier League since February 23, and his last 16 games for club and country have yielded only five goals ‚Äì three of which came from the penalty spot. A foot injury, picked up during the win at Brighton last month, hasn‚Äôt helped matters, and there was also the disappointment of Egypt‚Äôs elimination at the hands of Senegal in the World Cup play-off. Mohamed Salah's changing room message to his team-mates after Egypt's loss to Senegal üíî pic.twitter.com/qBXAVx0zqc Salah, who missed a penalty in the decisive shootout in Dakar, is said to have taken the defeat personally, though in typical fashion, he was back at Liverpool‚Äôs training ground less than 12 hours later, ready to get back to work for his club. That determination and professionalism is, in Klopp‚Äôs eyes at least, Salah‚Äôs greatest asset, and it is that which will ensure that this mini-slump remains exactly that and nothing more. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a tough period,‚Äù the Reds boss said in Lisbon, ‚Äúbut everything will be fine.‚Äù Sunday may well be the ideal fixture in which to show that. Victory at the Etihad would send Liverpool top of the Premier League and, with seven weeks of the campaign remaining, would fuel belief that an unprecedented ‚Äòquadruple‚Äô really might be possible for Klopp and his side. Salah‚Äôs record against City is excellent: he has scored seven times against Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side, including four in his last five appearances. Who could forget that mesmeric, slaloming effort when the sides drew 2-2 at Anfield back in October? The goalscoring form of Diogo Jota, and the way that Luis Diaz has settled in seamlessly since his January move from Porto, means Klopp has greater attacking options than ever before. However, it would be a shock if Liverpool‚Äôs starting line-up did not include both Salah and Sadio Mane, and plenty would opt for Roberto Firmino as the third forward too, although the Brazilian was noticeably absent from the training pictures released by the club on Friday. Salah was there, of course, complete with a beaming smile. If the pressure is getting to him, he‚Äôs hiding it well enough. He‚Äôd love a goal and a big performance this weekend, mind, and if he wants a little inspiration he need look back only three years, to April 2019, when an eight-game scoreless run was ended with a memorable strike away at Southampton. A repeat on Sunday? You wouldn‚Äôt bet against it. The best never stay quiet for too long, after all. Liverpool need Salah at his loudest at the Etihad. If he is, the title is theirs for the taking.

The board will just have to hope that Saturday's embarrassingly tame 1-0 loss at Everton did not terrify the current Ajax boss to the point of putting him off agreeing to become their next permanent manager. The typically vocal United away following could only watch on in silence as their team produced an insipid display against a team who are in real danger of relegation from the Premier League. Ralf Rangnick was brought in to steady the sinking ship, with United having been in freefall under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but with the team applying themselves in this manner, the German would have to be Harry Houdini to conjure up a top-four finish at this stage. Seventh-placed United still have seven games to play, so Champions League qualification is not mathematically impossible, but it now feels that way, given the ineffective nature of their performances. Remember, Rangnick's side still have to face Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea and, right now, there is no guarantee they will even have enough to get past basement boys Norwich next weekend. The United boss had said in his pre-match press conference that he took great encouragement from what he had seen in training this week, that the physicality and aggression that had been lacking in last weekend‚Äôs draw against Leicester would be present at Goodison Park. However, there was no sign of either attribute against Everton, with his players failing dismally to stand up and be counted. Everton 1-0 Manchester United üò≥ pic.twitter.com/4sbqnvEomX With just two minutes on the lock, Harry Maguire knocked the ball out of play while under no pressure at all, and that inexplicable error set the tone for United‚Äôs display. Marcus Rashford, starting on his favoured left-hand side, was their brightest attacking spark, but even he dulled as the half went on, and he ended up being switched to the opposite flank. The tension inside Goodison was palpable, with Everton's loss at Burnley in midweek having left them just one point above the drop zone at kick-off. However, when Anthony Gordon‚Äôs 20-yard strike deflected off Maguire and into the United net, the roar was deafening, but even with Everton growing into the game, that excitement level didn‚Äôt last. It was a nervous energy from the home support and it filtered onto the pitch. This was a team with five defeats in their last six games and it showed: Frank Lampard‚Äôs side were desperately poor in possession ‚Äì they had still enough to beat a gutless United side. Manchester United fans watching this game like üò© pic.twitter.com/aerFS9aSco Rangnick stood on the touchline in his mauve jumper gesturing to his players to push further up the pitch but it made no difference. Collectively, United's players once again lacked drive and commitment. They should have capitalised on the home side‚Äôs anxiety and mistakes; instead, they played into their hands by making basic errors of their own. The touches were heavy, the movement wasn‚Äôt quick enough, the attacking ideas were not there, there was no desire and certainly no fight. Before football returned after the last international break, the hope from inside the club was that a rejuvenated United would finish the season on the high and secure Champions League football. The way they‚Äôre going, though, and with tougher tests coming up, they‚Äôll be lucky if they qualify for any European competition at all next season.

The Camp Nou outfit were forced to fight back from an early second-half deficit and a trio of penalty concessions to come away with the three points. The match appeared destined for stalemate until De Jong provided the crucial finish seconds out from the final whistle and afterwards, his coach was quick to hail him and goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who saved a spot-kick, as top-level performers. ""One of the keys is Marc's save and another is Luuk's goal,"" Xavi told Movistar+. ""These are details that ultimately count. That's why we have a great goalkeeper and a great striker. They've made a great effort. ""The first half wasn't good at all. The team seemed mentally and physically fatigued. Playing on Thursday still weighed us down. In the second half we were much better. ""The team has settled in well. By working and believing until the end, things are achieved. Luuk's work is giving us a lot. He is a great professional and he deserves it."" The Blaugrana's remarkable revival under their former player has led to suggestions that they could be a dark horse contender for the title in La Liga, with a 12-point gap to leaders Real Madrid look potentially doable. But Xavi has cautioned such thoughts, adding: ""The dynamic is very positive and we have to keep going [but] the league is very difficult because Madrid do not fail. ""They have difficult games and so do we. If they drop a point in these two weeks, maybe we can believe something more."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Ibrahima Sissoko gave the hosts a first-half lead but the Indomitable Lion netted a last-gasp equaliser to salvage a point for his side in the matchday 31 fixture at Stade de la Meinau.  It was Toko Ekambi‚Äôs eighth goal of the season for Lyon who occupy the 10th position on the league table.  Strasbourg, meanwhile, sit fourth on the log.  While the Cameroonian was the only African player in Lyon‚Äôs first XI, the hosts‚Äô starting set-up featured Ghana defender Djiku and Cote d‚ÄôIvoire midfielder Jean-Eudes Aholou.  Sissoko broke the deadlock in the 20th minute, beating an offside trap to head home from Ludovic Ajorque‚Äôs perfectly-weighted delivery into the box.  It was then agony after agony for the visitors as Anthony Lopes and Houssem Aouar had to be replaced in the 30th and 62nd minutes, respectively, due to injury.  As though there had not been enough forced substitutions in the game already, Strasbourg‚Äôs Anthony Caci had to go off for Frederic Guilbert in the 74th minute due to injury.  Ten minutes later, Lyon were forced into another injury-induced substitution as Tanguy Ndombele went off for Jeff Reine-Adelaide.  The hosts appeared on course to win all three points until the 90th minute when Toko Ekambi pounced on a loose ball at the far post to stab home the equaliser from close range after Strasbourg‚Äôs defence failed to appropriately clear a cross into the box.  The Cameroonian played for the entirety of the game, as did Djiku for Strasbourg but Aholou was hauled off in the 70th minute.  Zimbabwe striker Tino Kadewere came on for OL in the 62nd minute but Senegal forward Habib Diallo and Mali attacker Dion Moise Sahi were both unused substitutes.  Strasbourg will be hoping to return to winning ways in their next match against Troyes while Lyon will have a similar ambition when they take on Bordeaux.  Both Toko Ekambi and Djiku are expected to feature for Cameroon and Ghana, respectively, at the World Cup in Qatar later this year.  Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

12,https://www.goal.com/en/news/how-mane-and-salah-inspired-liverpool-against-manchester/blte24cbce8a6013d59,How Mane and Salah inspired Liverpool against Manchester City,"Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah accentuated their importance to Liverpool in Sunday‚Äôs 2-2 Premier League draw versus Manchester City. Although the Reds made a false start at the Etihad Stadium, they ensured that the thriller ended on a no winner, no vanquished note. While birthday boy Mane was on target - his 13th strike of the 2021-22 campaign, Salah was the architect. With the game just five minutes old, Kevin De Bruyne fired the hosts ahead while Trent Alexander-Arnold set up Diogo Jota for the leveller eight minutes later. Nine minutes before the half time break, the Citizen took the lead through Gabriel Jesus thanks to Joao Cancelo‚Äôs last pass. Mane ensured that the thriller ended all square with his fine strike just 46 seconds into the second half, which saw him a record only achieved by former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney. Interestingly, the Senegal international‚Äôs effort came from his only shot at goal while making one key pass, winning one aerial ball with 41 touches to his credit. He was fouled thrice, caught offside once while making 26 passes with a passing accuracy of 84.6 percent. Defensively, he contributed just one tackle and one interception. After playing for 84 minutes, he was replaced by Brazil international Roberto Firmino. For Egypt‚Äôs Salah, statistics showed that he put up an incredible display against the reigning English kings. Although he could only muster just one shot, he made three key passes, 46 touches and a passing accuracy of 87 percent. In addition, he made three top tackles and committed one foul but he was dispossessed on three occasions. He was a thorn in the flesh of City defenders - little wonder he played all 90 minutes alongside former Cameroon international Joel Matip. Even with the result, Liverpool remain second on the log having garnered 73 points from 31 matches. The Africans are expected to be in action when Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs men take on Manchester United on April 19 in their next league fixture. Prior to that potential cracker, they would help the club see off Benfica and Manchester City in the Champions League and FA Cup, respectively. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Klopp's team went in 2-1 behind at the break in the clash with the Premier League leaders, with Diogo Jota scoring for the visitors and Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus giving the home team the advantage. Klopp used his side's 13th-minute strike to inspire his players ahead of the second half and they went on to score the crucial equaliser one minute after the restart to secure a 2-2 draw. Asked what he told his players at half-time, Klopp told Sky Sports: ""We showed [our] goal because it was a really good football situation which if we did more we would have chances. ""I was convinced we could win this game. They were much more direct than us today. They had a more direct idea than us and we wanted to let them run when in possession. ""Defensively we were sometimes in a rush, they put us under pressure and we can defend these situations better. ""The second half was really intense, they needed breaks as well, but their counter attacks are not bad. Their decision making is really good and they always pick the right player. ""I think it is a completely fine and deserved draw. We wanted to make sure they see my boys are exceptional as well."" The Reds remain one point behid Pep Guardiola's team with seven games left to play in the Premier League. Klopp's men face Benfica in the second-leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie in midweek before they come up against City once more in the FA Cup semi-finals on Saturday. After that, they face Manchester United at Anfield as they resume Premier League duty. ""Seven games to go for both teams and we will not stop chasing now that's for sure,"" Klopp said. ""Let's make sure we are ready for Benfica, for this team at Wembley [in the FA Cup] and then we will see who will have the better finish."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Senegal international, who turned 30 on Sunday, was among the goal scorers as Liverpool played out a 2-2 draw away from home against league leaders Manchester City. Named in the Reds‚Äô starting XI - his 28th appearance in the 2021-22 campaign, the former Southampton star helped his team leave the Etihad Stadium with a share of the points with his second half equaliser. Liverpool‚Äôs Sadio Man√© celebrates his 30th birthday today ‚Äì he is only the second player in Premier League history to score on his birthday against a team starting the day top of the table, after Wayne Rooney in October 2004 against Arsenal on his 19th birthday. #MCILIV pic.twitter.com/98FaGk6Vax In the keenly contested fixture, Belgium international Kevin De Bruyne put Pep Guardiola's team ahead as early as the fifth minute having been set up by Bernardo Silva. Nonetheless, the lead lasted for just eight minutes with Diogo Jota restoring parity for the visiting side thanks to an assist from Trent Alexander-Arnold. In the goal-laden first half, Gabriel Jesus ensured that the hosts went into the half time break with the lead as he beat goalkeeper Alisson in the 36th minute. Knowing that anything short of victory would spell doom in their quest to emerge as league champions, Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side stepped up their game in the second half. Just a minute after resumption, Mane put Liverpool on level terms courtesy of Mohamed Salah‚Äôs last pass. Thanks to that effort, the reigning African Player of the Year joined the Manchester United great in the hallowed ranks of the English top flight with his unique feat. In addition, the goal which came just 46 seconds into the second half was the first time the Anfield kings had scored in the opening minute of the second half in a league game since January 2019 (Mohamed Salah vs Crystal Palace). Interestingly, it was the first time the Citizens had conceded in the 46th minute in an English top-flight game since November 2004 against Norwich City - with Damien Francis the scorer. Even at his impressive showing, Mane was subbed off for Roberto Firmino with six minutes left on the clock. Whereas, Egypt's captain Salah was on parade from start to finish. For Guinea‚Äôs Naby Keita, he was thrown into the fray for Jordan Henderson in the 78th minute while Mali prospect Ibrahima Konate was an unused substitute. Following this outcome, just one point separates the teams at the Premier League's summit with seven matches left. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Mahrez attempted to chip Reds keeper Alisson with effectively the final attack of the game from the hosts at the Etihad Stadium, only to miscue his shot and put it well over the target, ensuring that the spoils were shared in a 2-2 draw. The opportunity to win and put four points between City and their title rivals was not lost on De Bruyne, but the Belgium international was quick to praise his side's combined effort in taking another step towards a potential title defence. De Bruyne, who earlier scored his side's opener, was the one who provided the through ball to Mahrez in the late stages of the game. It was a difficult opportunity to be sure, but one Mahrez has converted in the past. ""It's a great chance,"" De Bruyne told Sky Sports in his post-match comments. ""Riyad chose to chip and if it goes in, it's a wonder goal. ""[But] today we played very well, I think we had the upper hand. This is the way we need to play the rest of the season. Mahrez had a great chance to win the match for City in stoppage time but his effort goes high over the bar. #MCILIV | #MyPLMorning pic.twitter.com/p8gLr0C6y3 Asked on whether the points benefit City or Liverpool more, the Belgian added: ""It's similar. I know people said whoever wins gets the title. But it's too hard. The schedule is too tough for both teams to win every game, but we will try."" Pep Guardiola, meanwhile, told BBC: ""I don't have any regrets. They can miss whatever they want. It was positive. It is football and it happens.

The Ivory Coast international reduced the deficit from the penalty spot in the 65th minute after the Foxes had taken a 2-0 lead courtesy of Ademola Lookman in the 39th minute and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall in the 45th minute.  Despite the defeat at King Power Stadium, the 29-year-old, who had also scored in his last match from the penalty spot against Arsenal, wrote history as having scored more top-flight goals against Leicester than he has versus any other side in the competition (seven).  His effort against Leicester was full of drama as he had to retake the penalty. In his first effort, Leicester‚Äôs Kasper Schmeichel dived the right way to punch out the ball.  However, the referee ordered a retake since Schmeichel had encroached on Zaha‚Äôs spot-kick and he was handed another chance to score, this time his effort was saved again but he pounced on the rebound to head home. Crystal Palace‚Äôs Wilfried Zaha has scored more Premier League goals against Leicester than he has versus any other side in the competition  ‚öΩ#StatAttack pic.twitter.com/qlZ7VZfWoj Zaha has now scored 11 Premier League so far in this campaign from 26 appearances.  Speaking after the game, Palace manager Patrick Vieira was not happy with the performance of his side.  ""We are not too low. We weren‚Äôt too high after Arsenal. It‚Äôs important for us to find consistency game after game, that will allow us to be an improved team,‚Äù Vieira told the club‚Äôs official website.  ""We‚Äôve come a long way from the first game v Chelsea to now. We are in a better place. There is still a lot we have to learn and that will come with time.  ""We know there are details we need to improve but sometimes those details come with time‚Ä¶ the more those players play together they‚Äôll be improving. I was really happy against Arsenal and today we lost, disappointed, but there‚Äôs still positives.""  The former Arsenal midfielder, however, reserved praise for two substitutes Eberechi Eze and James McArthur.  ‚ÄúI was really pleased because I thought they brought more passes forward and more tempo and that allow us to create a couple more chances,‚Äù continued.  Zaha and Palace will now turn their focus to the FA Cup semi-final clash against Chelsea at Wembley on April 17. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Eagles headed into the game having won their last fixture 3-0 against Arsenal but they found themselves trailing in the 39th minute when Nigeria international Ademola Lookman scored for the Foxes after being teed up by Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall.  Dewsbury-Hall then doubled the lead in the 45th minute before Ivory Coast international Wilfried Zaha reduced the deficit from the penalty spot in the 65th minute after Ayew was fouled by Youri Tielemans.  The Ghana international thinks Palace were undone after conceding two first-half goals.  ‚ÄúI feel like we didn‚Äôt start the game well. It was all about the start... We paid the price and conceded two goals,‚Äù Ayew told reporters after the game as quoted by the club‚Äôs official website.  ‚ÄúIn the second-half we were the much better team. We didn‚Äôt give up, we pushed, but we didn‚Äôt manage to come back which is the most important thing. It‚Äôs a wake-up call for us to know the importance for us to have a really good start of the game and to build on that.  ‚ÄúThe most important thing is it happened now and not against Chelsea. Now we have one week to prepare for Chelsea and we‚Äôll do the best we can.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the message from the manager and it was quite simple and short: it‚Äôs a good wake-up call and we prepare ourselves for the next game the best we can.‚Äù  Ayew has further described the result as ""a wake-up call"" as they prepare to face Chelsea in the semi-finals of the FA Cup.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a wake-up call, so we need to be consistent and need to work on that. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre trying to do; we‚Äôve come out of a very good run and this is a wake-up call,‚Äù Ayew continued.  ‚ÄúThe most important thing is it happened today, not next week, so we can build on this and know it‚Äôs important to have a good start to the game.‚Äù  The former Swansea City player also dwelled on the penalty, insisting it was well-deserved and that Zaha did well to score from the retake.  ‚ÄúI think I just did a stepover and he [Youri Tielemans] went and put his leg and caught me. It‚Äôs as simple as that,‚Äù added Ayew.  ‚ÄúThe most important thing is he scored ‚Äì that‚Äôs the most important thing and there‚Äôs nothing to complain about. He did the most important thing: put it in the back of the net.‚Äù  The Cup fixture against Chelsea will be played at Wembley Stadium on April 17.

The loss means Luciano Spalletti's side were unable to grab the points that would have taken them to the top of the league table ahead of AC Milan and Inter Milan. Fiorentina went ahead in the 29th minute when Nicolas Gonzalez struck to open the score. Napoli equalized in the 58th minute when Dries Mertens ‚Äì with an assist from the Nigerian ‚Äì found the back of the net with a low drive. It was an instant impact from Mertens, who had just replaced Fabian Ruiz two minutes before he equalized for the home side. However, Fiorentina restored the lead in the 66th minute when French international Jonathan Ikone scored ‚Äì just a minute after joining the action ‚Äì with an assist provided by Gonzalez. Dominant Fiorentina added the third when Arthur Cabral found the back of the net with an assist from Morocco‚Äôs midfielder, Youssef Maleh. Napoli continued to fight and in the 84th minute, Osimhen scored their second, with Mario Rui providing the assist for the Super Eagles forward. Osimhen continues to be a dependable goalscorer for the Italian outfit as he recently scored twice against Verona and Udinese on March 13 and 19, respectively. Apart from the Ruiz-Mertens change, Napoli made other substitutions that involved Hirving Lozano, Eljif Elmas, Diego Demme, and Faouzi Ghoulam coming on for Matteo Politano, Lorenzo Insigne, Stanislav Lobotka, and Rui. On the other hand, Fiorentina‚Äôs changes saw Ikone, Maleh, Jose Callejon, Lucas Martinez, and Aleksandr Kokorin come on for Riccardo Saponara, Joseph Duncan, Gonzalez, Igor Julio, and Cabral, respectively. Nikola Milenkovic, Cabral, and Ikone were the players who were yellow-carded on the part of Fiorentina, while none of Napoli‚Äôs players were cautioned.

We may receive a commission on any sales we generate from it The 2022 World Cup in Qatar will get under way on November 21, with superstar performers from across the planet readying themselves for a shot at global glory in the Middle East. France, after emerging victorious on Russian soil back in 2018, will be the defending champions, but a number of nations have their sights set on knocking Les Bleus from the loftiest of perches. In total, 32 countries will compete for the ultimate prize on football‚Äôs grandest stage, but who are favourites to go all the way and which of the outsiders could spring a surprise? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ Brazil may not have savoured World Cup glory since 2002, but they are five-time winners and currently boast the strength in depth - with the likes of Neymar, Vinicius Junior and Alisson at their disposal - to make them 9/2 (5.50) favourites in Qatar. Holders France are another of those that are well fancied to mount a serious challenge for the ultimate prize, with a star-studded squad that includes Kylian Mbappe and Paul Pogba knowing what it takes to emerge victorious, and Didier Deschamps' side are available at 11/2 (6.50). England made their way to the semi-finals in 2018, before reaching a final on home soil at Euro 2020, and the Three Lions are also 11/2 (6.50) to bring a 56-year wait for international success to a close. Just behind them at 8/1 (9.00) are 2010 winners Spain, who have an exciting young squad at their disposal, while Argentina ‚Äì who are hoping to see Lionel Messi land the one major honour that has so far eluded him in a remarkable career - are priced at 9/1 (10.00) just ahead of perennial challengers Germany at 11/1 (12.00). Belgium, who have slipped from the top of the FIFA world rankings, may feel that 2022 presents their golden generation ‚Äì with the likes of Kevin De Bruyne and Eden Hazard still going strong ‚Äì with a last shot at international honours, but they are priced at 12/1 (13.00). Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal - who came through the play-offs - are another of those available at 12/1 (13.00), alongside a Netherlands team that are bursting with potential. Denmark, who have welcomed Christian Eriksen back into their ranks following his cardiac arrest at Euro 2020, are considered to be 28/1 (29.00) shots for what would be a stunning and very emotional triumph. Croatia reached the final in 2018, as Luka Modric closed in on Ballon d‚ÄôOr glory, but are 50/1 (51.00) to go one better four years on. Uruguay ‚Äì who still have the vast experience and considerable goal threat of Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez in their ranks ‚Äì are also available at 50/1 (51.00), with Switzerland and reigning Africa Cup of Nations champions Senegal priced at 80/1 (81.00). The United States, with youthful exuberance on their side, are not expected to figure in the final shake-up as they sit at 100/1 (101.00), with a Poland squad led by prolific Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski priced at 125/1 (126.00). There are a number of teams at 150/1 (151.00), including Mexico and Canada, while hosts Qatar have drifted out to 350/1 (351.00) as they become serious long shots on home soil.

All you need to know about the award,"Former Barcelona captain and club legend Lionel Messi is the all-time highest goalscorer in the history of LaLiga. In the 17 years Messi spent in the league (2004 to 2021), he scored 474 goals in 520 LaLiga appearances. He has won the Pichichi trophy - an award given to the highest goalscorer of LaLiga in a season - the most number of times, eight. The Argentine also won the trophy on five consecutive occasions (2016 to 2021). Named after former Athletic Bilbao forward Rafael Moreno Aranzadi or Pichichi, the trophy is awarded to the top goalscorer of the LaLiga. The award was first given during the 1952-53 season and former Athletic Bilbao forward Telmo Zarra won the inaugural award scoring 24 goals in 29 matches during the season. The award is given by leading Spanish sports newspaper Marca. Lionel Messi has won the trophy on eight occasions, the most in the history of the league. He last won the trophy in his final season with Barcelona in the 2020-21 campaign scoring 30 goals.

25,https://www.goal.com/en/news/how-has-lionel-messi-performed-in-world-cups/blt7ddbf0b47f7b8edb,How has Lionel Messi performed in World Cups?,"Lionel Messi finally quenched his thirst for winning an international trophy in July 2021 when he led Argentina to a Copa America title with a win over Brazil in the final. He has also won every single trophy that exists in club football with his former employers Barcelona, however, his quest to win the biggest prize, the World Cup, continues. Messi has participated in every edition of the showpiece event since 2006 and will be playing in his fifth World Cup in Qatar which is set to kick off on November 21, 2022. The Argentine made his World Cup debut against Serbia and Montenegro on June 16, 2006 in Argentina's second group stage match. La Albiceleste won the tie 6-0 with Messi scoring on his World Cup debut after coming on as a substitute. In the next match against Netherlands, Messi started for the first time in a World Cup match. The game ended in a goalless draw. They faced Mexico in the Round of 16 where Messi came on as a substitute in the 84th minute. The South American giants won the match 2-1 in extra time and booked their place in the quarterfinal. They were finally ousted by Germany in the quarterfinal losing in the penalty shootout. Messi did not feature in Argentina's final game. In total he played three matches and scored one goal. In 2010, Argentina once again crashed out in the quarterfinal after losing to Germany 4-0. Messi had a lukewarm campaign as he failed to score even once despite playing in all five matches.  The 2014 World Cup turned out to be one of the finest campaigns in Messi's international career for La Albiceleste. The former Barcelona star bagged the Golden Ball Award despite losing to Germany in the final. But enroute final, Messi scored four goals in seven matches and almost single-handedly took them to the final. In 2018, Messi once again had a forgettable outing. He managed to score only one goal in four matches as Argentina crashed out from the round of 16 after losing to eventual champions France 4-2. He had even missed a penalty in a group stage tie against Iceland.

Despite failing to score in his last two matches for the Blaugrana, the former Arsenal man was named in Xavi‚Äôs starting line-up in the five-goal thriller. He justified his manager‚Äôs faith in him by scoring a goal as Alessio Lisci‚Äôs men were beaten before their home fans inside Estadio Ciutat de Valencia. After a goalless first half, the hosts were awarded a penalty in the 52nd minute when referee Jose Munuera pointed to the spot after a goal-bound Son was fouled by Dani Alves in the box. Jose Morales stepped up to take the ensuing kick to send goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen the wrong way. Another penalty clicked for the Frogs four minutes later following Gavi‚Äôs handball, but Ter Stegen was well-positioned to save Roger Marti‚Äôs tame shot. A minute before the hour mark, Aubameyang restored parity for the visitors as headed Ousmane Dembele‚Äôs delightful cross past Dani Cardenas. In the 63rd minute, Xavi‚Äôs side went ahead for the first time thanks to Pedri‚Äôs well-taken strike. With seven minutes left on the clock, Levante were awarded a third penalty, as Clement Lengletit was penalised for a clumsy foul. Gonzalo Melero stepped up to confidently put the encounter level. Nevertheless, super-sub Luuk de Jong had the final say to head home Jordi Alba‚Äôs glancing header in the 92nd-minute, to seal all points for the Catalans. Apart from his goal, the African was impressive before he was finally subbed off for De Jong in the 84th minute. His goal came from his only shot in the high-scoring affair while accounting for 25 touches, and 15 passes with a passing accuracy of 80%. Whereas, he did not add any value to Barcelona defensively with statistics showing he scored zero judging by top tackles, clearances, and blocked shots. The 26-time Spanish elite division champions have now moved to second in the log with 60 points from 30 matches. Unbeaten in their last 14 matches in all competitions, they welcome Cadiz to Camp Nou on April 18. Prior to that, Xavi‚Äôs men will square up against Eintracht Frankfurt in Europa League.

Shortly after his comments, the 21-year-old was included in Manchester City's starting XI as the reigning Premier League champions host Liverpool on Sunday. Aguero expects great things from his former City team-mate as he believes he is an ""incredible talent"". ""As always, my favourite player changed the game [against Atletico]: Phil Foden,"" Aguero said on TyC. ""I don't know what the issue is like, but Pep, put him on the pitch a little more. Now that I don't play anymore, I can say it! ""The kid tears it up, I told you. One day you asked me who I liked and I told you Foden."" He told Stake: ‚ÄúPhil Foden is an incredible talent and his assist for Kevin De Bruyne was an example of what he can create out of nowhere. ‚ÄúHe could be the best English talent of his generation. ‚ÄúHe has so much quality and it‚Äôs easy to forget he is still only 21, with so much time to learn and get better.‚Äù Foden has featured 35 times for the Premier League champions this season, scoring 11 times and registering seven assists. He was one of the stars of the show as City beat Atletico Madrid in the first-leg of their Champions League quarter-final first leg in midweek. He provided the assist for Kevin De Bruyne as the English side picked up a 1-0 win to give them the advantage in the game. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

28,https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-is-st-totteringhams-day-arsenal-spurs-top-four-premier/lsnbmicl82jbz4ymppbp9xng,What is St Totteringham's Day? Arsenal & Spurs top four Premier League taunt explained,"When it comes to the rivalry between Arsenal and Tottenham, it is fair to say that the Gunners have had more to shout about. With 13 league titles and 14FA Cups, Arsenal's trophy cabinet requires a lot more polish than that of Spurs, who have eight FA Cup wins to their name and last won England's top prize in 1961. And, even though Spurs boast a greater number of continental trophies, Arsenal have been much more of a fixture in the likes of the Champions League and Europa League. Winning more trophies than Tottenham is not the only concern for Arsenal fans each season though. These days there is a day of celebration which does not even involve silverware. It is called St Totteringham's Day. If you are not sure what that is, do not worry as GOAL brings you everything you need to know right here. St Totteringham's Day is the name given to the day on which it becomes mathematically impossible for Tottenham to finish above Arsenal in the Premier League. It is a time of celebration for Arsenal fans, who find themselves in a position to gloat about the superiority of their team as officially confirmed by the composition of the league table. The concept is believed to have been born in 2002, when it appeared on the Arsenal fan website 'Arseweb', but it did not become mainstream until 2010. Since then, St Totteringham's Day has been a common feature in discussions related to the north London derby. It might come as a disappointment to some to learn that there is no such saint as St Totteringham. The name of the unofficial 'holiday' is a portmanteau of Tottenham and the adjective 'tottering', which Merriam-Webster defines as ""being in an unstable condition"". Given the nature of the celebration, the date of St Totteringham's Day changes each year and (whisper it if you are an Arsenal fan) sometimes does not occur at all. When it does happen, the date tends to fall in March, April or May. During the tenure of Arsene Wenger as Arsenal boss, it became something of an inevitability and Gunners fans were able to celebrate finishing ahead of Spurs for a remarkable uninterrupted period of 21 years. Gunners supporters even began singing a song created to bask in their dominance, known as 'It's Happened Again', which goes: ""It's happened again / It's happened again / Tottenham Hotspur, it's happened again."" However, the tide has been turning since the final years of Wenger's reign and Tottenham ensured that the holiday was cancelled in the 2016-17 season, doing so in emphatic fashion by beating the Gunners 2-0 at White Hart Lane. There was no St Totteringham's Day in 2017-18 either as Spurs finished third, a massive 14 points ahead of Arsenal, who ended the campaign in sixth place. Nor was there a St Totteringham's Day in 2019-20 - when Spurs finished sixth, three points ahead of the Gunners - and again in 2020-21 when white prevailed over red in north London by a solitary point. One of the most memorable St Totteringham's Days for Arsenal fans came in the 2015-16 season when Wenger's side leapfrogged Spurs on the final day of the campaign. Mauricio Pochettino's side needed only to avoid defeat against already-relegated Newcastle United in order to finish the season ahead of their rivals, but astonishingly lost 5-1 while the Gunners beat Aston Villa 4-0. The earliest St Totteringham's Day happened on March 9, 2008 when Arsenal completed the feat with nine games remaining. They actually did it with 10 games to spare during the year of The Invincibles, but the date itself was March 13, 2004 - four days later than in 2008. The 2012-13 season saw the latest ever St Totteringham's Day with the Gunners finishing ahead of Spurs in the final game of the season on May 19. There does not appear to be an accepted Tottenham equivalent to Arsenal's St Totteringham's Day, though Spurs fans undoubtedly take great pleasure in finishing above their fiercest rivals in the league. When Tottenham 'cancelled' St Totteringham's Day in 2017, the Telegraph indicated that the name ""St Arse's Day"" had been mooted as a possible name for an equivalent unofficial feast day. However, that does not seem to have caught on. St Hotspur Day - the name given to the day when Tottenham defeated Arsenal in the 1991 FA Cup semi-final - could arguably be considered an equivalent to St Totteringham's Day. Part of the reason St Totteringham's Day became a thing was Arsenal's dominance during the late 1990s into the 2010s when Gunners fans became accustomed to finishing ahead of Spurs. Tottenham have come roaring back in more recent times and, if they can maintain that in the coming years, perhaps a new holiday title will emerge.

A Catalan coach at the Etihad Stadium has enjoyed success wherever he has been, with domestic title triumphs enjoyed in Spain, Germany and England while also savouring Champions League success while at Barcelona. He has delivered major silverware at City on an annual basis, and remains in the hunt for three trophies this season, but Hamman says the 51-year-old is not as good as his reputation in world football suggests ‚Äì with there three other proven winners that sit above him in a global pecking order. Hamann has told the Daily Mail ahead of a crunch Premier League clash between title-chasing City and Liverpool: ‚ÄúThere are three current managers who I regard as more successful than Guardiola and I still don‚Äôt really get the hype that surrounds him. ‚ÄúJose Mourinho has won league titles in four different countries and the Champions League with two clubs, while Carlo Ancelotti‚Äôs record is second to none and about to get better if Real Madrid can win La Liga. ‚ÄúAnd the third manager? For me, it‚Äôs Jurgen Klopp. What he has achieved on the budgets he has at Liverpool is remarkable. He is a truly exceptional manager. His great skill is in integrating players which is a talent Guardiola doesn‚Äôt possess in quite the same way. ‚ÄúWhen Klopp signed Diogo Jota last season everyone questioned whether he would get anywhere near the team, but he was immediately involved. It‚Äôs been exactly the same with Luis Diaz. ‚ÄúIn fact, compare the case of Diaz to Jack Grealish and it goes some way to showing the difference between the managers. We‚Äôve seen players come into the Premier League and you often need six to eight weeks to adjust because it‚Äôs a unique game. Diaz came in and he fired immediately because the style suits him. ‚ÄúLook on the other side, you‚Äôve got Grealish, who cost three times as much yet is struggling to make any sort of an impact. He‚Äôs a ¬£100 million player yet he still isn‚Äôt fully integrated. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have a go at my old club City, who have done fantastic things, they have invested massively, done great things in the community, transformed the area around the stadium. It‚Äôs the manager. ‚ÄúThe way Liverpool players speak about their manager, they would run through brick walls for him. I‚Äôm not sure City‚Äôs players would do the same.‚Äù Guardiola won three La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey and two Champions League crowns while at Barcelona, along with the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup. He went on to land three Bundesliga titles at Bayern Munich, while also savouring Super Cup and Club World Cup glory again. City appointed him as their boss in the summer of 2016 and after a rare trophyless debut campaign under a man tied to a contract through to 2023, have tasted top-flight glory on three occasions while also winning the FA Cup once and the Carabao Cup on four occasions. Guardiola has 31 trophies to his name in total, ranking him above Mourinho, Klopp and Ancelotti on an all-time coaching honours chart. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Sane made his 40th appearance of the season for Bayern against Augsburg on Saturday, but came off for Kingsley Coman in the 65th minute after failing to make an impact on the game. The reigning Bundesliga champions went on to win 1-0 thanks to a late Robert Lewandowski penalty, and Nagelsmann offered his thoughts on Sane's recent form after the final whistle. The Bayern boss feels the 26-year-old winger is going through a period of inconsistency that has been typical of his career so far, but he still has full faith in his abilities. ""I like Leroy very much, as a person and as a player. Everyone knows that he has incredible qualities,"" Nagelsmann told GOAL and SPOX. ""He is self-critical enough and knows himself that he hasn't recently played well. I don't know exactly why. ""He's had ups and downs throughout his career. I support him completely."" Sane was visibly frustrated after being substituted and seemed to shake Nagelsmann's hand half-heartedly before heading to the bench, but the German coach won't be dwelling on his reaction. ""I'm not angry, we don't have to make a headline out of it,"" he added. Sane has been a key part of Nagelsmann's plans since he was drafted in to replace Hansi Flick in the managerial hot seat at Allianz Arena last summer. The former Manchester City star has recorded an impressive 14 goals and 15 assists so far this season, but has now gone five without a goal contribution in the Bundesliga. Bayern fans will hope that Sane can rediscover his best form when they play host to Villarreal in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday, with the Spanish side 1-0 up on aggregate after the first leg.

Leading sides from across Europe, including many from the Premier League, are reportedly readying summer raids on Estadio da Luz for a frontman that has netted 31 times in all competitions this season. At just 22 years of age, Nunez is being targeted as a shrewd addition for the present and future, with his star very much on the rise, but his current employers in Portugal are eager to point out that he will not come cheap and that there is no guarantee of a sale being sanctioned in 2022. Verissimo has told reporters when asked whether Nunez, who continues to be scouted by striker-needy sides from England, could generate a fee similar to former Benfica forward Felix: ‚ÄúWhat do you think? Darwin is an excellent player, he has shown all his quality. He has helped the team a lot, it is true that the team has also helped him a lot. ‚ÄúHe is a young player with a lot of potential, it is natural that given what has been his growth throughout this season and also a lot as a result of the performance he has had in the Champions League games, it is natural that he arouses the interest of the big European clubs. ‚ÄúIt will be at the end of this season or the following season, depending on what he has shown, it is natural that it will arouse interest from other clubs and naturally there may be the time in which he goes. Now regarding numbers, I hope as a Benfica fan that he will go for numbers close to those that were Joao Felix's numbers. Now it's not for me to enter numbers on that field. ‚ÄúIn what is my day to day with the player, in what is given to us to observe in training and in the games, naturally we are looking at a top player and all the top players arouse the interest of the big European clubs. Darwin is on that list, obviously.‚Äù Darwin Nunez's 26th goal of the season fired Benfica to the Champions League quarter-finals ü§© pic.twitter.com/YNlK3QgLIr Nunez joined Benfica from Spanish side Almeria in September 2020 and has hit 45 goals for the club through 80 appearances ‚Äì including a hat-trick on his most recent outing against Belenenses and a Champions League effort in the first leg of a quarter-final clash with Liverpool. He is fully aware of the interest that he is generating and recently revealed that he will be leaving the Equipo TMA agency that he has been working with so far. It is reported that the Uruguay international is set to link up with so-called ‚Äòsuper agent‚Äô Jorge Mendes, who already counts Atletico star Felix and five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner Cristiano Ronaldo among his clients.

Goals for Kevin De Bruyne and Diogo Jota had already put a high-octane match into overdrive, with Alexander-Arnold assisting the latter, while Sadio Mane's second-half strike later rescued a point in a 2-2 draw for the Reds. But the defender was caught short beforehand for City's second, switching off and allowing Jesus to get the run on him for a close-range finish past Alission - and social media was less than impressed with his efforts.

United have now won just one of their last seven matches in all competitions, having dropped out of this year's Champions League at the last-16 stage and lost ground on their domestic rivals.

The Red Devils suffered a 1-0 loss to the Toffees at Goodison Park, dealing a significant blow to their hopes of finishing in the top four this season. The loss comes just days after relegation-threatened Everton lost 3-2 to a Burnley team currently stuck in the Premier League's drop zone. Rangnick admits he found it difficult to explain his team's failure against Frank Lampard's men, especially since the same team were beaten by Burnley a few days prior. He told reporters: ""When we conceded, we lost a little bit of our composure and maybe also a little bit of our confidence and, if you don't score against a team like Everton, with all respect to a team that conceded three goals against Burnley, you cannot expect to get anything out of it. ""We've been talking about that for the last 10 minutes. I totally agree. It is not so difficult to see. ""If you don't score in 95 minutes against a team that conceded three goals against Burnley, and we scored three goals against Tottenham at home, it's difficult to explain. ""For us, as a coaching staff, it's not so easy to understand why we didn't create more chances in a game like this."" United are now in seventh place and sit three points behind Tottenham and Arsenal, who are currently the leading candidates for a place in the Premier League's top four. Rangnick's team have taken just one point from their last three matches in the English top flight. However, they take on the Premier League's bottom team Norwich next week, followed by a trip to Anfield to face title contenders Liverpool three days later. Four days after that, United will meet fellow top-four contenders Arsenal in north London. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

United missed the chance to move level on points with fourth-placed Tottenham after losing 1-0 at Goodison Park on Saturday, with Anthony Gordon grabbing the winning goal for the Toffees. Ralf Rangnick's side only managed four shots on target over the course of the 90 minutes, much to the frustration of De Gea, who felt they once again failed to live up to the required standard at one of the biggest clubs in European football. The Spanish shot-stopper got the impression that Everton wanted the three points more than United and was disappointed by the lack of fight they showed in such an important fixture. ""We knew before today they were struggling and how difficult it was going to be,"" he told BT Sport post-match. ""We don‚Äôt score, we don‚Äôt even create proper chances to score. I don‚Äôt know what to say, to be honest. We‚Äôre not good enough, that‚Äôs for sure. It‚Äôs going to be very difficult now to be in the top four. ""Of course it‚Äôs not the perfect atmosphere. They were tired, they were nervous, but they keep going and keep fighting. They had more desire than us, which is not acceptable. It‚Äôs very sad to lose today. ""It's a disgrace from us, we should be winning this game."" United are already destined to finish the season without a trophy, and are now also in real danger of missing out on Champions League qualification. If Tottenham win their game in hand against Aston Villa they will be six points clear of the Manchester outfit with only seven games remaining, while Arsenal are also currently in a better position. Rangnick will hope that his underperforming team can get back on track and revive their top-four hopes when Norwich arrive at Old Trafford on April 16, three days before the Red Devils are due to take in a trip to Anfield to face quadruple-chasing Liverpool.

Barca slipped to ninth in the table after a poor start under Ronald Koeman, who was sacked in October, with club legend Xavi drafted in the following month as his replacement. Xavi outlined his intention to restore the club's lost identity and, with the help of some shrewd January signings, has gradually lifted the Blaugrana back up into the Champions League places. Barca closed deals for Ferran Torres, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Dani Alves and Adama Traore in the winter window, and all four men have adapted quickly to help the team close the gap on leaders Madrid. A 4-0 Clasico win over the Blancos on March 20 underlined how much they have improved, and Ronaldinho still believes they can finish the campaign as champions. ""We are excited that Barca play well again and I think anything is possible,"" the Brazilian, who won two league titles and the Champions League at Camp Nou between 2003 and 2008, has told Mundo Deportivo. ""I hope so and as a fan I am hoping that things go well and I think there can be [a comeback]."" Ronaldinho went on to praise his former colleague Xavi for the impact he's had since stepping into the dugout. ""Xavi has returned and has brought us hope,"" he added.""As my friend and ex-team-mate, this excites people and me too. ""When he played, he already had a vision of the game as a coach. ""He guided the game and I see it very well [in his coaching] too because he makes us want to watch Barca games again."" Barca are unbeaten in their last 14 La Liga matches, and saw off Sevilla 1-0 last time out to move up to second in the standings on goal difference, albeit temporarily. Sevilla moved back into second on 60 points after beating Granada on Friday, while Madrid picked up a 2-0 victory over Getafe in their latest fixture to move 12 points clear at the top. Barca can cut that gap to nine if they win their two games in hand, starting with a trip to Levante on Sunday, but will only have seven games left to play thereafter.

The veteran forward returned to Old Trafford last summer but has struggled to fire them back to their former glories, with the club set for another season without silverware. Much of the blame has been directed towards Red Devils skipper Maguire, who leads the team over Portugal captain Ronaldo, and Bayern Munich and Canada star Davies admits he cannot believe the centre-back is the man who calls the shots. ""Can you guys imagine [that] you're Ronaldo, right?"" Davies asked his followers on his Twitch channel. ""One of the greatest players ever, in the 21st century. ""Harry Maguire is your captain. You refer to him as captain ‚Äì I don't know what he says to him."" The left-back added: ""I'm not dissing Harry Maguire, but Ronaldo should get the armband, man."" This is not the first time the decision to hand Maguire the captaincy at Old Trafford has made headlines. Indeed, there were reports of a rift in the United camp, with the Daily Mirror having reported that there was a ""power struggle"" taking place. England defender Maguire denied the report on social media back in February, while Ralf Rangnick has continued to support his skipper, despite his below-par performances in the 2021-22 campaign. It seems unlikely that United will now change their captain before the end of the season, although the new manager at Old Trafford, who could well be Erik ten Hag, may have other ideas.

""We knew that'd be how the second half went. It was our third game in a week, we knew the energy levels were going to drop so we had to close the distances. ""And we do know how to win games! Sean didn't mean it in that way - I've spoken to him since. We've won more games than them this year! ""But I understand the sentiment, we've been losing games away from home and he had to motivate his team. I'd say similar things behind the scenes.""

Salah has been a talismanic figure for Liverpool throughout his five-year stay at Anfield, scoring 153 goals in 241 games across all competitions. The Egyptian has helped fire the club to Premier League and Champions League glory, but is now approaching the final year of his contract and speculation over his future is building with each passing week. A number of top clubs have been linked with Salah, including Real Madrid and Barcelona, but the 29-year-old did insist that he would happily spend the remainder of his career at Liverpool back in October. It appears that non-footballing issues are holding up a potential renewal for Salah, who has now given an update on the state of negotations with the club. ""What can I say? There are many things that people don't know about it,"" the forward has told Sky Sports. ""I can't be selfish and talk about my situation, we are in the most important moment for the team."" Asked if he is confident that he will be able to sort out a new contract at Anfield, Salah replied: ""I can't say yes and I can't say no. I've said many times before about what I want but again I can't go deep into my contract right now because it's a sensitive situation and the team needs to win."" The Reds talisman also dismissed any suggestion that the saga is distracting him from his duties on the pitch ahead of a top of the table showdown against Manchester City on Sunday. ""Not at all, I know my job very well and I am very professional,"" he said. ""I'm almost the first one here and the last one to leave, I'm just focusing on the team and winning trophies and giving everything I can to the club."" Klopp offered his take on Salah's contract last month, insisting that the ball is in the Egypt international's court with regards to his future. The Liverpool boss indicated that an offer has already been tabled, telling reporters: ""We cannot do much more, that's how it is. But I don't think it's about that. It's Mo's decision pretty much. The club did what the club can do. That's how it is. ""Nothing bad to say about it. It's fine from my point of view. It's exactly like it should be in this moment in time. Everything is set. Nothing happened further, no signing, no rejection or whatever. ""We just have to wait for that. It's completely fine. No rush in that situation.""

Salah, 29, sees his current deal expire at the end of next season. The Reds would be loathe to lose one of the world's premier strikers, and one moreover who is in the form of his life right now. ""Mo definitely expects this club to be ambitious,"" Klopp explained to reporters on Friday. ""We were in the last few years and we are. ""We cannot do much more, that's how it is. But I don't think it's about that. It's Mo's decision pretty much. The club did what the club can do. That's how it is. ""Nothing bad to say about it. It's fine from my point of view. ""It's exactly like it should be in this moment in time. Everything is set. Nothing happened further, no signing, no rejection or whatever. ""We just have to wait for that. It's completely fine. No rush in that situation."" Klopp's words appeared to elicit a strong reaction from Salah's agent, Ramy Abbas. Shortly after the manager's conference Abbas took to Twitter and, while he did not offer any words in his message, a torrent of laughing faces certainly encouraged the interpretation that he may not have been impressed with what he heard. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ One factor in Salah and his agent's favour is that given his current form, the Egyptian would have no shortage of suitors waiting to pick him up on a free transfer in 2023. The forward has smashed 27 goals in 34 games this season in all competitions for the Reds, who have already lifted the Carabao Cup and remain competitive in the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League.

That prompted the Egyptian football association to file a ""racism"" complaint against their opponents, with the loss meaning that Salah and his team-mates would miss out on the World Cup in Qatar. In the run-up to his penalty, which Salah skied to eventually see Sadio Mane and Senegal advance, the Liverpool star was seen with several lasers being aimed at his face by spectators at the Stade Leopold Sedar Senghor. After a 1-0 first-leg win, Egypt conceded a goal in the fourth minute with the two sides deadlocked all the way through to a penalty shootout. Throughout the match, the partisan home crowd were seen shining lasers onto the field, with those pointers out in full force for the penalty kicks. Dozens of lasers could be seen on Salah's face before he missed from the spot, with Egypt eventually losing 3-1 in the shoot-out to miss out on the World Cup. As the Liverpool forward left the pitch, he was again being targeted as security had to escort him down the tunnel and attempt to protect him from the missiles that were raining down from the stands. Following the match, Egypt manager Carlos Queiroz stepped down, ending his time in charge of the team after taking the role in September. Mohamed Salah will turn 34 during the 2026 World Cup, his next opportunity to play at the tournament.Will this be the final, defining image of the Liverpool superstar's attempts to truly make his mark on the grandest stage of all?#SENEGY #WCQ2022 #LFC #YNWA pic.twitter.com/rpuQqBEoWr While they didn't address the lasers specifically, the Egypt FA have confirmed that they have filed a complaint based on the atmosphere in Senegal. The complaint, posted on their Instagram page, also claimed that racist banners were held up targeting Salah during the contest, while posting pictures of the damage done to their team bus after an attack from fans prior to the game. ‚ÄúThe Egyptian Football Association have lodged a formal complaint against its Senegalese counterpart to the match observer, the security official, CAF, and FIFA, before the start of the match between the two teams,"" the federation said. ‚ÄúThe Egyptian team was subjected to racism after the appearance of offensive banners in the stands aimed at the players, specifically Mohamed Salah. ‚ÄúMoreover, the Senegalese fans terrorised the Egyptian players by throwing bottles and stones at them during the warm-up, as well as attacking the Egyptian team bus, which caused glass shattering and some injuries, which was documented with pictures and videos attached to the complaint.‚Äù Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

47,https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-man-city-premier-league-title-race/ry1uxr1ylhp01rn41zgj6jdmm,Liverpool and Manchester City show why Premier League title race will thrill - but defensive depth is worrying for Reds,"At the end, Pep Guardiola, his team and their fans were the ones celebrating. Maybe that, more than anything else, tells the true story of this brilliant, pulsating Premier League clash. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve seen the champions, now f**k off home,‚Äù crowed the Manchester City supporters, packed tightly into the old Anfield Road end. In front of them, Guardiola gave a smile and a fist pump. He looked happy, focused, determined, themeshe would continue in his post-match press conference. His side could have, should have won perhaps, but the 2-2 draw they chiselled out here will have felt like a victory, given the setting and given the circumstances. ""I am satisfied,"" confirmed Guardiola. For Liverpool, it was a case of what might have been. They remain unbeaten,above City in the table and below only Chelsea;but as they head into the second international break of the campaign, they know their position should be even stronger than it is. They led twice, overcoming a terrible first half to raise the Anfield rooffirst through Sadio Mane and then, spectacularly, through the genius of Mohamed Salah. With nine minutes to go, the game was theirs, but City are champions for a reason, and when Guardiola‚Äôs side needed a response, and a little bit of good fortune, they got it. Kevin De Bruyne‚Äôs deflected leveller at the Kop end ensured the spoils were shared. It was fair, to be perfectly honest. City bossed the first half but Liverpool responded strongly after the break. Both sides had openings, both sides had near misses. Even at 2-2, it needed a remarkable goalline block from Rodri to deny Fabinho a winner. At the other end, Andy Robertson stood firm to prevent Gabriel Jesus from pinching it. That‚Äôs how fine the margins are between these sides, and how fine they will be in this most mouth-watering of title races. In Liverpool, City and Chelsea, we have three heavyweight contenders, and it would be wise not to discount Cristiano Ronaldo and Manchester United as well, even if their recent form suggests they still sit a rung below the others. Liverpool certainly look like they will be in the mix, although this was their third draw of the campaign, and in all three they had looked well-placed to get the win. Just as at Brentford last time out, they let the game slip in the final 10 minutes. Warning signs, perhaps? We are used to such levels of consistency from this team, that anything less than perfect tends to stand out. Certainly the pre-match concerns surrounding the absence of Trent Alexander-Arnold were realised here. James Milner is as good a professional as there is, and a more than competent right-back when needed, but the veteran was given a torrid time by Phil Foden throughout. Foden scored the first and created the second, by which time Milner had been substituted for his own good, having picked up a first-half yellow card and been fortunate to avoid a second after the break. As Milner guiltily walked away after upending Bernardo Silva, Guardiola raged at fourth official Mike Dean on the sideline. Jurgen Klopp, meanwhile, simply told Joe Gomez to get ready. It was a wise call. ""We planned it anyway,"" he said afterwards. Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool hope, will be back for the trip to Watford on October 16, and the Reds need him. Not necessarily for his defensive quality - Foden would have given any full-back a hard time today - but for that quality and range of passing which is so integral to the way Liverpool play. Without him, the Reds looked stodgy and scrambled for 45 minutes. They started OK, but by half-time they were on the ropes, unable to keep the ball and grateful to Alisson Becker for two fine interventions to prevent Foden - who else? - from opening the scoring. Liverpool managed one shot in the first half and it was blocked before it got to within 15 yards of Ederson‚Äôs goal. Jordan Henderson, the captain, misplaced 50 per cent of his passes in midfield. City were sloppy themselves, but dominated. ""We did it exactly how you shouldn't do against City,"" Klopp pointed out. ""We didn't play football."" Whatever hesaid at half time worked, though. Liverpool emerged a different side, hungrier and sharper, with far more threat. Just before the hour mark, Salah slipped two defenders on the right flank and fed Mane, 1-0 to the home side. City still had Foden though, and 10 minutes later he levelled, ghosting in behind Milner to receive Gabriel Jesus‚Äô pass and fire home. Liverpool‚Äôs weak spot punished by City‚Äôs star man. Then Liverpool‚Äôs star man came to the party. Salah received a pass from Curtis Jones on the left corner of the City box, with four defenders for company. He beat them all, his nimble feet taking him into the area. Then he beat Aymeric Laporte to chop the ball onto his right foot. Then he beat Ederson. Anfield exploded. A moment of genius, fit to win any football match. It didn‚Äôt. Foden still had a part to play, this time in space behind Gomez and seeing his low cross reach De Bruyne, whose strike went in off Joel Matip. ‚ÄúJustice,‚Äù tweeted City‚Äôs official account. Rough justice, Liverpool will feel. Matip was, They emerge unscathedthough, and have now faced both of their main rivals and held their own. City, too, will take confidence. They won at Stamford Bridge last week and stood up tall at Anfield this time around. ""The way we lost in Paris showed me we are a good side,"" Guardiola said. ""And so did the way they drew today."" They‚Äôll be up there come May, no doubt.So will Liverpool, though. If this really is to be the tightest title race in years, then this was the ideal game to prove it. More of this, please!

48,https://www.goal.com/en/news/jota-liverpool-quadruple-bid-manchester-city-showdown/bltf8a82df15eff07f6,Jota firing Liverpool's quadruple bid as Reds set up Manchester City showdown,"Mohamed Salah might be their superstar, Sadio Mane their warrior, Roberto Firmino their magician and Luis Diaz their new darling. But where on earth would Liverpool be without Diogo Jota? There are plenty of difference-makers at Anfield these days, but few are as decisive as the Portugal international. They do not call him ‚ÄòJota the Slotter‚Äô for nothing. He's the King of the Penalty Area, as far as Liverpool are concerned. ‚ÄúWhat a player, what a boy!‚Äù boomed Jurgen Klopp on Sunday after Jota‚Äôs goal, his 19th of the season, had edged the Reds past Nottingham Forest and into the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where a mouthwatering Wembley clash with Manchester City awaits. Strap yourselves in, Reds fans, because if February and March have been memorable, then April and May could be absolutely seismic. They don‚Äôt like to talk about it, and understandably so, but the quadruple is alive and kicking. Klopp‚Äôs side are 16 games from immortality. With Jota in this kind of form, they have a chance. There are some players who just have that knack, that ability to be in the right place at the right time, and he is most definitely one. A game-changer, a match-winner. The ùò¥ùò≠ùò™ùò®ùò©ùòµùò¶ùò¥ùòµ of touches from @DiogoJota18.@LFC #EmiratesFACup pic.twitter.com/medNXfWdSI Another was sat in the television studio at the City Ground on Sunday, actually. Jota still has some way to go if he‚Äôs to match Robbie Fowler‚Äôs goalscoring feats at Anfield, but there are certainly similarities between the two, in terms of their movement and instinct around the penalty area. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been brilliant,‚Äù Fowler told ITV Sport. ‚ÄúThere are some strikers who are always dropping deep, which is fine, but he does his work in the box and that makes him a huge threat.‚Äù This is now the most prolific campaign of Jota‚Äôs career, but it is not just the volume of goals which is striking. It is the variety of his strikes, and the significance of them. Twelve times this season, he has scored the Reds‚Äô first goal in a game. The latest came at Forest, where he stretched to touch home Kostas Tsimikas‚Äô inviting left-wing cross, 12 minutes from time. ‚ÄúMassive,‚Äù said Klopp. Jota did not play particularly well, if truth be told, but just as at Arsenal on Wednesday, and just as on so many other occasions before that, it was he who found the code to crack open the safe. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to pass the ball to Diogo, then make sure it‚Äôs in the box!‚Äù joked one member of Liverpool‚Äôs staff. All of Jota's goals this season have come from inside the 18-yard box. He has scored seven with his right foot, seven with his left, and five with his head. In terms of finishing, he has no real weakness. With Diaz on board, Klopp is suddenly able to chop and change his frontline without it damaging his side‚Äôs chances. That could well prove decisive in the coming weeks, as the season reaches a thrilling climax. Before then comes an international break, however. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hate them,‚Äù Klopp said on Sunday, ‚Äúbut they worry me!‚Äù He will spend the next 10 days with his fingers crossed, as his stars head off around the world. Jota is among those in action. Portugal face Turkey in a crunch World Cup qualification play-off in Porto on Thursday. Win that, and they will play either Italy or North Macedonia next Tuesday for a place in Qatar. He is not the only one with big games to play, either. Salah and Mane face off as Egypt take on Senegal, Takumi Minamino is on the brink of qualification with Japan, while Diaz‚Äôs Colombia need a minor miracle as they take on Bolivia and Venezuela. Klopp will hope and pray that all emerge unscathed. He already has concerns over Trent Alexander-Arnold, the defender having missed the Forest game due to a hamstring injury. The feeling is that he could be back to face Benfica in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final on April 5, but it will be touch and go. They handled the England international‚Äôs absence on Sunday, with Joe Gomez filling in admirably. Klopp‚Äôs whole squad will be needed between now and the end of May, that is for sure, with everyone asked to play their part. Jota is certainly playing his. ‚ÄúHe will take us to victory,‚Äù sang the Liverpool fans at Forest. Better get used to that tune. One suspects you will be hearing it quite a lot over the next few weeks. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

He knew how big a goal this was, and he was not about to miss an opportunity to enjoy it. His name had been booed when it was read out before kick off at Estadio da Luz, but he would have the last laugh on the night. The ex-Porto man did what Benfica feared he would; he came back to hit them where it hurts. Diaz‚Äôs late strike sealed a 3-1 win which means Liverpool, surely, have one foot in the semi-finals of the Champions League. It's only the halfway stage of the tie, of course, but on a night when any win would have done, a two-goal triumph represents a huge success for Jurgen Klopp and his side, who will surely finish the job at Anfield next week. That one would have felt good for Luis Diaz! üëäThe former Porto man bags his first #UCL goal for Liverpool to regain their two-goal advantage ‚úåÔ∏èKlopp's smile says it all! pic.twitter.com/VPpaz89Fot Luis Diaz comes back to haunt Benfica, he has never lost to them. üå∂Naby Keita with the run and assist, Liverpool are active! pic.twitter.com/RfAxk4BF8G They were made to work for their advantage here, mind. Having looked at one stage as if they would run away with the tie in the first half, when goals from Ibrahima Konate and Sadio Mane had them firmly in the ascendency, the Reds were given an almighty scare after the break, pegged back by Darwin Nunez‚Äôs goal and hanging on for a spell before steadying the ship in the closing stages. Diaz ensured the night ended on a high, the Colombia international running clear from Naby Keita‚Äôs superbly-weighted pass, three minutes from time, before rounding Odisseas Vlachodimos to finish into an empty net. Inside the stadium, it was as if a pin had been taken to a balloon, all of Benfica‚Äôs hope and belief taken away by the man who used to wear the blue-and-white of their bitter domestic rivals. Diaz rubbed it in, dancing with Fabinho and sticking his tongue out. His third Liverpool goal was his most enjoyable, and the perfect way to mark his first Champions League start for the club. Benfica could not argue too much about the result, in fairness. Liverpool deserved the win, and they deserved at least a two-goal cushion as well. They were breathtaking at times in the opening 45 minutes and had they been a little more clinical, things could have gotten really messy. Were it not for Vlachodimos, the home side would have been battered. Konate got Liverpool off and running, heading in his first goal for the club from an Andy Robertson corner, 16 minutes in. It was a goal of simplicity, and one which made the defender the first Frenchman to score for the Reds in the Champions League since David Ngog, all the way back in 2009. Diaz would play a big part in Liverpool‚Äôs second goal, heading the ball down unselfishly for Sadio Mane to convert from close range. The strike owed everything, though, to the vision and technique of Trent Alexander-Arnold, whose magnificent diagonal pass made it all possible. At that point we were wondering if the tie would be killed there and then. Diaz, cutting in with menace from the left, flashed a shot wide of the near post and was denied by the goalkeeper when clean through, while Mohamed Salah missed a great chance to make it 3-0 right on half time. It was not the Egyptian‚Äôs night, his game a blur of loose touches and misplaced passes, and by the time he was substituted, along with Mane and Thiago Alcantara, the game had started to swing Benfica‚Äôs way. Nunez, their impressive Uruguayan forward, got them back into it, finishing at the far post after Konate had missed his clearance from a Rafa Silva cross from the right. It came from nowhere, a bad error duly punished, and suddenly the tie was in the balance again. Liverpool needed Alisson Becker, their goalkeeper, to bail them out when Everton, Benfica‚Äôs Brazilian wide player, pulled the trigger soon after, and the composure and incision we had saw from the visitors before the break started to evaporate. Alisson had fans‚Äô nerves on edge with a couple of risky plays outside his penalty area, while the noise from the home fans grew as they sensed a famous comeback. It did not arrive. Liverpool regained control thanks to their substitutions, with Roberto Firmino particularly influential. And when Keita grabbed hold of a loose ball and drove forward in the dying stages, he was able to find the right pass for Diaz, who was able to find the right finish. Benfica‚Äôs dismay was Liverpool‚Äôs delight. The semi-finals are well and truly in sight for Klopp‚Äôs men. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

50,https://www.goal.com/en/news/manchester-united-ten-hag-appointment/bltbf22acab9a32e062,Manchester United getting closer to Ten Hag appointment,"Manchester United are moving closer to the appointment of Erik ten Hag as the club‚Äôs next manager. GOAL understands the Dutchman has topped the shortlist of candidates to replace Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on a permanent basis and further talks to work on details of the deal are now being worked out. Club sources insist their recruitment process for hiring the next manager is still ongoing and that no deal has been completed. During the last international break United ramped up their recruitment process in the hope of finalising the next manager before the end of this season. The club wants to have someone in place as soon as possible at the end of the campaign in order to have the final say on transfer targets and be in position before the pre-season tour. Ten Hag and Mauricio Pochettino were the leading two candidates but it is understood the former became the favourite after he impressed in his formal interview two weeks ago. The 52-year-old is yet to finalise a deal but there is increasing hope he will become the next permanent manager once the details are agreed. It is understood that the compensation package of ¬£1.7 million to be paid to Ajax also appealed to Man Utd over the ¬£15m they would have had to pay PSG for Pochettino. United have not ruled out making a formal announcement on their managerial decision before the end of the season but are mindful of being respectful of the other club. Ajax are currently top of the Eredivisie with six games left to play and are four points clear of second place PSV Eindhoven. Sevilla coach Julen Lopetegui and Spain manager Luis Enrqiue were the other two candidates on the club‚Äôs four man shortlist, but the former ruled himself out of contention last month, insisting he is happy at Sevila, while the latter is preparing to take Spain to the World Cup. The club were not keen on hiring another interim manager which pushed Enrique down the pecking order, although it is understood that Carlo Ancelotti was considered an option for that role had the Man Utd hierarchy decided Enrique was worth holding out for. While Thomas Tuchel is admired as an excellent manager, it was never believed that he would be attainable and no approach was made. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

51,https://www.goal.com/en/news/dembele-gavi-latest-barcelona-contract-talks/blt75350e3d665f7b4a,"Dembele, Gavi and the latest situation on Barcelona's contract talks","While Barcelona's 2021-22 campaign has entered its decisive phase, away from the pitch there is also plenty of urgency around Camp Nou. The club is currently seeking to tie down the long-term future of two young stars, Gavi and Ronald Araujo, while there is plenty of doubt over the rejuvenated Ousmane Dembele as the forward's contract runs down. Sergi Roberto is also out of contract at the end of the season, and negotiations continue - albeit at different stages - for all four players while Barca battle for glory in La Liga and the Europa League. Dembele is keen to stay at Barca while the club is equally eager to renew his expiring deal. Nevertheless, a considerable distance remains between the salary the star's agent has demanded and what the Catalans, who are still in less than rude health financially, can offer. In January, Barca looked to offload Dembele to lighten their salary burden and free up transfer funds, but those efforts proved fruitless. The forward ended up staying and is now a key part of Xavi' plans. The coach wants the France international in his squad next year, prompting Barca to restart talks, which will not include any prospect of a salary increase. Araujo, whose deal expires in 2023, is closest to renewing. Barca's initial offer did not convince his agent, who held out for double, or triple the Uruguayan's current wages. Several Premier League clubs also made big offers for his services but were met with a firm no from Araujo in favour of staying at Barca. As the days have gone by the two parties have moved closer together and now a deal is imminent, as agent Edmundo Kabchi explained: ""We are on good terms... Let's hope that in the next few hours or days we will have total agreement. ""There are no major differences, just a few details. The player's priority is to stay."" The exciting young midfielder also wants to stay at Barca, the club which handed him the chance to make his debut  and establish himself as a Liga player at just 17 years of age. In August he will turn 18 and be able to sign his own contracts, a task previously afforded to his parents or legal guardians. The club in turn wants to seal an extension as soon as possible, though Araujo and Dembele are the most pressing cases. There is plenty of time for Gavi, but Barca have been put on alert by the interest shown in the teenager by rival big European clubs. While there is still distance between the club's first offer and the figures demanded by agent Ivan de la Pena, it is not an insurmountable obstacle. Gavi wants to succeed at Camp Nou and Xavi wants him in his team, so there is confidence a deal will be worked out. The long-time utility player's future is the least clear of the quartet. Roberto is out of contract on June 30 and there have been no talks over a possible extension; only a single enquiry last summer with an offer that did not convince the player, and no follow-up on Barca's part. ""They only sent one proposal. We have tried to meet over and over again,"" agent Josep Maria Orobitg fired to Mundo Deportivo in a recent interview. If that impasse is not resolved, Roberto will leave his boyhood club this summer. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

""It was like a boxing fight, an epic bout,"" Klopp told NBC. ""If you put out your arms for a second, then you get a message knock, and that's what happened to both teams. ""I really think we're a step further than we were a year or so ago in possession. That's what we have to do in these games. It's really difficult because they defend really well, but it's possible to give them struggles, and that's what we did. ""I would have liked to do it a little bit more, but the intensity was crazy."" 1 - This game was the first time Manchester City had scored first and not gone on to win in the Premier League this season; they had won all 22 games when scoring first before today. Truce. pic.twitter.com/Jvnua3kyRx Manchester City will ultimately live with the result as it kept them top of the table, but they nonetheless will leave knowing they could have done better at home, having wasted a couple of key opportunities and getting a would-be Raheem Sterling goal ruled out by VAR. ""It was hard,"" said Kevin De Bruyne, the scorer of Manchester City's opener, to Sky Sports. ""To be fair I think we played excellent. The way we played was very good and we should score more. It is what it is. It was a great game. ""I think it should [be more before half-time] but we were still winning. The way the second half started is the disappointment. I think we played great and created enough chances to win the game."" It was a tight match, though, with the expected goals between the sides nearly even. More to come...

Goals for Kevin De Bruyne and Diogo Jota had already put a high-octane match into overdrive, with Alexander-Arnold assisting the latter, while Sadio Mane's second-half strike later rescued a point in a 2-2 draw for the Reds. But the defender was caught short beforehand for City's second, switching off and allowing Jesus to get the run on him for a close-range finish past Alission - and social media was less than impressed with his efforts.

There will be 32 nations looking to chase down global glory in the Middle East, with there plenty of ambitious teams that believe they can emulate the efforts from 2018 of reigning champions France. Only one will prevail, but there promises to be plenty of thrills and spills along the way and you can find everything you need to know about every possible step of that journey right here courtesy of GOAL. History is being made in 2022 as the World Cup finals head to the Middle East for the first time. The event will also be taking place across November and December, rather than its standard June/July slot, due to the soaring summer temperatures in Qatar and will be completed in a condensed 28-day format. An eagerly-anticipated competition will get under way on November 21 and will see action taken in across eight specially-built venues in five cities, with the Lusail Iconic Stadium playing host to the final on December 18.

The 29 nations that had already qualified at that stage were, along with three spots allocated to play-off final winners, placed into four pots based on FIFA‚Äôs international ranking system. There were still three places up for grabs when the finals draw took place, with one of the UEFA section play-offs having to be delayed until June due to Ukraine being unable to take in competitive fixtures following Russia‚Äôs invasion of their borders. Two inter-confederation play-offs are also pencilled in for mid-June, with nations progressing down AFC, CONMEBOL, CONCACAF and OFC sections involved in those contests.

Al Rihla translates to 'the journey' in Arabic, with the ball design drawing inspiration from Qatar's unique architecture, ""iconic"" boats and national flag. The Al Rihla is said to move quicker in the air than any of the previous World Cup balls and reportedly provides ""the highest level of accuracy and reliability on the field of play"". The 20 panels of the ball are included to help enhance aerodynamics, helping players improve the accuracy and swerve of their shots, while the product is made entirely from water-based inks and glues ‚Äì a first for a World Cup model. Franziska Loeffelmann, design director in the football graphics and hardwear department at Adidas, has offered a summary of the key features. She said: ‚ÄúThe game is getting faster, and as it speeds up, accuracy and flight stability becomes critically important. The new design allows the ball to maintain its speed significantly higher as it journeys through the air.‚Äù Tickets for World Cup 2022 first went on sale at fifa.com/tickets on January 22. The first phase of sales ran until March 29 and consisted of random sales selection draw and first come, first served periods. A second phase was opened after the finals draw on April 1 and operates in a similar fashion to the initial process. The third and final phase of tickets sales is the 'last-minute' one, which is purely run on a first come, first served basis and will extend through to the end of the tournament. All supporters planning on attending games at the World Cup finals are reminded by FIFA that ‚Äúat the request of the Qatari authorities, all local and international fans must apply for a Hayya Card. Hayya Card is your entry permit to the State of Qatar and your stadium access (along with the match ticket). International fans will also need to confirm their accommodation plans.‚Äù Individual tickets are split up into four categories and the prices for each category - converted to British pounds from U.S. dollars - are shown below. Tickets from category four are only available to residents of Qatar. Match Cat 1 Cat 2 Cat 3 Cat 4 Opening match ¬£472 ¬£336 ¬£231 ¬£42 Group matches ¬£168 ¬£126 ¬£53 ¬£8 Round of 16 ¬£210 ¬£157 ¬£73 ¬£15 Quarter-finals ¬£325 ¬£220 ¬£157 ¬£63 Semi-finals ¬£730 ¬£503 ¬£273 ¬£105 Third place play-off ¬£325 ¬£231 ¬£157 ¬£63 Final ¬£1,227 ¬£766 ¬£461 ¬£157 As is always the case with World Cup finals, coverage in the UK will be split between the BBC and ITV. They struck another two-tournament deal with FIFA ahead of the 2018 event that covers television, radio and online coverage. Agreements put in place across the globe are reported to have netted world football‚Äôs governing body around $1.85bn ($1.41bn). In the United States, World Cup 2022 will be broadcast by Fox in English and Telemundo in Spanish. They wrestled rights away from ESPN and Univision ahead of the 2018 tournament and have a deal in place through to the end of the 2026 finals ‚Äì which will be staged across America, Canada and Mexico. Who is going to win the World Cup? üèÜ pic.twitter.com/FgZdaz7YpG Brazil, who have reclaimed the number one spot on FIFA‚Äôs ranking chart, are the favourites at bet365 to savour World Cup glory in Qatar. The Selecao are five-time winners of the competition, but their last success came 20 years ago in Japan and South Korea. Defending champions France, with the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Paul Pogba at their disposal, are also highly fancied and push Brazil close at the top of a congested betting market. England, who reached the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and final of Euro 2020, have pieced together an exciting young squad that will believe they can bring 56 years of hurt to a close in 2022. Spain and Germany complete the top five of leading contenders for global glory, with Argentina ‚Äì who are looking to land Lionel Messi his first crown ‚Äì sitting just outside of that pack. Belgium‚Äôs so-called golden generation have failed to deliver tangible success when at the peak of their powers, and have work to do in order to earn favour with punters, while Portugal will feel that anything is possible with Cristiano Ronaldo in their ranks. The Netherlands are another dark horse that could go well if early momentum is established, but little is expected from the USMNT and Mexico as they are given triple-figure prices before a ball is kicked in anger. Unsurprisingly, seven-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner Messi is a market leader when it comes to top scorer honours at World Cup 2022. The mercurial Argentine has endured a testing 2021-22 campaign after leaving Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain as a free agent, but remains a talisman for his country and still has plenty of magic left up his sleeve. Neymar and Antoine Griezmann, of Brazil and France respectively, are also being tipped to fill their boots when leading the line for two nations taking aim at the ultimate prize. England captain Harry Kane is looking to land back-to-back Golden Boots and tends to save his best for the big occasion, while Ronaldo can never be ruled out of any competition relating to acts of goal-scoring brilliance. In the Golden Ball stakes, 2014 winner Messi figures prominently once again. Neymar is also in that mix, as the man expected to lead Brazil‚Äôs charge, while Mbappe has been showing at PSG that he could be the next superstar to set world football alight. A number of singles will be released from the official FIFA World Cup 2022 Soundtrack. The first of those was revealed on April 1, with Hayya Hayya (Better Together) made available across multiple platforms. FIFA has said ‚Äúthe uplifting track, featuring Trinidad Cardona, Davido and Aisha, draws on R&B and reggae influences‚Äù as the organisation seeks to ‚Äúconnect with audiences worldwide through the shared passions of football and music‚Äù.

Another opportunity to land major silverware has passed the Red Devils by, with Roberto Martinez‚Äôs side only able to muster a fourth-place finish at the UEFA Nations League finals. They remain the No 1 side on the planet in the official rankings, but De Bruyne claims Belgium lack the depth required to secure tangible success. The Manchester City midfielder told HLNafter suffering a 2-1 defeat to Italy in the Nations League play-off: ‚ÄúWe did well at times against some top teams and had many new faces who did more than a decent job today. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good experience for them to be able to play against opponents of this calibre, but unfortunately we lost twice. With all due respect, playing against Estonia is not the same thing and these challenges are necessary for us to grow, both as individuals and as a team. He added: ‚ÄúWith all due respect, we are ‚Äòjust‚Äô Belgium. It‚Äôs a new generation, we were missing Romelu Lukaku and Eden Hazard today, so we have to be realistic about the team we have. Italy, France and Spain have 22 top players to choose from and we do not.‚Äù  Belgium have entered every major tournament since 2014 among the favourites,given they can all upon the talents of De Bruyne, Lukaku, Hazard, Thibaut Courtois, Axel Witsel and Dries Mertens. They havehoweverprogressed beyond the quarter-final stage just once at the last four competitions, with a third-place finish at the 2018 World Cup.

This time around, the playmaker's goal was scored in the same stadium in which he collapsed last summer, with his effort coming against Serbia. Eriksen was handed the captain's armband as he made an emotional return, with many of those present giving him a standing ovation.

Denmark's clash with Serbia is one of their March friendlies as they look to build some momentum before some competitive football. The stadium they played in is the same one in which Eriksen suffered a shock cardiac arrest last summer and it was his first time back. The former Tottenham man had to have a defibrillator fitted and left Inter for Brentford to get his career back on track. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Chelsea won the Champions League last season, beating Real Madrid in the semi-finals before conquering Manchester City in an all-English showpiece, but are in danger of exiting at the quarter-final stage this time around. Madrid exacted revenge in the first leg of their last eight tie on Wednesday, winning 3-1 at Stamford Bridge thanks to a Karim Benzema hat-trick, and Chelsea could be without two key players when they try to turn the contest around at Santiago Bernabeu. Tuchel revealed that Lukaku is dealing with an injury ahead of Chelsea's trip to Southampton in the Premier League on Sunday. The Belgian striker may be forced to sit out the Blues' next meeting with Madrid on Tuesday along with Azpilicueta, who has tested positive for coronavirus. ""He's injured [Lukaku]. Azpilicueta unfortunately has a positive Covid test,""Tuchel told Premier League Productions. Chelsea spent ¬£98 million ($128m) to bring Lukaku back to the club from Inter last summer, but he has since been unable to live up to that club record price tag. The 28-year-old has only managed to score 12 goals in 36 appearances this season, including just five in the Premier League, and has been in and out of Tuchel's starting XI. Lukaku has also been held back by a string of fitness issues, missing a total of nine games after his latest knock, and now looks set to sit out arguably Chelsea's biggest fuxture of the campaign.

There will also be a potential reunion for Eden Hazard and Chelsea, as he prepares to welcome his former side in the first leg before travelling to Stamford Bridge a week later. Goalhas what you need to know if Hazard has been deemed fit to feature against his old team. The Belgian has been included in the Champions League squad to face Chelsea on Tuesday evening, and has been declared fitby Zidane. Hazard had been sidelined with a hip injury since March 13, but was able to make a 15-minute cameo in the 0-0 draw to Real Betis on Saturday. Whether or not he will actually feature in the game is a different question, based on the injuries and fitness levelshe has struggled with this season. Should Hazard be selected to play in the game, it will be the first time he has come up against his former club since his‚Ç¨100 million (¬£88m/$112m) move in 2019. Zidane gave Hazard the all-clear to be named in the team, and outlined the forward's importance to the squad. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see Eden having any doubts. He looked very good on the field the other day,"" Zidane told reporters at a press conference on Monday. ‚ÄúThat was the most important, not feeling anything from his old problems. Now he is good, and now to push on. ‚ÄúWe are happy to have him with us, he will bring a lot to the team.‚Äù Hazard has had plenty of injury woes this season, making just 15 appearances for Los Blancos in all competitions so far. The former Chelsea man had been diagnosed with an injury in the ""right psoas muscle"" after he was taken off against Elche last month, but did not undergo an operation astwo doctors who previously worked on his right ankle strongly advised against doing so. Real Madrid had been hoping for Hazard to return to fitness in time to face Liverpool, and thenGetafe on April 18, but was only given the green light to play against Real Betis on April 24. Toni Kroos is also aiming for a return to the team after being sidelined since the Champions League second leg quarter-final tie against Liverpool. Ferland Mendy, meanwhile, is a doubt due to an ongoingcalf issue. Zidane said: ""Toni will be available, Ferland won't."" Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

62,https://www.goal.com/en/news/foden-magic-touch-man-city-break-simeone-atletico-wall/blt50ad20b41710491e,Foden finds the magic touch for Man City to break down Simeone's Atletico wall,"Match statistics: Manchester City 1-0 Atletico Madrid According to quantum theory, there is an astronomically small probability that a ball will eventually pass through a brick wall if it is attempted an infinite number of times. And for 70 minutes on Tuesday, Manchester City appeared to be running the experiment live in their Champions League first leg with Atletico Madrid. Diego Simeone brought a new extreme version of 'anti-football' to the Etihad Stadium and for over three-quarters of the match it worked. Enter Phil Foden. Just 79 seconds after stepping off the bench, the England international found the tiniest pocket of space on the edge of the box, turned quickly and then played an instinctive nutmeg pass into Kevin De Bruyne's path to slide the ball past Jan Oblak. All Man City needed was Phil Foden on the pitch üòÖ80 seconds after coming on he unlocks the Atletico defence to set up Kevin De Bruyne!Big goal in this tie...#UCL pic.twitter.com/rRIXIah2EI Clinical from Kevin De Bruyne on his 50th #UCL appearance. üéØThe ball from Phil Foden, though. ü•∂ pic.twitter.com/647s2zqN4U It felt like City had needed absolute precision to find a way through Atletico's packed defence and it was the homegrown star that delivered it. Quite why the 22-year-old had not started was a mystery before the match, and even more so after he caused the Spanish champions more problems in his 20-minute cameo on the pitch than any other City player. It was not quite overthinking from Pep Guardiola to leave Foden out, but it was a decision that potentially made his team's night more difficult. Foden's livewrire movement stretched Atletico's disciplined defence, and he created City's best opportunity from open play of the night when he tricked his way to the touch line and pulled a ball back for De Bruyne, who could not find a way past the four defenders in the six-yard box as he aimed to secure some breathing space ahead of the second leg. A second goal never came, however, and it is difficult to see who the 1-0 scoreline suits better. City have an advantage to take to Madrid and will hope that Atletico will eventually come out to play and leave some room to attack. But Simeone has a platform to approach the game in the same defensive manner for the majority of the second leg and hope to make the most of any opportunities on the counterattack or from set-pieces. The tempo was set in the opening 15 minutes, when City had 92 per cent possession of the ball. And it felt like a good chunk of Atletico's eight per cent was spent waiting for Jan Oblak to take a goal kick. They eventually reached a surprising 29% of possession by full-time, but this was the ultimate show in defensive football. When Antoine Griezmann broke quickly with just one defender alongside him early in the second half, he was still 70 yards from goal with no support, and eventually kicked the ball out for a throw-in when trying to find a team-mate as he ran out of energy. He and fellow forward Joao Felix spent almost as much time defending in their own box as they did in City's half. It produced a heat map that if it were illustrating a person's health would suggest hypothermia from the neck down. It may not have been entertaining, but it was largely effective. City tried to stretch their opponents, but even with Riyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling staying close to their respective touchlines, their time and space was quickly shut down by the breathless Renan Lodi and Sime Vrsaljko. When they went through the middle, there was simply no room for Bernardo Silva or De Bruyne to create any magic. And when they were eventually forced to throw long balls into the box, Stefan Savic, Felipe and Reinildo headed and volleyed it clear from danger. It took a moment of magic from Foden and De Bruyne's fifth goal in as many games to find a way through. After what was the first of four massive games against Atletico and Liverpool in the space of 12 days, it is advantage City in the Champions League - but only just.

63,https://www.goal.com/en/news/de-bruyne-thiago-alcantara-man-city-liverpool-potential/blta5dbfe3950b4a4bf,De Bruyne vs Thiago Alcantara: Man City and Liverpool's potential title-deciders,"It is not hyperbolic to suggest this might be the biggest match in Premier League history. Rarely do we get genuine to-the-wire title battles, let alone head-to-heads that seem almost certain to decide which team will lift the trophy. The emerging rivalry between Manchester City and Liverpool is certainly the most high-quality English football has ever seen, and the two manager's contrasting styles have given us some of the sport's greatest moments over the last five years. But for all the talk of Liverpool and Manchester City being an evenly-balanced rivalry, Pep Guardiola has increasingly taken control of this fixture. Jurgen Klopp will be acutely aware that his side have won just one of their last eight meetings and that the matches themselves are becoming more one-sided over time. Earlier this season at Anfield, Mohamed Salah's genius dragged Liverpool into the game and earned them a 2-2 draw, but for long periods ‚Äì particularly in the first half ‚Äì Man City were dominant. They should have put the game to bed in the opening 30 minutes, picking up from where they left off in the game before, a thumping 4-1 win at the Etihad. It has been a long time since Klopp's furious pressing and cutting attacking transitions caused Guardiola serious problems; a long time since City would concede three or four in short blitzes. It might have slipped under the radar but Guardiola has found a way to tame Liverpool, deploying a cautious back three (Kyle Walker stays deep) to control against the counters as well as provide wide passing options to circumnavigate Liverpool's narrow forwards. But Klopp has an ace up his sleeve, a way to control this fixture a little more. It is no coincidence that Man City's late flurry of goals in their 4-1 win last season came after Thiago Alcantara was substituted. The Spaniard was taken off in the 68th minute with the score at 1-1. Liverpool essentially fell apart without him. Thiago missed the 2-2 draw altogether and, in his absence, Liverpool couldn't evade the City press and build their way up the pitch. Man City penned them in, before targeting right-back James Milner by instructing false nine Jack Grealish to double up on the left with Phil Foden. That should not happen this time, not with Thiago on the pitch for the full 90. His press-resistance in central midfield and unique capacity to break the lines even when surrounded by on-rushing opponents makes him arguably Klopp's most important player. Thiago takes total control of games, ensuring Liverpool retain a territorial advantage and play with verticality and urgency, wriggling clear of the press to set his team-mates away. And the stats would back that up. Liverpool have won all 12 Premier League matches this season in which Thiago has started. He makes 11.12 progressive passes per 90, the most among Premier League midfielders, and 14.5 passes under pressure per 90, second behind Rodri. He is undoubtedly the key to Klopp redressing the balance, preventing Man City from swarming, and giving Liverpool a foothold in the game. And intriguingly, his direct opponent on that left side of central midfield happens to Man City's most important player: Kevin De Bruyne. The Belgian will occupy the same half-space as Thiago, and considering the likelihood that the Liverpool midfielder will help his team weave away from pressure to counter ‚Äì creating an end-to-end game ‚Äì their tussle for space will travel the length of the pitch and back again. The sight of De Bruyne steaming into open grass is rare, but not against Liverpool; Guardiola allows his team to play more directly than usual in this fixture. Thiago's capacity to track De Bruyne as he does so will be crucial, although perhaps of more relevance is how the Liverpool midfielder deals with De Bruyne's unusual movement out to the right. Few No.8s in world football play quite so far out to one side. De Bruyne often takes up the position of a traditional right-winger, crossing and assisting from the pocket of space around the corner of the penalty area. This is of particular significance to Liverpool because their narrow 4-3-3 demands a lot of the two central midfielders either side of Fabinho. Thiago's work getting out to meet De Bruyne when he peels wide could prove decisive, especially considering Andrew Robertson will have his hands full with Riyad Mahrez. Thiago versus De Bruyne aside, it is difficult to predict where this game will be won or lost because so much will rest on in-game changes. In a frantic contest, Klopp and Guardiola will react and counter-react to one another, as they always do. It is worth noting that the 4-1 wasn't just about Thiago leaving the pitch. It was also the result of Guardiola switching to a 4-4-2 with two false nines, puzzling the Liverpool players. We should prepare ourselves for more surprises on Sunday. But whatever the outcome, and however the action unfolds at the Etihad, more than likely one of Thiago or De Bruyne will have been the catalyst; the match and title-winner for their side.

City are currently on course to retain the Premier League title as they sit top of the table with 73 points from 30 matches, one more than second-placed Liverpool. Jurgen Klopp's side can leapfrog the champions with a win in Manchester, though, and Guardiola is very much aware of the unique threat they will pose. ""In the beginning of the season and then two or three months ago, I said, 'what date is Liverpool? When do we play against them?',"" The City boss has told Sky Sports. ""Of course everything is different because we know it's seven games left and we are only one point ahead. ""Winning will not be enough, but it will be an important step. And we know‚Ä¶ 'wow, this is the game'. You know it, we know it. So I'm not going to deny it's different to any other game. And the preparations are a bit different, you know, especially because they do something that no other team in all around the world do - the movement they have. ""The threats that they have in front - they had an incredible three players (Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino) and now an incredible five with Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota. Plus Divock Origi who always scores when they need to make decisive goals."" Guardiola went on to insist that whatever the final result may be, he will still head home to put his feet up and catch the last round of The Masters - one of the standout golfing events on the calendar. ""We don't have a proper striker, but it is what it is. We still score a lot of goals in our way, we still concede few, so we're going to continue to do it,"" he added. ""We have to work on what we need to do, to talk about it and prepare for it. But at the end, I still sleep, wake up in the morning, have breakfast, lunch, dinner‚Ä¶ ""So I prepare the training session, then I'm going to rest a little and be completely relaxed in front of the TV, watching Tiger Woods and Tommy Fleetwood."" Guardiola has already delivered three Premier League titles among a whole host of other domestic honours at the Etihad Stadium, but hasn't won the Champions League since 2011, when he was still at Barca. The 51-year-old lifted two European Cups and three La Liga crowns during his four year stint in charge at Camp Nou before moving onto Bayern and eventually City, and it has been suggested that he hit his peak as a coach with the Blaugrana. Guardiola has rejected that notion, however, insisting that the experience he has built up over the last eight years has helped him hone his craft. ""When I was in my early years in Barcelona, I was more anxious about everything, more sensitive for everything,"" he said. ""Now I handle situations a little bit more calmer. ""I've learnt a lot at City. I'm a completely different manager and I feel I'm a better manager than when I started out because of the experiences. ""You can't have the same ideas of 12 or 13 years ago, you become lazy, and you are not scared. You don't have the intuition or the desire to think 'oh, maybe we do it like that' even though maybe it will be a mistake. ""Life is about experiences and learning to improve different things.""

65,https://www.goal.com/en/news/st-totteringhams-day-has-come-to-an-end-and-wengers-arsenal/1be1qeklbo3il16ntadqygi2bi,St. Totteringham's Day has come to an end and Wenger's Arsenal contract should too,"How apt that after all the talk of power shifts, Tottenham comprehensively defeated arch-rivals Arsenal in Arsene Wenger‚Äôs 50th north London derby to confirm that the tide has officially turned in the battle for supremacy between these two great rivals. Alli & Kane fire Spurs past Arsenal Mauricio Pochettino‚Äôs men fully deserved the three points and would have scored more than two unanswered goals were it not for the excellent goalkeeping of Petr Cech, who made nine saves during the match. By comparison, Hugo Lloris was called upon just four times. The main accusation made against Wenger this season is that his team have capitulated in the games against top six sides. The 3-1 losses to Chelsea and Arsenal, as well as the 2-1 defeat to Manchester City, were all results that reinforced the notion that Arsenal can no longer challenge the big boys. The table now proves it too. Even more gallingly for Gunners fans, the standings also now show that Spurs are a far superior side. They are fifth, a whopping 17 points behind Tottenham. For the first time since Wenger arrived in north London in 1996, Arsenal will finish below their second-placed north London neighbours.      ""Well done to them,"" Wenger magnanimously stated afterwards, ""but when you start the championship the target is not to finish above Spurs; it is to fight for the title. In 20 years, it happened once. Mathematically, it has to happen once. ""We are not happy with it but we don't compare ourselves to Spurs. We compare ourselves to where we want to be."" The sad truth of the matter, though, is that Tottenham are now exactly where Arsenal used to be: fighting for the title playing a thrilling brand of attacking football. Spurs end 22-year derby curse This fixture always threatened to illustrate the stark contrast in effectiveness and enthusiasm between these two sides - and their respective supporters, for that matter - and it did just that. During a frenzied opening, both Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen missed glorious opportunities to give the home side what would have been a deserved lead in the final north London derby at White Hart Lane. However, Spurs fans need not have worried about their side shooting themselves in the foot in familiar fashion. They are now better than that and got the goal their vigorous display merited when Alli bundled the ball home after Cech had denied the excellent Eriksen.     Arsenal then did what they have done so often this season and completely switched off, with Harry Kane doubling Tottenham's advantage just 146 seconds later from the penalty spot, effectively ending Arsenal's hopes of a top-four finish in the process. Indeed, with tricky games against Manchester United, Stoke and Everton still to come, Arsenal will do well to finish fifth. Spurs close in on record run Of courseWenger will still be dreaming of finishing the season on a high but, while an FA Cup victory is still a possibility, it‚Äôs worth remembering that Chelsea, the likely Premier League champions, await the Gunners at Wembley next month. Furthermore, even a trophy would do little to convince an already hostile group of fans that Wenger is the right man to get Arsenal back on the same level as Tottenham, let alone Chelsea. St. Totteringham's Day has already been cancelled. Wenger's new contract offer should be too. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side smashed the record for the most points in a single campaign in the Premier League erawith100 points in 2017-18, and Manchester United have also won the title with more than the 90 the Gunners collected on their unbeaten run. But neither of those great teams can say they have ever gone an entire season without losing a league game. So just howdid Arsenal do it? Goal have put together a complete guide to one of the most famous sides in English football history. The Invincibles is the name given to the Arsenal team which won the 2003-04 Premier League. The reason for the nickname is that they went unbeaten in their 38 league matches. They won 26 games and drew 12. Arsenal usually lined up in a 4-4-2 formation, though it could also be labelled a 4-2-3-1 due to the way Dennis Bergkamp dropped into the 'No.10' position between midfield and attack. The team is mostly remembered for its attacking genius. Thierry Henry was at the peak of his powers and finished second in the Ballon d'Or voting in 2003 and fourth in 2004, and while Bergkamp was nearing the end of his career he had not lost his brilliant movement or vision. Left winger Robert Pires provided a secondary source of goals, netting 14 in the league, while Patrick Vieira was both the heart and brain of the team from central midfield. On the right, Freddie Ljungberg was a ferocious box-to-box player who raised his game for the big occasion.  What is not mentioned as often- particularly when comparing the Invincibles to today's Arsenal team - was that the Gunners were also outstanding defensively, conceding just 26 goals. Sol Campbell and Kolo Toure were a brilliant mix of athleticism and intelligence at centre-back, Jens Lehmann brought international class in goal and Ashley Cole and Lauren were a dynamic full-back pairing. It was not just the quality of the personnel, however, but also the way they set up. Arsenal were more like Atletico Madrid than Barcelona, with both Gilberto Silva and Vieira tasked with shielding the defence and Cole and Lauren not allowing their desire to attack and overlap compromise their duties in their own half. Pires and Ljungberg did not hang around high up the field but were expected to track back and turn the ball over. That commitment to defending made Arsenal an even better team going forward than their talent alone would suggest, because they were able to absorb pressure in their own half before launching lethal counter-attacks led by Henry.   Arsene Wenger was the manager of Arsenal during their 'Invincibles' season in 2003-04. After the victory over Leicester City that completed Arsenal's unbeaten season, the Guardian writer Kevin Mitchell labelled Wenger the most astute manager in the Premier League, and ""probably all of football at the moment"". Wenger had not only revolutionised Arsenal but the entire division, introducing new training, fitness and dieting regimes that forced managers across the country to follow suit and demand greater professionalism and discipline from their players. Gone were the days of victories being celebrated with fatty food and several pints of beer.   The Frenchman's record of identifying players no one had heard of and moulding them into full internationals was also unmatched at that time. Toure was signed for ¬£150,000 from an Ivorian club and converted from midfield and full-back into a central defender, while Ljungberg cost ¬£3 million from Halmstads in Sweden. Perhaps the most flattering compliment you can pay Wenger is that he was Sir Alex Ferguson's first true equal. His star fell since then and he bowed out on a low in 2018 leaving Arsenal in sixth place, but in his first decade in north London he was a brilliant combination of tactical nous and ruthlessness, assembling teams that played scintillating football and were not intimidated by anyone.   Thierry Henry can lay legitimate claim to being the greatest player of the Premier League era. He is not the only star in the conversation and some may argue that Alan Shearer and Ryan Giggs did it for longer, but only Cristiano Ronaldo has hit the heights of Arsenal's No.14 at his peak. The Frenchman has been voted the Gunners' greatest ever, anyway, and netted a career-best 30 league goals during the unbeaten campaign. Quite simply, everything Henry did was fast; whether it be running, shooting or passing, it was as if he could do and see things twice as quickly as everyone else around him. As was the case with about half of Arsenal's starting XI, Henry arrived at Arsenal with a much lesser profile than that which he left them with and had struggled on the left wing during a solitary season at Juventus. Wenger, who had coached him previously at Monaco, paid ¬£11m to cut his stay in Italy short and made him a centre forward. His partnership with Bergkamp was the perfect blend of speed, skill and intelligence. With the Dutchman's tendency to drop into the hole and Henry's fondness of pulling out on to the left flank, they were brilliant at finding space and left opposition centre-backs wondering whether to follow them and be dragged around the pitch or leave them unattended. *Includes all players to make at least one Premier League appearance.

What everyone loves more than a tight title race is a close tussle between two clubs in which the sides involved face off in the run-in. While City‚Äôs clash with the Reds on Sunday is not a final-day encounter, most neutrals will reckon the gameweek 31 clash between teams seperated by one point is preferable to the 2018/19 season when the second meeting between both clubs was held in January 2019. Pep Guardiola‚Äôs troops claimed a 2-1 success, a game perhaps remembered for John Stones‚Äô goal-line clearance, but what followed was a run-in where there was little drama. For the neutral, an encounter between both clubs so late in the season is just what the doctor ordered, but are supporters expecting too much from Sunday evening owing to the relative one-sidedness of this particular fixture? Regardless of Liverpool‚Äôs transformation into of Europe‚Äôs top sides and undoubtedly a relentless winning machine under Jurgen Klopp, wins at the Etihad Stadium have been few and far between. This is despite the acquisitions of Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah, who joined the Reds in 2016 and 2017 respectively and have been tremendously good for the Reds in the last half-decade or thereabouts. Neither were at the club in November 2015 when the Merseyside outfit thrashed Manuel Pellegrini‚Äôs Citizens 4-1, with goals from Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and Martin Skrtel following an Eliaquim Mangala own goal. The following six games have witnessed only four goals from Liverpool, with the last five involving Mane and Salah seeing the Reds score three just three times at the Etihad. With only one goal between them in those games, GOAL takes a closer look at the African marksmen‚Äôs performances over the last four Premier League clashes in Manchester. The Reds went into the gameweek four fixture having claimed seven points from an available nine, with eight goals scored and only three conceded. Mane had netted three times‚Äîone each against Watford, Crystal Palace and Arsenal‚Äîwhereas Salah‚Äôs two goals and a sole assist meant the pair were backed to surprise the title favourites on home turf. Despite falling behind to a Sergio Aguero goal, the Reds posed an attacking threat‚Ä¶until their Senegal attacker received a red card for a dangerous play involving Ederson in the 37th minute. They fell apart afterwards and Pep‚Äôs team netted four more times to thrash the Merseyside outfit 5-0. Salah was replaced at half-time with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain replacing the Egypt superstar. What might have been had Mane‚Äôs dismissal never happened? 2019 started with a top of the table clash involving these giants who tussled on January 3, with the Reds travelling to Manchester holding a seven-point lead over Pep‚Äôs side. They fell to a 2-1 loss which saw the Cityzens reduce the gap to four points, but the outcome could have been different had Mane scored his one-v-one with Ederson in the 18th minute having been played through by Salah. The ex-Southampton man hit the post and the resulting confusion led to John Stones‚Äô goal-line clearance with Liverpool‚Äôs Egyptian also ready to pounce. Sergio Aguero and Leroy Sane scored either side of a Roberto Firmino equaliser to seal an important victory for Pep‚Äôs men who went on to claim the title by one point at season‚Äôs end. Liverpool had been crowned champions by the time they travelled to the Etihad in July 2020 and received a guard of honour from the deposed champions before kick-off. Guardiola‚Äôs troops thrashed Klopp‚Äôs men 4-0 but, yet again, the game could have gone a different way had Mane not badly misdirected a Trent Alexander-Arnold cross off target after 11 minutes or had Salah not hit the post eight minutes later. Kevin De Bruyne opened the scoring from the spot and the home side did not look back, netting three more times from Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden and a Chamberlain own-goal to seal another heavy Liverpool defeat at the Etihad. Last season‚Äôs meeting in Manchester was a rather humdrum affair where both sides seemed unwilling to give too much away. It ended 1-1, although the non-penalty Expected Goals of 0.8-0.6 validates how few quality chances were created by both sides at the Etihad. Salah netted his first league goal against the Citizens away from home when he beat Ederson from 12 yards to open the scoring for Klopp‚Äôs men after 13 minutes. This was wiped out by Gabriel Jesus‚Äô leveller at the half-hour mark and it stayed that way till full-time, despite the Belgium superstar missing the target from a penalty just before the interlude. While Mane did not score or assist, he had one of his better games at City, completing three dribbles from as many attempts and also won the early penalty that was dispatched by Salah. Try as they might, Liverpool have been unable to crack it at the Etihad since 2015, although a 2-1 Champions League success in April 2018 ‚Äî in which Salah scored ‚Äî offers hope for Sunday. Having said that, it has mostly been let down after let-down against Guardiola‚Äôs men who have to be considered slight favourites regardless of the Reds‚Äô ongoing momentum. ‚ÄúMane's Etihad history, generally, is one of disappointment,‚Äù GOAL‚Äôs Liverpool correspondent Neil Jones admits. ‚ÄúA red card in a 5-0 defeat in September 2017 and that incredible moment in January 2019 when he hit the post when clean through, with John Stones somehow scrambling the subsequent loose ball off the line. ‚ÄúHe is yet to score on the ground, despite a good record against City at Anfield. Maybe Sunday is the day to change that?‚Äù As for Salah, Jones fondly remembers how the Reds forward silenced the City supporters who hoped for a turnaround after a 3-0 hammering at Anfield. ‚ÄúSalah has scored goals there, none bigger than his beautifully-clipped finish in the Champions League in 2019,‚Äù he states. ‚ÄúIt is hard to forget the silence from the home fans, swiftly followed by the explosion from the away end. He netted a penalty in last season's 1-1 draw too, though, like Mane, his record is naturally better on home soil.‚Äù Despite three defeats on that ground since their last win, an argument can be made that there was little jeopardy in the subsequent meetings except that 2-1 loss in January 2019. Having said that, Klopp‚Äôs men cannot afford another setback at the home of their adversaries and the German boss will need Salah and Mane to show something different to reverse the trend of the last few years at City. May the better team win. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The German Football Association (DFB) has ruled that while there was a brief mix-up late on during a double substitution from the reigning champions, the final result of the contest will still stand. Bayern briefly had an extra man on the pitch when making changes in the 86th minute against Freiburg, with Kingsley Coman failing to make his way to the touchline before tactical tweaks were completed. Freiburg lodged an official complaint to the DFB, claiming that they had grounds for appeal as an ineligible player had become involved. Their efforts to get the game replayed or the result made null and void have been thrown out, with the match officials considered to have been the ones in the wrong, not Bayern. Stephan Oberholz, chairman of the DFB sports court, said: ‚ÄúFirst of all, we assume that all FC Bayern players were eligible to play. ‚ÄúRegardless of this, the at best slight contribution to misconduct by Bayern, which is secondary to that of the referees, is also insufficient from a point of view of proportionality to justify the serious legal consequences of a game revaluation.‚Äù He added on the role played in the confusion by appointed match officials: ‚ÄúThey didn't fulfil their obligation to check the number of players. ‚ÄúIn the end, the referee continued the match without checking the permitted number of players again.‚Äù With it confirmed that the result against Freiburg will stand, Bayern retain their nine-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga table. They have just six games left to take in this season and have opened up a commanding advantage over second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Another title triumph would appear to be on the cards at the Allianz Arena, with Julian Nagelsmann looking to guide his side to a 10th successive crown. Bayern are also in the hunt for Champions League honours this season, although they have work to do in a quarter-final clash with Villarreal in that competition after suffering a shock 1-0 first leg defeat.

The prolific Polish striker has plundered 339 goals through 368 appearances for the reigning German champions, with tallies of 40 or more registered in each of the last seven seasons. He is showing no sign of slowing down, but is also 33 years of age and Hamann is not convinced that extending his deal at the Allianz Arena through to 2025 would be the best option for all concerned ‚Äì with even all-time greats seeing their powers wane once they pass their mid-30s. Former Bayern midfielder Hamann told GOAL and SPOX of extension talk in Bavaria: ‚ÄúThere is no reason not to extend with [Manuel] Neuer or [Thomas] Muller. ‚ÄúWith Lewandowski you have to see whether he wants more than two years. Then of course you have to think about it. At the end of the contract he would be nearly 37. You can see with Ronaldo that it gets more difficult with age.‚Äù The ex-Germany international added: ‚ÄúWith Muller and Neuer I say, yes, extend them. But of course they can't earn more. You have to make sure that the contracts are made even more performance-related. ‚ÄúIf you have five to six players who earn 20 million euros, you have to claim that you get to the semi-finals in the Champions League. Of course you can be eliminated, but it's always about the process.‚Äù If Robert Lewandowski leaves Bayern, where should he go? üßê pic.twitter.com/L5dRvXQ4jw Bayern are sweating on a place in the last four of the Champions League this season after suffering a 1-0 defeat to Villarreal in the first leg of their quarter-final showdown. They have also made uncomfortable headlines for briefly having 12 men on the field during a 4-1 Bundesliga win over Freiburg ‚Äì who have appealed against the outcome of that contest ‚Äì and Hamann believes a lack of leadership on and off the field is undermining efforts in Munich. He said of the substitution shambles against Freiburg: ‚ÄúNone of the Bavarians have admitted their guilt. They held up the board with the wrong number. ‚ÄúI don't know what [Marcel] Sabitzer was thinking either. If you go in, of course you only do that when the substituted player has left the field. ‚ÄúThe crowning glory was the self-important quote from Michael Gerlinger, who said: 'We are convinced that the DFB sports court can only come to a decision according to the applicable regulations: The result of our 4:1 victory is retained'. That cannot be beaten in terms of self-importance. ‚ÄúThat is weak leadership. If I make a mistake, I have to admit it to myself. But now to push Freiburg into the corner of unsportsmanlike conduct is bottomless.‚Äù Hamann added on on-field issues for Bayern: ‚ÄúThey are far too open at the back. They lack a leader a bit there - one that wins a decisive duel or shows a reaction. ‚ÄúFor me, a leader is someone who makes others better. They don't have one at the back at the moment. ‚Äú[Niklas] Sule could do that, but he's not playing at the moment. The four or five players in front of [Joshua] Kimmich are individuals who you can usually always rely on. But when a game goes like it did in Villarreal, you need some impulse from behind.‚Äù Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Why Uruguay's new striking sensation 'will be the best in the world'","It is a date that has haunted Uruguay for years. For the last decade Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani have ruled the roost in the Celeste attack, taking the nation to three consecutive World Cup knockout rounds as well as victory in the 2011 Copa America. The duo, who were born within three weeks of each other in the city of Salto, are, however, nearing the end,turning 34 at the start of 2021. They may have just enough in the tank to take Uruguay to the World Cup in Qatar in 2022, but time is running out for a possible heir to stake his claim up front. Fortunately for Uruguay, that successor may now be arriving. Darwin Nunez caught the headlines with a fantastic strike in last week's World Cup qualifier against Colombia and now looks like a serious alternative to the Atletico Madrid and Manchester United superstars. Nunez, 21, has plenty in common with the pair. Like Suarez and Cavani he is a small-town boy, growing up on the Brazilian border in the agricultural hub of Artigas. The native of the impoverished riverside  Barrio Pirata  failed in his first trial with Penarol but later succeeded thanks to the efforts of former Uruguay star Jose Perdomo, who took the 15-year-old to Montevideo to join elder brother Junior in the club's youth academy. ‚ÄúThe adaptation process was hard, which almost always happens, more so for the kids who come from up north,‚Äù Under-15s coach Robert Lima recalled to   Ovacion.   Indeed, Darwin almost returned to Artigas when Junior dropped out of Penarol due to family problems. ‚ÄúMy brother was training with the Penarol first team but he had to leave,‚Äù Nunez told   Referi  .  ‚ÄúI was also going to go back to Artigas but he said to me: 'stay here, you have a future. I'm the one who's leaving'.‚Äù Nunez decided to keep working at the Manya, and his persistence paid off when he made his first-team debut in November 2017, aged 18, coming off the bench for ex-Liverpool, Atletico and Argentina star Maxi Rodriguez. The teenager helped Penarol to consecutive Uruguayan titles in 2017 and 2018, as well as victory in the 2019 Apertura before he left for Europe, signing for second-tier Spanish side Almeria for a fee worth ‚Ç¨‚Äé5.4 million. The youngster's first season in Spain proved a stunning successas he netted 16 goals in 32 Segunda Division games to finish fourth in the top scorer rankings, with Almeria narrowly missing out on promotion. ¬°GOLAZO DE URUGUAY! Darwin N√∫√±ez puso el 3-0 ante Colombia con un tremendo derechazo  pic.twitter.com/VryPO9Gw60 Just 12 months after arriving at the club he was on the move again, becoming Benfica's most expensive signing in history as he moved to Lisbon in a ‚Ç¨‚Äé24.5m (¬£22m/$29m) deal in September. Nunez took his time to settle under ex-Flamengo boss Jorge Jesus but has since becomea key part of the set-up, especially in the Europa League where he has helped himself to four goals in just three games to date. He has also contributed six assists for his new club to prove that there is far more to his game than mere goalscoring prowess. ‚ÄúDarwin is a kid, he is barely 21,‚Äù Jesus signalled to reporters in a recent press conference. ‚ÄúThere is a lot still to learn from me here at Benfica about the game, but he has all this ability for decision-making, execution, finishing and speed. ‚ÄúHe was the most expensive player in Benfica history and, I don't know with the pandemic, but he could also be the most expensive player to leave Benfica. ‚ÄúThis kid will be the best in the world and, sadly for me, I will lose him soon.‚Äù  Nunez is making similar waves for the Celeste. On Friday, after Suarez and Cavani had both struck in Barranquilla, Colombia to give the visitors a commanding 2-0 lead, he entered the action for Nicolas de la Cruz. He thenneeded just over 20 minutes to steer a brilliant long-range effort past David Ospina to put the World Cup qualifier beyond doubt and take his Uruguay tally to two in three appearances. Following in the footsteps of two national heroes, the top two scorers in Uruguay history by some distance, promises to be no mean feat. The likes of Abel Hernandez, Santiago Garcia and Giorgian De Arrascaeta have all been labelled as possible successors in the past, while Celta hotshot Maxi Gomez is another big hope for the future, only missing out on November's qualifiers through injury. Nunez, though, is improving at a startling rate, and another big performance in Tuesday's crunch meeting with Brazil - with Suarez's Covid-induced withdrawal opening the door for a starting spot  - would only further his chances of challenging those veteran performers for regular starting time in the Qatar World Cup and beyond.

71,https://www.goal.com/en/news/calvert-lewin-david-vlahovic-arsenal-striker-arteta-rebuild/bltc8a4b9e334d6cda5,"Calvert-Lewin, David, Vlahovic? Arsenal‚Äôs striker hunt the crucial next step in Arteta‚Äôs rebuild","When Arsenal spent ¬£145 million ($200m) last summer to bring in six new faces, there was an acceptance at the club that more was needed. But there was also an understanding that the widespread changes that were required could not all be completed in just one window. So key areas of the squad were identified as priority positions which needed to be addressed, such as playmaker, goalkeeper, right-back and central midfield. And the opportunity to bring in Ben White and pair him alongside Gabriel Magalhaes at centre-back was deemed too good to turn down, while bringing in Nuno Tavares to provide some natural cover for Kieran Tierney at left-back was viewed as essential. Ideally, Mikel Arteta and technical director Edu would have done more, with a new striker high up on their wish list. But with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette still at the club, it was decided that it was not financially viable to bring in another frontman when there were already two experienced forwardson big contracts in the squad. ‚ÄúWhat I would like to explain is that it is not about this summer, it is about the project,‚Äù Edu said during an interview with Arsenal.comshortly after the summer transfer window closed ‚ÄúWe have started the project, we are in the middle, so it is not just about one window, it is window, window, window, window. ‚ÄúI think in this one we consolidated a big step, I am really pleased because the players we signed are what we are looking for. ""We see the balance in the squad is much better, but again this is not the end. People have to understand we are still on the journey to go where this club deserves to be."" Looking at how Arsenal have fared over the opening 14 games of the season, it is clear that the business that was done during the summer has resulted in a far more settled and balanced squad. All of the new additions have made an impact, although it is probably fair to say that Martin Odegaard needs to do a bit more having arrived on a permanent basis from Real Madrid. Defensively things have improved and there is certainly more depth across almost all positions, with the way Tavares and Sambi Lokonga have deputised for Tierney and Granit Xhaka highlighting the smart business that was done. For Arsenal, the key will now be the next step in the squad overhaul, with bringing in a new striker at the top of the agenda. Arteta‚Äôs side travel to Goodison Park to take on Everton on Monday in a good position in the Premier League, despite Thursday‚Äôs frustrating 3-2 defeat at Manchester United. But they have only scored 17 goals in their opening 14 league games - the same number as struggling Newcastle and fewer than newly-promoted Watford. A lack of goals is a clear issue, just as it was last season, with Aubameyang having found the net just four times so far in the league since the start of the campaign. The Gunners skipper has now gone five games without a goal and is looking a shadow of his former self, with some glaring misses blighting his recent performances. ‚ÄúTo put the ball in the net or not can be a difference of millimetres or by a second,‚Äù Arteta said in defence of his captain last week. ‚ÄúAuba has that capacity and hasn‚Äôt lost that capacity.‚Äù But Aubameyang‚Äôs performance at Old Trafford on Thursday night was a perfect illustration of his struggles over the past couple of seasons. He had five efforts on goal, but none of them were struck with the conviction of a striker that had any belief that he was going to score. The 32-year-old scored just 15 goals in all competitions last season and looks on course for a similar sort of number in 2021-22 unless he can quickly find some form. It is a worrying situation for Arsenal, who were banking on their captain to score the goals needed to fire such a young team forward, and it leaves them in a difficult position going into January. Ideally, they would like to bring in a new striker to give them another option during the second half of the campaign, but that is looking highly unlikely. The finances involved and the difficulty of getting players out of their clubs at the midway stage of the season means a summer addition remains the far more likely option when it comes to bolstering Arteta‚Äôs attacking options. By then Lacazette will be out of contract and on the move, freeing up space on the wage bill, while the club could also look to find record signing Nicolas Pepe a new home. Arsenal have been spoken about as having an interest in Everton frontman Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who will miss Monday night‚Äôs game against Arteta‚Äôs side due to injury. The 24-year-old fits the profile of the type of player Arteta and Edu want to bring in and has recently switched agents, with many believing he is gearing up for his next move having spent the past five years on Merseyside. And while Everton would not want to lose their main goal threat, the need to bring in money to invest in their squad could force the Toffees into doing business this summer. ""It is important to do the right thing at the right time,‚Äù Everton boss Rafa Benitez said earlier this month, when discussing the prospect of having to sell players. ""Some clubs have been selling players at the right time and with the money they received they improved the squad. That is something we have to learn. ""The owner is ready to spend money, but we can't spend all the time without bringing money back in.‚Äù It would be no surprise to see Arsenal test Everton‚Äôs resolve to keep Calvert-Lewin at the end of the season, but they will no doubt be looking at other targets. The Gunners are long-term admirers of Lille forward Jonathan David, who is expected to move in the summer, and have good relations with the Ligue 1 club having done business with them when it came to signing Pepe and Gabriel in recent years. Fiorentina hitman Dusan Vlahovic is another player who has been heavily linked, although sources at Arsenal have distanced themselves from suggestions they are serious contenders for the 21-year-old. Whoever Arsenal opt for, it is crucial they get the right man to lead them forward over the next few years. Some smart work in the market last summer has led to a much improved squad, but the next stage of the rebuild will arguably be even more important - with quality over quantity the theme. Arsenal need to find a striker who will not just score at a good rate, but who can also play the high energy pressing game that Arteta wants from his players. If they can do that, then it could take the Gunners to the next level. Copyright ¬© 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

72,https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-arsenal-newcastle-benfica-60m-rated-nunez-premier/blt51277dce16082117,"Man Utd, Arsenal or Newcastle: Is Benfica‚Äôs ¬£60m-rated promise Nunez ready to become a Premier League star?","The future of Uruguayan football all of a sudden looks to be extremely bright. Having flirted with what would have been a disastrous elimination from World Cup qualifying, a change of coach did wonders for the Celeste as Diego Alonso oversaw four consecutive wins to seal their place at Qatar, helped in no small measure by Luis Suarez's eight goal across the CONMEBOL competition. Suarez and Edinson Cavani, Uruguay's undisputed strike kings for more than a decade, are reaching the end of the road, and November's finals may well prove their last hurrah in international colours at the age of 35. Happily for the South American nation, there is another potential star ready to take on that daunting mantle, as Darwin Nunez continues to show he is ready to survive and thrive at the very highest level. Nunez, 22, has been one of the revelations of the 2021-22 season leading Benfica's attack. After a low-key debut campaign following his 2020 move from Almeria in the Spanish second tier, the native of Artigas, an agricultural city on the northern border with Brazil, has exploded this term, smashing 21 goals in just 23 games to lead the Primeira Liga scoring charts and 26 in all competitions for the Lisbon giants. He has also proved crucial in Benfica's thrilling Champions League run. Having scored twice in the group stage to shock Barcelona, Nunez was on target again with the only goal of the match in February's last-16 second leg as Ajax were dumped out of the competition, setting up a clash against Liverpool in the quarter-finals. ‚ÄúIt is a privilege to be in a great European club like Benfica,‚Äù Nunez told UEFA Eleven Sports in a recent interview, while recalling the tough football education he received in Artigas. ‚ÄúWhen the bell rang at school, I always had the ball at my side and I would run out to the field to play with my schoolmates. ‚ÄúWe played barefoot on rocky terrain: it was common for someone to break something or lose a chunk of toe.‚Äù Naturally enough, Nunez's sparkling record in front of goal this term has not gone unnoticed. To follow the reports from across Europe, it would seem that almost every leading side on the continent are interested in acquiring the youngster's services this summer. From Arsenal, Manchester United, Newcastle United and West Ham in the Premier League to Liga giants Barcelona and Atletico Madrid, the striker apparently has plenty of options to choose from. According to agent Edgardo Lasalvia, though, one team in particular is leading the chase. ‚ÄúThe club which has been most attentive and talked to us most about Darwin is Atletico Madrid,‚Äù he explained to A Bola. ‚ÄúI will travel to Europe soon to meet with them and with Benfica. I think Benfica will be open to the idea of making a good sale, but only at the end of the season, at least that's what we've been told.‚Äù What is certain is that the tie against Liverpool represents a golden opportunity for Nunez to show his talents to the rest of the Premier League's big guns, as well as the other teams paying close attention across the continent. While the Reds boast one of the most formidable defences around, their high backline and intense pressing can allow space for strikers to break through, particularly someone like Nunez, who is equipped with the pace, positioning and awareness to loiter on his marker's shoulder before slipping away and picking up the pass behind. Despite having spent most of his career playing either in Uruguay or the Spanish second tier, he has not been daunted by the step up either, and shows every sign of being able to continue improving with every season that passes by. Benfica nevertheless start as rank outsiders in Tuesday's first leg in Lisbon, but with the Uruguayan leading the line and talents like mercurial ex-Queens Park Rangers and Milan playmaker Adel Taarabt and the rejuvenated former Manchester City warhorse Nicolas Otamendi behind him, the Aguila will be hopeful of a famous upset and their first semi-final appearance since 1990. Their ace forward in particular has nothing to lose and everything to gain, as he looks to continue his impressive 2021-22 campaign, which may well culminate in a big-money move to one of Europe's elite and a starring role in the World Cup in November.

73,https://www.goal.com/en/news/ex-man-utd-coach-questions-pogba-s-suitability-to-premier/blta9b1540b6a4b2279,Ex-Man Utd coach questions Pogba's suitability to Premier League,"Former Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen has questioned Paul Pogba's suitability to the Premier League, while predicting that he won't extend his stay with the club beyond the summer. Pogba returned to United from Juventus in a club record ¬£89 million ($116m) deal in 2016, having earned a repuation as one of the top midfielders in Europe at the Allianz Stadium. The Frenchman has since recorded 39 goals and 51 assists in 231 games for the Red Devils, but has only managed to pick up League Cup and Europa League honours, with injury problems preventing him from reaching his full potential. A hamstring issue forced Pogba to miss this season's festive period, and he has only managed one goal in 25 appearances to date, with his latest underhelming showing coming from the bench in a 1-0 loss to Everton. Meulensteen worked with the 28-year-old during his first spell in Manchester, and has suggested that his talents are not best suited to the Premier League. The Dutch coach, who worked as Sir Alex Ferguson's No.2 between 2007 and 2013, thinks the time has come for Pogba to move on, as he told Stadium Astro: ""Failure is a big word, but has Pogba lived up to the expectations? I don‚Äôt think so. ""He knew what the expectations were when he came back, to compete for the Premier League and the Champions League. ""Not everything has clicked with the players around him or the system, does he actually suit the Premier League? ""What frustrated me a little bit is Paul has never really outspoken his commitment to United. He‚Äôs never come out there and said he‚Äôs going to stay and bring United back to where they belong. ""There‚Äôs always been issues over his future and that doesn‚Äôt sit well with the fans. It‚Äôs not just one player though, there‚Äôs many more issues that need to be addressed before United are going to get back on the right track. ""Since he‚Äôs come back it hasn‚Äôt really happened for him or Manchester United. I think he will leave now."" Pogba's current contract is due to expire on June 30 and there has not yet been any sign of him agreeing on an extension at Old Trafford. The World Cup winner has said he is waiting before making a final decision on his future, but has also hinted at a possible switch to Paris Saint-Germain, who have been strongly linked with the midfielder in recent months. Real Madrid have also been credited with an interest in Pogba and a potential return to Juve has been mooted, but he would welcome a move to Parc des Princes to link up with more of his international colleagues. ""Why not? It's always nice to play with your team-mates in the national team and club,"" he has said when asked if he can see himself playing for PSG one day.
