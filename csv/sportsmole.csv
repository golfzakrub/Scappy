After initially appearing to refuse to sign a new deal at the Nou Camp, Barcelona explored the option of selling Dembele in January in order to recuperate a transfer fee, but no such move materialised. Following a return to fitness and a return to form in the team in recent weeks however, Dembele is said to be interested in extending his stay at the Catalan side once more, although Mundo Deportivo are reporting that those talks are currently being held up due to disagreements over a bonus. The report outlines how the 24-year-old's representatives met with the Barcelona hierarchy recently and demanded a bonus be paid to their client upon a potential renewal due to his upcoming free agent status, which they believe he would be able to demand were he to move to a new club. Barcelona are said to disagree with this outlook though, believing they already made a significant investment in the winger when they completed the big-money signing from Borussia Dortmund back in 2017. Despite Barca still being required to adhere to strict La Liga economic restrictions following their financial difficulties, current boss Xavi has highlighted his desire for Dembele to remain at the club beyond the summer.

A €60m (£50m) release clause inserted into Merino's current deal means that negotiations would not be difficult to bring him to the Etihad Stadium, despite his contract running until 2025.

However, according to The Telegraph, Bundesliga side Leipzig are said to have made moves to bring the Dutchman to Germany at the end of the season too. Delays of any confirmation for Ten Hag's move to England are said to have irritated his current employers Ajax, as Leipzig look to potentially capitalise on any collapse in a deal. Although, the report does continue with the suggestion that some sources in Germany suggest that Leipzig's interest in Ten Hag was before they appointed current boss Domenico Tedesco back in December.

Nkunku registered a goal and an assist as Leipzig beat fellow top-four hopefuls Hoffenheim 3-0 in the Bundesliga on Sunday, with his form in particular helping his side climb to fourth in the table following a poor start to the campaign.

According to The Mirror, Ten Hag has issued an ultimatum to the English giants, stating that he is willing to snub an approach if his demands are not met, despite emerging as the favourite for the job. The 52-year-old is said to be keen to shape the playing squad to the demands of his style of football, with emphasis placed on lowering the age profile at Old Trafford. Alongside Paris Saint-Germain boss Mauricio Pochettino, Ten Hag has emerged as a frontrunner to take over in Manchester in the summer, with interim boss Ralf Rangnick set to take up a role as a consultant at the end of the current campaign. Since Rangnick took over from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November, the Red Devils have won eight of their 17 Premier Leauge matches after a defeat to relegation-threatened Everton on Saturday, leaving them seventh in the English top flight as a result, while they dropped out of the Champions League round-of-16 at the hands of Atletico Madrid in March.

The Blues are said to be keen to reignite their youth setup with the capture of the English prospect, while Arsenal are also vying to keep him in their ranks beyond the end of the season.

Such interest comes ahead of Paul Pogba's expected exit from the club, with the French international's contract expiring in the summer and the two parties yet to agree an extension. Phillips is reportedly seen as the most achievable and affordable signing, with West Ham manager David Moyes touting a valuation in the region of £150m to take Rice from the London club. Bellingham, who made the switch to the German giants from Birmingham City in 2020, has consistently been linked with a move back to England and one of its top clubs, with Manchester City and Liverpool also said to be targeting the 18-year-old, who has already made 85 appearances and contributed 10 goals and 17 assists for Der BVB.

However, according to L'Equipe, the two parties have agreed to extend his stay in the French capital, with his current deal running until 2025. The retention of Neymar is said to have been a key priority for Les Parisiens in the midst of the growing likelihood of striker Kylian Mbappe's exit, with the Frenchman set to depart for free in the summer if he does not agree a contract extension. The Brazilian international has now netted five goals in his last two appearances for the current Ligue 1 leaders, most recently hitting a hat-trick in a 6-1 win over Clermont on Sunday.

That said, there is no question the pinch has been felt by a number of clubs with several questions left unresolved as we move into the final hours of the transfer window.  Here the PA news agency looks at some of the key moves to look out for on deadline day.  United's pursuit of Jadon Sancho has been the transfer saga that has dominated the entire summer, refusing to go away even as Borussia Dortmund insist the England forward will not be sold. Alternatives such as Ousmane Dembele have been considered, but with nothing yet materialising frustration amongst fans has only increased as United yet again leave their business late. Edinson Cavani appears set to join in the coming hours, a second signing after Donny van de Beek, but given the Uruguay forward has been a free agent since June it is hard to believe he has been a long-term target. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said earlier this summer he needed reinforcements to make United contenders again. Time is running out to bring them in.  Mikel Arteta remains keen on midfield reinforcements for Arsenal with the focus reportedly now on Chelsea's Jorginho. Arteta was assistant to Pep Guardiola when the Italy international almost joined Manchester City in 2018 – and he has his sights on persuading the 28-year-old to move across London. Jorginho has emerged as the favourite after a move for Lyon's Houssem Aouar faltered while Atletico Madrid's Thomas Partey appears too expensive. Jorginho has captained Chelsea twice this season, however, so convincing Frank Lampard to part with him is unlikely to be easy.  Gareth Bale's arrival from Real Madrid appears to have made Dele Alli surplus to requirements at Tottenham, with the England forward having played only 45 minutes in the Premier League so far this season. Paris St Germain have had one offer for the 24-year-old rejected already but it would be no surprise if he leaves north London before the transfer window closes.  Paris St Germain have also been linked with Everton's Moise Kean, who has failed to settle since joining from Juventus last summer. PSG could face competition from Kean's former employers in Turin, but the odds on him being an Everton player on Tuesday morning are decreasing rapidly. If the 20-year-old does depart, Carlo Ancelotti would need cover for in-form Dominic Calvert-Lewin, and he could turn to his old charge Arkadiusz Milik at Napoli.  We have been hearing Sean Dyche talk about the challenges that face Burnley in the transfer market since June, when the likes of Jeff Hendrick, Aaron Lennon and Joe Hart left Turf Moor on free transfers. That came with the club already short-handed due to injuries, a situation which has not eased in the early weeks of the new campaign. Adding depth seemed a minimum requirement this summer, but the only outfield signing so far has been Dale Stephens from Brighton.   ",positive,liverpool,0
