The Citizens played out an entertaining draw at the Etihad Stadium to remain one point above Jurgen Klopp’s side. Ten Hag or anyone else will need a miracle with this Man Utd… Kevin De Bruyne opened the scoring early on after his shot deflected in off Joel Matip. Diogo Jota quickly responded to equalise for the visitors before Gabriel Jesus gave City a one-goal lead at the break. Sadio Mane scored a minute into the second half to once again equalise for Liverpool, with the score finishing 2-2 after a frantic 90 minutes of football. Guardiola told BBC MOTD:“It is what it is. Against that team it was almost impossible. You have to play these types of games. We are top of the table still so we have a feeling that we miss a huge opportunity to make a stamp but there are many games left. “You are a manager for these types of games of course. The way we play these teams with those threats up front… They are incredible. With our courage of play and the chances we had, especially in the last minute… We defended incredibly well and created a few chances. We go forward. “I don’t have any regrets. They can miss whatever they want. It was positive. It is football and it happens. “We will relax a little bit then prepare for the Champions League.” Guardiola also told BBC Radio 5Live:“I’m really happy with the way we played. We played well first half, it was tough for 10 minutes in the second half but that is normal when you concede. They have quality and a lot of threats, but we performed well. It is football, these things happen. How many managers say, ‘in the last minutes, we can’t concede’, we can concede until the referee blows the whistle. “Yellow cards, red cards, VAR, these things happen. Everybody enjoyed it; City fans, Liverpool fans all around the world; that is the best platform for the Premier League. All the players showcased the Premier League in the right way. “I’m in love with Riyad [Mahrez]; he is an incredible player and person. Today, we thought we needed a different quality up front. We will need him until the end.” Jurgen Klopp described the clash as a “boxing match” – and Guardiola agreed with that statement. “Quite similar,” he told Sky Sports. “He likes that. He likes his punching games. “I think it is a good advert for the Premier League. It was a fantastic game and both teams tried to win. Liverpool is a joy to watch, I know the threats they have and how good they are. I think we performed really well and I’m so proud of my team. “Now both teams know [there are] seven games left, you have to win or it will all be over.” He continued:“I think the second half was quite similar to the first half, except the first 10 minutes when you get a punch. We did really well and played really well. They are so compact and between the lines it is so difficult.” On why he started goalscorer Jesus, the Spaniard said:“Gabriel deserves to play a lot because he is a fantastic person – they all deserve to play. Today, for the quality they have we felt we could find the spaces with these players. Maybe for next weekend we change something.” On Klopp, Guardiola continued:“I don’t know if Jurgen respects me but Jurgen has to know I respect him a lot. He has made me a better manager. His team is always there, they are always aggressive. We are not friends, we never see each other, I have his number but I don’t call him. I have respect for him, but he knows next Saturday [in the FA Cup semi-final] I am going to try and beat him.” ",positive,liverpool,4

The Reds came from behind twice thanks to goals from Diogo Jota and Sadio Mane to remain one point behind league leaders City. An XI of players who killed Treble or Quadruple hopes “I think we can describe it as a boxing fight, both arms down for a second and you get a massive knock,” Klopp told Sky Sports. “I liked a lot of things. I thought we were closer than ever. “The second half start was much better. City really tried obviously things like balls in behind. It makes sense when you have these smart runs. In moments when we tried to breath a little bit another one comes. It was a great game and the result, we have to live with and can live with. “We could do better but in a lot of moments we did really well. The intensity of the game is crazy. It was good fun, I liked it.” Jurgen Klopp takes a moment away from media duties to walk over and salute the #LFC fans still inside the Etihad. pic.twitter.com/mPJJCWTTma — Theo Squires (@TheoSquiresECHO) April 10, 2022 On what he said at half-time with his team 2-1 down, Klopp added: “We showed [our] goal because it was a really good football situation which if we did more we would have chances. I was convinced we could win this game. They were much more direct than us today. They had a more direct idea than us and we wanted to let them run when in possession. “Defensively we were sometimes in a rush, they put us under pressure and we can defend these situations better. The second half was really intense, they needed breaks as well, but their counter attacks are not bad. Their decision making is really good and they always pick the right player. “I think it is a completely fine and deserved draw. We wanted to make sure they see my boys are exceptional as well. “Seven games to go for both teams and we will not stop chasing now that’s for sure. Let’s make sure we are ready for Benfica, for this team at Wembley [in the FA Cup semi-final] and then we will see who will have the better finish.” Klopp also told BBC MOTD:“It was an exceptional game of football. Two heavy-weights, chomping at each other. It’s crazy the intensity. A completely different level. The concentration levels from both teams… “What I liked the most was that in all situations we caused them problems and I felt we made a step in that department. I am happy. Would I have wanted to win the game? Yes. We have to win an awful lot of football and that doesn’t change. If there was one we could draw, it was today. We keep going. “We will use the game. I’m already in the Benfica game but of course we will try to understand the moments. City were more direct than usual and we were less. We will see what they do next time and us. It’s really fine for today. “It was a proper football game. If you played for another club, played yesterday, won it, trained today then watching City vs Liverpool. I don’t know what I would have done to watch it but to be a part of it… I cannot stop being surprised. I love it. Let’s keep going and see where we end up.” ",positive,liverpool,2

Kevin De Bruyne fired the champions into a fifth-minute lead at the Etihad Stadium but Diogo Jota levelled eight minutes later for the second-placed Reds. An XI of players who killed Treble or Quadruple hopes Gabriel Jesus restored City’s advantage before the break but Sadio Mane marked his 30th birthday with a second equaliser for Klopp’s men. Raheem Sterling thought he had put Man City ahead for a third time against his former club but VAR ruled against him in a tight offside decision and substitute Riyad Mahrez hit the post late on. The result ended Liverpool’s 10-match winning league run and left City a point clear with just seven games of the season remaining. The much-hyped contest lived up to expectations with the game starting at a ferocious pace and hardly relenting. Man City were the first to hit their stride with Jesus teeing up Sterling for a glorious chance inside the opening minutes after a De Bruyne break. A remarkable encounter finishes with the points shared#MCILIV pic.twitter.com/STIMCZhSsi — Premier League (@premierleague) April 10, 2022 Sterling seemed certain to score but Alisson Becker came out to meet him and block his shot. City did not dwell on the miss for long as De Bruyne fired them ahead just moments later. The Belgian swerved away from a challenge outside the area and struck a fierce shot that deflected off Joel Matip and crashed in off the post. Liverpool had seen little of the ball up until this point but their response was swift as they carved out an instant equaliser. The Reds built patiently and Mohamed Salah spread play wide to Andrew Robertson. The Scot picked out Trent Alexander-Arnold with a deep cross to the far post and the right-back’s first-time lay-off was clinically side-footed home by Jota. City looked to hit back quickly as Jesus tested Alisson and Rodri had an effort deflected over. City goalkeeper Ederson then gave the home fans a scare when he stumbled attempting to clear a backpass but he scrambled back to sweep off the line with Jota lurking.  The hosts had another opportunity as Rodri headed across goal from a free-kick but John Stones was unable to apply a finishing touch. De Bruyne and Joao Cancelo also had efforts deflected wide but Jesus did restore City’s lead in the 36th minute. The Brazilian got behind the Liverpool defence as Cancelo whipped in a cross and guided a shot past Alisson and in off the bar. Sterling could have added a third soon after but failed to make contact with a Phil Foden cross. Jota spurned a chance to equalise just before the break when he took too long to shoot and was dispossessed by Aymeric Laporte but Mane was more decisive after the restart. Just 47 seconds of the second half had elapsed when Salah played in his fellow forward and Mane made no mistake. Salah then almost teed up Jota for another but Ederson saved. The advantage seemed to swing back City’s way just after the hour when Sterling raced through to calmly slot home but his celebrations were cut short when VAR ruled him narrowly offside. The atmosphere was tense and ratcheted up a notch when referee Anthony Taylor failed to award Liverpool a corner despite a Salah shot taking a deflection off a City defender. City then almost rubbed salt into the wound as Jesus lashed a shot into the side-netting. Both sides pushed until the end and Mahrez almost snatched victory when his long-range free-kick clipped the outside of the post. The Algerian had another chance injury time but his attempted chip flew over. ",negative,liverpool,5

This is according to the Mirror, who say the Bundesliga club opened talks with Ten Hag ‘weeks ago’ and have now made an offer for him to become their new manager. Ten Hag or anyone else will need a miracle with this Man Utd… It is reported that the 52-year-old is ‘taking their offer seriously’ due to being ‘frustrated’ at Man Utd for failing to make him an offer. Leipzig believe that Ten Hag can ‘transform the club into contenders both at home and abroad’. While he is said to be interested in moving to Old Trafford, it is being widely reported that the Red Devils see the Ajax boss as their ideal new manager. Voetbal International journalist Freek Jansen claimed over the weekend that reports of Ten Hag being close to an appointment are wide of the mark. He said: “This week I spoke to several people including Erik ten Hag. “My information is that the only way he will join Manchester United is when everything fits right. His management is working on it, he has a huge list of demands.” He elaborated on that theme during the Pak Schaal Podcast, saying: “Here in the Netherlands, we are less of a shot with bullets. “The information that I, and what other well-versed club watchers around me also have, is that Ten Hag is not out of it yet. “Of course, he thinks United is an attractive club; who doesn’t, and he has also spoken to the club management. But otherwise, he leaves it all to his management.” Due to being fed up with the vast number of questions Ten Hag has been getting asked about Man Utd’s rumoured interest, Ajax banned English media from attending his pre-match press conference on Friday. Sky Sports News reporter Gary Cotterill said:“As Ten Hag was preparing his team to face Sparta Rotterdam, the media team were busily rejecting the applications from the English media to attend the post-match news conference. There will be no radio, no newspapers, no Sky Sports News. “They don’t want him asked, in English, about Manchester United. His English isn’t that great, either. Ajax say he needs to concentrate on winning another [Eredivisie] title. It’s by no means a given – they’re only four points ahead [of PSV] with six games to play.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Ademola Lookman and the impressive Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall struck in the first half to earn a 2-1 win. Gossip: Spurs ‘to battle bitter rivals’ Arsenal for £60m-rated PL star Wilfried Zaha pulled a goal back – following up after Kasper Schmeichel saved his penalty. The goalkeeper had already denied the striker from the spot but VAR had ruled Caglar Soyuncu had encroached. The Foxes are ninth in the Premier League, 11 points behind sixth-placed West Ham with three games in hand, and Rodgers refused to give up the hunt. He said: “We can’t stop until the last whistle goes, we have been really unfortunate and it’s been a real challenge for us without our top players. Now they are coming back and because they are back it means I can rest some and put in a fresh team. 💙 💙 💙 https://t.co/ggYdqbleEo — Leicester City (@LCFC) April 10, 2022 “It’s going to be a big challenge because we are playing right the way through and we’re going to fight until the very end. “I thought Kiernan was outstanding. He is a young player who since he has come into the team he is everything which represents a team of mine. Honest, great industry, runs, works, presses and has got quality. “We were saying to him, as a number eight, the job is to create goals and score goals and he has made a lovely pass for Ade’s first and the second goal he scored was first class. “He has made a real impact with his honesty and quality and I’m delighted for him.” Elsewhere,Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale has slammed his team’s “really poor” performance in their 2-1 loss to Brighton. “It’s not good enough,” Ramsdale said. “Two games on the spin where the first 45 minutes has got away from us. You make it an uphill battle against any team in the Premier League if you’re losing at half-time. “It was a really poor performance and as I said we went to the end but that’s a given at any club, especially this club. When you give a team a step up in the Premier League it’s always hard to get back in the game.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale at the start of March before being hit by sanctions by the UK government. Gossip: Spurs ‘to battle bitter rivals’ Arsenal for £60m-rated PL star He had his assets frozen as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, due to his alleged ties with president Vladimir Putin. Last month it was reported that Abramovichsuffered poisoning during attempts to aid peace talks in Ukraine. After being linked with buyingTurkish Super Lig outfit Goztepe, Abramovich has now made an offer to buy La Liga side Valencia, as per Plaza Deportivo (via Sport Witness). Rival bidder Miguel Zorio claims that current Valencia owner Peter Lim has leaked the Russian oligarch’s bid to the media. “Peter Lim has tried to sell the club in London for 250 million euros and has not succeeded,”Zorio is reported as saying. “Lately, he has leaked to international media that he has two purchase offers, mine and that of the Russian oligarch of Chelsea. “And from here, I tell him that either he puts 50 million every year to compensate for the losses he generates or he sells to us. Whether he likes it or not.” Valencia are up for sale after years of financial mismanagement by Lim, who has watched the Spanish club slide down the La Liga table in recent seasons. Elsewhere,Carlo Ancelotti insists he is ‘not bothered’ by the Real Madrid fans booing Gareth Bale on his return to the Santiago Bernabeu. The 32-year-old made his first appearance at the Santiago Bernabeu this season, coming off the bench in the 74th minute of Madrid’s 2-0 win over Getafe on Saturday. He was met with boos and whistles by some of the home crowd, with Ancelotti laughing off his reception, insisting that he – like Bale – was not concerned. “It didn’t bother me that he was whistled at,”Ancelotti said (via90min) after Bale’s first home appearance in 654 days. “He’s training well and he wants to work hard and help the team. That’s the most important thing. We need everyone and it’s very important for the fans and the players to be united.” ",positive,liverpool,0

The Canaries were 10 points from safety before kick-off, but Lees-Melou’s early deflected strike gave Dean Smith’s men a precious lead and Pukki’s composed finish late on clinched a first Premier League victory in nine attempts. Sky Blues with bright future: Coventry can celebrate season It could be too little too late for bottom club Norwich, who remain in a perilous position but at least has kept 18th-placed Burnley within touching distance and dealt a serious blow to the visitors’ own chances of beating the drop. While this fixture may have been overshadowed by the top-of-the-table clash between Manchester City and Liverpool later in the afternoon, it was a match of vital importance in the battle to remain in the division. The result from the other game between Merseyside and Manchester teams this weekend had served to ramp up the pressure at Carrow Road, but chances were created from the off with Milot Rashica testing Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope before Jay Rodriguez saw a tame header easily saved by Tim Krul at the other end. Playing with an unexpected degree of freedom, it was Norwich who broke the deadlock through Lees-Melou in the ninth minute. 𝗣𝗟𝗠 👍#NCFC | #NORBUR pic.twitter.com/iI66qT9Og4 — Norwich City FC (@NorwichCityFC) April 10, 2022 Burnley failed to deal with Kieran Dowell’s corner and Lees-Melou side-footed into the bottom corner from the edge of the area via a deflection off Josh Brownhill. Pope was left with no chance but played his part soon after to prevent the Canaries doubling their lead. Lees-Melou was again involved and sent Pukki away down the right, with the striker’s low effort stopped by the outstretched right boot of England international Pope. Mathias Normann, urged on by a lifted home crowd, let fly from range minutes later but saw his shot dip too late with Burnley against the ropes.  It had also been that way in midweek against Everton, where Maxwel Cornet’s late goal earned a pivotal three points, and the Ivory Coast attacker saw a stinging drive parried away by Krul in the 26th minute. Sean Dyche’s side were now on top and Aaron Lennon called the home keeper into action with a cross-cum-shot seconds after another low effort by Cornet had been blocked by Grant Hanley. Even with Burnley’s improvement, Norwich remained ahead after Ben Gibson made two crucial blocks late in the half to deny his old team. After an inconspicuous start to the second period, Matej Vydra was introduced by Dyche, who would have wondered how Lees-Melou escaped a second yellow for a foul on Charlie Taylor in the 59th minute. The visitors made another change not long after with Dwight McNeil summoned and his first involvement should have resulted in the leveller. McNeil won possession from Sam Byram near the halfway line and burst into space before his low cross found Cornet at the back post, but the Burnley attacker sliced wide from three yards. Byram’s next contribution was to head away Matthew Lowton’s inviting cross with Rodriguez and Cornet lurking at the back post. A clash of heads between the three produced a three-minute stoppage. Hanley and Rashica wasted big chances to put the game to bed for Norwich before Pukki did wrap up the points. Normann produced a wonderful defence-splitting pass into Pukki, who took a touch and rifled into the bottom corner for his ninth goal of the season with five minutes left. Vydra and Brownhill went close late on for Burnley but it was Norwich’s turn to rediscover that winning feeling. ",positive,liverpool,1

Edwards’ scholarship contract expires at the end of June and the 18-year-old is yet to sign a professional deal with the Gunners, for whom he has scored 17 goals in the youth leagues this season. Chelsea are poised to make a move but will have to wait until their takeover saga is over, due to the sanctions on Roman Abramovich which prevent them from signing new players. Man Utd won’t improve unless they drop two players, Arteta out and… That’s according to GOAL, who add that Arsenal would be due compensation from Chelsea for their development costs. Brighton, Southampton and Leeds are also interested in Edwards, who has the same agent as Bukayo Saka and Folarin Balogun, while a move abroad is also an option with several German clubs said to be tracking the youngster. In other news at Chelsea, Thomas Tuchel has challenged his players to maintain the intensity levels they showed in the 6-0 win over Southampton. The Blues boss was unhappy with the performance in the 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid in midweek but Chelsea responded superbly with a much-improved performance on the south coast. “I think it tells us that we are not a team to escape with results if our input is only 80 to 90 per cent of our energy, commitment and investment,” he said.  “We are a special group when we have the priorities right – if we are committed, if we defend with courage, if we have the hunger and attitude right in challenges. This is our foundation to then show the quality and that we are a strong group and this is a special group of players. “There are some reasons why it’s not always easy for us to have this hunger and the commitment and the physical input, because we come from an awful lot of matches. That’s why it’s not always easy, but this is the reality, we need it, and it’s not about blaming the players. “I can understand there a lot of reasons why it was hard for us after the international break. It just proves the point again today that if we have this right we show our quality.”   ",positive,liverpool,0

Dewsbury-Hall’s first Premier League goal came after a sublime assist for Lookman’s opener to give the Foxes the perfect preparation for Thursday’s trip to PSV. Ten Hag or anyone else will need a miracle with this Man Utd… They go to Eindhoven for their Europa Conference League quarter-final second leg with the tie poised at 0-0 but have momentum after just two defeats in their last 10 outings. Kasper Schmeichel saved two Wilfried Zaha penalties – after VAR ordered a retake – only for the striker to nod in the rebound from the second which gave Palace second-half hope. But a leveller never came and the Foxes move above Palace to ninth in the Premier League. The Eagles saw a seven-game unbeaten run come to an end, which had propelled them to Wembley for next week’s FA Cup semi-final with Chelsea. A super Sunday for the Foxes! 🥰 Delivered by @ParimatchUK#LeiCry pic.twitter.com/RjFpjFn8dp — Leicester City (@LCFC) April 10, 2022 Leicester boss Brendan Rodgerscompletely reshaped his team from Thursday’s European draw and seven changes underlined the Foxes’ priorities. But they made light of the reshuffle, even if they had to survive two scares before taking total control. The first came when Zaha failed to find the target following Jeff Schlupp’s fine pass while the second arrived after 18 minutes when Zaha slipped in Jean-Philippe Mateta. The striker tricked his way past Caglar Soyuncu and Schmeichel’s excellent low save turned his drive behind before Joachim Andersen headed the resulting corner wide. Yet, despite the chances, there was no tempo to the game with both sides taking time to find their stride. Youri Tielemans’ ambitious effort had Vicente Guaita scrambling but the game needed a flashpoint – which finally came six minutes before the break when Leicester grabbed the lead.  James Justin nipped in to pinch Marc Guehi’s pass off Zaha and Tielemans found Dewsbury-Hall whose excellent pass picked out Lookman to cut inside Andersen and drill past Guaita. It then got better for the Foxes just before the break when they doubled their advantage. Guehi allowed Justin’s hopeful ball under his foot and Patson Daka seized on the chance. He crossed for Dewsbury-Hall on the edge of the area and the midfielder engineered space by holding off Cheikhou Koyate before brilliantly firing in his third goal of the season. After the break the hosts continued where they left off as Guaita turned Tielemans’ effort over 35 seconds after the restart. Palace wilted quickly after conceding and Andersen’s awful clearance and subsequent reckless challenge on Daka underlined their sloppy nature. But they were handed a lifeline in the 64th minute when Tielemans brought down Jordan Ayew in the area. Zaha’s awful penalty was saved low to his left by Schmeichel only for VAR to order a retake because the goalkeeper encroached. Again Zaha stepped up and produced a wretched spot kick which Schmeichel stopped but the ball bounced kindly for the striker to nod in the rebound. Palace, though, were unable to conjure a leveller despite a couple of scrambles and Leicester saw them game out. ",positive,liverpool,0

Two second-half goals lifted the Bees 12 points clear of the Premier League drop zone after a Sunday afternoon stroll in the west London sunshine. An XI of players who killed Treble or Quadruple hopes Mbeumo lashed in the opener after being teed up by Toney, and then returned the favour for his strike partner as Toney grabbed his 14th goal of the season. For West Ham it was another dent in their fading hopes of a top-four finish, and they were also dealt a potentially massive blow with Thursday night’s Europa League second leg against Lyon in mind when defender Kurt Zouma was forced to limp out of the action midway through the first half. Zouma had taken a hefty kick to the ankle from Christian Norgaard five minutes earlier and seemingly failed to shake off the knock.

Brentford were still buzzing from last weekend’s thumping 4-1 win at Chelsea and Mbeumo had the game’s first effort on target when he headed Rico Henry’s cross straight at Lukasz Fabianski. The lively forward then tested West Ham’s Polish keeper further with a fierce drive at the near post. Then, when Fabianski punched a Christian Eriksen corner which was threatening to curl straight in, Mbeumo lashed the rebound over the crossbar. Eriksen grew into the match as the first half wore on and his free-kick was headed narrowly over his own crossbar by Vladimir Coufal before Fabianski held the Dane’s low, skidding drive. West Ham, perhaps showing the effect of Thursday night’s first-leg exertions, threatened only once in the opening half when Tomas Soucek headed a cross from fellow Czech Coufal into the arms of Bees keeper David Raya. Mbeumo got his reward two minutes into the second half when he latched on to Toney’s clever flick and lashed a fierce angled shot past Fabianski. It was the French forward’s fourth goal of the season and his first since December. Moyes sent on Said Benrahma to face his old club, but before the Algerian could get a meaningful touch, Brentford doubled their advantage with a slick move. Yoane Wissa fed Henry down the left and the full-back’s cross was steered back across goal by Mbeumo for Toney to head in the simplest of finishes and wrap up a deserved win. ",positive,liverpool,0

The Egypt international is out of contract in 2023 and does not appear to be close to signing a new deal at Anfield. Pep has Klopp sussed – but Thiago can lift Liverpool Salah has been a revelation at Liverpool since joining from AS Roma for £37million in 2017. He has scored153 goals for the Reds in 241 appearances. The 29-year-old was asked about his contract situation earlier this week, insisting that it is not right to discuss the matter with Liverpool competing to win an unprecedented quadruple. When asked what he can reveal about his contract situation, Salah toldSky Sports:“Well not much but honestly, but what I can say is there many things people don’t know about it. “I can’t be selfish and talk about my situation. We are in the most important period for the team so I have to just talk about the team, focus on what is coming with the team and that is the most important thing. “That is all I can say. Hopefully we are going to be more optimistic and see what is going to happen.” Salah has been warned by Liverpool legend Carragher that he could ruin his legacy if he doesn’t sign a new contract at the club. He believes Anfield is “the best place for him” and has said playing elsewhere could lead to a similar decline, and loss of legacy, to former Reds striker Torres. “I still think Mo Salah will sign a new contract. Liverpool is the best place for him, he became a superstar at Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp brings out the best in him. It wouldn’t be a sensible move for him to leave,” Carragher told Sky Sports (via the Express). “The football he’s playing now, he’s playing for one of the best managers in the world, one of the best teams in the world, what he’s done over the last five years makes him one of the best players to ever wear a Liverpool shirt. “I just think it would be sad if he were to move on, maybe to a rival in this country, he’d lose his legacy at Liverpool. You look at what happened to Fernando Torres going to Chelsea, and I just don’t think it would be great for his career. Where could he go that’s better than Liverpool right now?” ",positive,liverpool,10

Gossip: Spurs ‘to battle bitter rivals’ Arsenal for £60m-rated PL star Speaking to the club website, Ramsdale lamented the “uphill battle” that Arsenal gave themselves by going 2-0 down, seemingly not having learnt from their sluggish start in Monday’s 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace. “It’s not good enough,” he said. “Two games on the spin where the first 45 minutes has got away from us. You make it an uphill battle against any team in the Premier League if you’re losing at half-time. “We were not in the rhythm of the game, that’s unlike us, especially at home where we’ve normally started really well all season. “It was a really poor performance and as I said we went to the end but that’s a given at any club, especially this club. When you give a team a step up in the Premier League it’s always hard to get back in the game.  “One-nil down is tough enough, two-nil down in the Premier League is even harder. So if we’d have got the first goal back even earlier we might have pushed and pushed but there was too much to do in the end. “This was supposed to be the reaction game but it wasn’t. We’ve lost and not managed to pick up any points and next week is even bigger. I think we just need to go out there and be free and play our game, you know? “It’s a game of football and I think in the first half we were very tense and slow so we just need to go out there next week, trust what the manager and the coaching staff are saying and go and play our football, which we’ve done all season.”   ",negative,liverpool,0

The Gunners will need to bring at least one new striker to the Emirates Stadium at the end of the season with Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah set to leave on free transfers. Arsenal also terminated Pierre-Emerick Aubamayang’s contract at the end of January and the Gabon international joined Barcelona on a free. Man Utd won’t improve unless they drop two players, Arteta out and… The Gunners know the exits of Lacazette and Nketiah will leave them light on forwards and Spanish publication Nacional claims that Arsenal are now the ‘new favourite’ to land Jovic from Real Madrid. It is understood that Arteta ‘has chosen’ Jovic to be the new star striker for the north London club next season with the Gunners said to have ‘appeared strongly’ for his signature. The Serbia international – who moved to Real Madrid in June 2019 for a reported €60m – ‘would have the mission of replacing’ Lacazette. Nacional insist that Jovic – who turned down a number of offers to join Los Blancos – ‘feels cheated and disappointed’ at Real after being promised a ‘very important’ by president Florentino Perez. It is now ‘impossible to think that he will continue’ at Real Madrid beyond this season with the 24-year-old failing to start a La Liga match this campaign. Real are ready to sell and will accept any offers of€30m or more, with Roma boss Jose Mourinho hoping to rival Arsenal for the striker. Meanwhile, Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale was disappointed by the Gunners’ “very tense” first-half performance in their 2-1 loss to Brighton on Saturday. “This was supposed to be the reaction game but it wasn’t,” Ramsdale told Arsenal’s official website. “We’ve lost and not managed to pick up any points and next week is even bigger. I think we just need to go out there and be free and play our game, you know? “It’s a game of football and I think in the first half we were very tense and slow so we just need to go out there next week, trust what the manager and the coaching staff are saying and go and play our football, which we’ve done all season. “It’s not good enough.

Bale joined the Spanish giants for £90m in 2013 after a terrific spell with Tottenham Hotspur. Man City and Liverpool await face-off after friendly fire He has won four Champions Leagues and two La Liga titles, scoring 106 goals in 258 appearances across all competitions for Los Blancos. Despite his success at the Santiago Bernabeu, Bale has never managed to endear himself to the Real Madrid fanbase. Last month, Spanish newspaper Marca were very critical of the Welshman, describing him as a ‘parasite’over their perception that he is robbing the club by running down his contract. Bale has struggled with injuries in recent seasons and has missed numerous games this term. He has made seven appearances for Madrid in 2021/22.

The 32-year-old made his first appearance at the Santiago Bernabeu this season, coming off the bench in the 74th minute of Madrid’s 2-0 win over Getafe on Saturday. He was met with boos and whistles by some of the home crowd, with Ancelotti laughing off his reception, insisting that he – like Bale – was not concerned. “It didn’t bother me that he was whistled at,” Ancelotti said (via 90min) after Bale’s first home appearance in 654 days. “He’s training well and he wants to work hard and help the team. That’s the most important thing. We need everyone and it’s very important for the fans and the players to be united.” Bale is out of contract at the end of the season and is widely expected to leave on a free transfer. Meanwhile,Alphonso Davies hinted that Cristiano Ronaldo should be Man Utd captain after mocking the club’s decision to appoint Harry Maguire as skipper. “Can you guys imagine [that] you’re Ronaldo, right?”Davies said on hisTwitchchannel.“One of the greatest players ever, in the 21st century. “Harry Maguire is your captain.

14,https://www.football365.com/news/gotze-mocked-liverpool-transfer-admission-psv-dortmund-world-cup,‘Jesus’ – World Cup winner mocked over Liverpool transfer admission,"Former Netherlands international Rene van der Gijp has mocked Mario Gotze for admitting he should’ve moved to Liverpool when he had the chance. Gotze had his breakthrough season at Dortmund in 2010-11 under Jurgen Klopp before announcing himself on the international stage at the 2014 World Cup, bagging the winning goal as Germany lifted the title. He then moved to Bayern Munich for three seasons before returning to Dortmund, despite interest from his former manager Klopp at Liverpool. Pep has Klopp sussed – but Thiago can lift Liverpool Gotze, who is now playing for PSV in the Eredivisie, said this week that he “should have joined Liverpool” when he had the chance to. “We are still in touch and we spoke back then about me coming to Liverpool,” Gotze said in an interview with the Daily Mail. “But I wasn’t in a state of mind where I could consider it, that’s why it didn’t happen. “Do I regret it? It’s always difficult to look back but if you ask me now then yeah, I should have joined Liverpool for sure. I just made a wrong decision but it’s not a regret.” But Van der Gijp, who has been less than impressed with Gotze’s performances during his time in the Netherlands, claims Gotze would “never have played” for Liverpool. “I really thought that he had a very good image of himself,”Van der Gijp said onToday Inside (via MSN). “That he thinks: I will play in the Netherlands; I am only seventy per cent fit. And then I’ll be fine, against the NECs of this world. “But recently, I heard that he would rather have chosen Liverpool. Then I think: Yes, goddamn, you would never have played there, man. “With Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané. Then I think: Jesus, how can you say that?” Ahead of Liverpool’s match against Manchester City on Saturday,Klopp admits he would have been disappointed had his side not produced a response to the Citizen’s 14-point advantage at the top of the table. Klopp said: “The 100 percent truth is that what we did was normal. If we hadn’t tried I would be disappointed. “If you go into the season and the only thing you have is to win the league, then we are not that club, we can’t be that club because of City and the other teams (also wanting to win it). “So, not winning the league will be disappointing but there are other things to go for qualification for Champions League, other cup competitions, the Champions League. “There is a lot to go for and for those you need momentum and you need rhythm. Whatever situation you are in, come early January it’s a situation, so work from there and don’t suffer because of it. “If the gap is too big then close it – to one point. That was not about us, we just won the games but City didn’t win all their games. “That is what I expected from us. I don’t expect us to win all the games, but to try constantly and that’s what we did. “We knew it was 14 points but we didn’t care we just had to win as many points as possible until the end of the season that situation doesn’t change.”  ",positive,liverpool,9

Ronaldo, a five-time Ballon d’Or winner, has failed to live up to expectations since his return to Old Trafford, which many supporters hoped would put United in contention for the Premier League title. Instead, the Red Devils are seventh in the table, six points off fourth-place Tottenham Hotspur with seven games to go. Ronaldo has netted 18 goals in all competitions but has lacked consistency at times, with his all-round performances leaving a lot to be desired. Man Utd won’t improve unless they drop two players, Arteta out and… With Erik ten Hag set to be appointed as United’s next manager, club chiefs have concluded that Ronaldo’s reluctance to press will be problematic in the Dutchman’s high-octane system, meaning he will be ‘encouraged to leave in the summer’, according to MailOnline. Ronaldo’s display against Everton will have done little to alter this view. He failed to have an impact on the game and his frustration was laid bare at full-time, when he appeared to smash a fan’s phone on the floor. The mother of the young fan claimed he had been “assaulted” by Ronaldo after the game. She told the Liverpool Echo:“At full-time the Man United players started walking off. We were in the Park End so we were right by the tunnel where they came walking past – my son was there videoing them all. “He filmed all the United players walking through. And then he lowered his phone because Ronaldo had pulled down his sock and his leg was bleeding. He lowered his phone to see what it was – he didn’t even speak.  “Ronaldo then just walked past, with a terrible, terrible temper and smashed the phone out of my son’s hand and carried on walking. “I was crying, I was shook up, Jacob was in complete shock – he’s autistic and he’s got dyspraxia as well, so he didn’t really digest what was happening until he’s come home now. “He’s an autistic boy and he’s been assaulted by a football player, that’s how I see it as a mum.”   ",negative,liverpool,1

Ronaldo re-joined the Red Devils last summer in a move that led many to believe the Premier League giants would compete on all fronts this season. Man Utd won’t improve unless they drop two players, Arteta out and… The Portugal captain hit the ground running at Old Trafford, scoring a brace on his second debut against Newcastle before netting some crucial goals in the Champions League. Despite his 18 goals in all competitions this season, Ronaldo has been heavily criticised for his performances with Man Utd enduring a poor season. They are expected to miss out on the top four and were knocked out of the Champions League in the last 16, Carabao Cup in the third round and FA Cup in the fourth round. Maguire has also had his fair share of critics this campaign. Many fans, pundits and former players have urged Man Utd interim boss Ralf Rangnick to drop the England defender. The German has remained faithful in Maguire, however. He has made 33 appearances this term across all competitions. Bayern Munich left-back Davies says he can’t believe Maguire is Man Utd captain, insisting that he has no idea why a player of Ronaldo’s calibre is being led by the 29-year-old.

The force is appealing for witnesses after footage on social media emerged which appeared to show the Portuguese smashing a phone out of a Toffees fan’s hand and onto the ground as he limped off towards the tunnel followinghis side’s 1-0 loss at Goodison Park. Man Utd striker Ronaldo later issued an apology for his “outburst” via social media and invited the supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford “as a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship”. A spokesperson for Merseyside Police said: “We can confirm that we are liaising with Manchester United Football Club and Everton FC following reports of an alleged assault at the Everton v Manchester United football match at Goodison. “As players were leaving the pitch at 2.30pm, it was reported that a boy was assaulted by one of the away team as they left the pitch.” ",positive,liverpool,0
17,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-arsenal-1-2-brighton-villa-0-4-spurs-son-heung-min-partey-conte-arteta,Arteta’s Partey plan backfires as Spurs accept another gift…,"Man Utd and Arsenal have presented Tottenham with their path to the Champions League. Antonio Conte’s men won’t look a gift horse in the mouth… Mikel Arteta took it upon himself to apologise to Arsenal fans on behalf of his players last week. But the Gunners boss should be seeking atonement for his own mistakes that made amends impossible against Brighton, all the while inviting Spurs to strengthen their grip on fourth place. Arsenal lost three goals and three points at Crystal Palace on Monday at the same time as being deprived of arguably their most important player. A thigh injury ended Thomas Partey’s evening at Selhurst Park prematurely and it remains unclear when the Ghanian might return. On today’s evidence, that cannot happen soon enough for Arteta. Since the turn of the year, Partey has excelled at the base of Arsenal’s midfield. The big-money buy from Atletico Madrid struggled for much of his first year in north London but since returning from AFCON, Partey has found his feet, screening Arsenal’s back four off the ball while dictating their tempo on it and offering the Gunners’ most effective route out of any opponents’ press. Partey was pocketed by Palace on Monday but the midfielder was hardly alone in having an off-night. A reaction was expected against Brighton but, largely because of Partey’s absence, it never came. At least not until they were 2-0 down at the Emirates. Arteta had a couple of options to replace his midfielder. The first and simplest was to shift Granit Xhaka into a deeper role; another was to pair the Swiss midfielder with Albert Sambi Lokonga and allow the pair to share the burden. Instead, Arteta opted to give Lokonga the job of pivoting his midfield, which he has yet to prove capable of, hence why the 22-year-old has started only once since November.  F365 Says: Ten Hag or anyone else will need a miracle with this Man Utd… Instead of double-pivoting with Xhaka, Arteta chose to field the midfielder at left-back, apparently reluctant to give Nuno Tavares another chance after his poor performance at Palace. It was a decision that backfired everywhere, with Lokonga swamped in a midfield that Partey might have danced through, while Xhaka looked every bit the central midfielder filling in as a full-back. There is obviously no like-for-like replacement for Partey in Arteta’s preferred system so the Arsenal manager may have to change his shape, especially if the Ghanian is missing for a large chunk of a tough-looking run-in.  There are no such concerns for Tottenham. Everything seems to be coming up Conte… The Spurs boss was able to watch United and Arsenal soil themselves before naming an unchanged side to face a woefully inconsistent Aston Villa. Three minutes in Heung-min Son gave Tottenham a lead with a glorious waft of his left foot. The goal, though, served to rouse Villa and, if their tackling is any indication, anger them. The Villans made sure there was a little something extra in every 50-50 and most of the 60-40s they contested. It was plainly a tactic decreed by Steven Gerrard, who pleaded for a 90-minute performance to be proud of. Villa got going more quickly this week than last Saturday at Wolves, but not before the early damage was done. Matty Cash took it out on Matt Doherty, who has been so impressive in Spurs’ re-emergence in the top-four race under Conte. Doherty tried twice to carry on but a third check from the physio prompted the end of his afternoon. For Conte, though, the loss of a key man was no problem. It simply meant the arrival of Sergio Reguilon, who might argue that he offers better balance as a natural left-sider. Seeing Doherty depart and Villa maintain their attempts to literally make their mark on their visitors might have seen Spurs wilt, or at least lapse in concentration. But Conte’s side were dead-eyed in their focus, asserting their retribution in front of goal. 7 – Hugo Lloris made seven saves in the opening 45 minutes against Aston Villa; since Opta have this data available (from 2006-07), it's the most by a Tottenham goalkeeper in the first half of any Premier League match. Resistance. pic.twitter.com/Rcau7gx4oi — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 9, 2022  Tottenham’s dominance was established with three goals glorious in their simplicity and a fourth that showcased their quality and superiority. Where a loose ball precipitated their opener, their second arrived via Route One, with Harry Kane nodding Hugo Lloris’s clearance intoDejan Kulusevski’s pass. Kane did the same again for Son’s second before the South Korean’s hat-trick came after Villa’s centre-backs, Ezri Konsa and Tyrone Mings, had been nutmegged and sat down respectively. Spurs’ creative movements and their resistance in the face of Villa’s force offered the starkest contrast possible to what Manchester United phoned in at Goodison at lunchtime. Arsenal may have showed Tottenham a clear path to the Champions League, but it should not be forgotten that United allowed them a free run at Conte when the Italian was available. Since Conte was appointed, only City and Liverpool have accrued more points, the last 12 of which have come as a maximum haul from four games that have put Tottenham in control of the fight for fourth. It’s hardly a foregone conclusion, with only three points separating Spurs and Arsenal who have a game in hand. But Conte’s side are purring and peaking while Arteta exacerbates the Gunners’ weakness. ",positive,liverpool,1
18,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-everton-1-0-man-utd-ten-hag-rangnick-pochettino,Ten Hag or anyone else will need a miracle with this Man Utd…,"Erik ten Hag or Mauricio Pochettino? Unless either of the prospective Manchester United managers can demonstrate a proficiency in sorcery, it hardly matters. That was evident yet again when the Red Devils went to Everton and chucked in the battle of the banter clubs. With these players, this dearth of character, this shameful lack of motivation, this half-arsed hierarchy, what chance has any new manager got? Any United fans pinning their hopes on either Ten Hag or Pochettino riding into Manchester to straighten out such a chaotically assembled squad is kidding themselves. Ten Hag reportedly proposed a five-year plan to rebuild the football club. On recent evidence, the Ajax coach could be written off as a dreamer; he will need ten. To say that the defeat to Everton is their worst performance of the season – the reaction on many on social media in the immediate aftermath of the final whistle at Goodison Park – perhaps feeds off a hearty portion of recency bias. Because United have played as hopelessly as that on a few occasions this season. And last season. And each time it gets harder to stomach, for the United fans who’ve fought the notion that their team is comprised largely of bluffers, and the neutrals scarcely able to fathom what this great club has become. So often have the players revealed their barely-concealed disdain for the travelling supporters that this result, to a team deep in the mire and themselves lacking the necessary bollocks, comes as no surprise. To an Everton side, pinned by Sean Dyche this week as one that ‘don’t know how to win’, the sight of the United circus rolling in to town must have been manna from heaven. Early winners: Everton back to f***ing basics and b*llocks The Toffees, themselves a shambles from top to bottom, at least had a cause to fight for. United did too – the top four – but you wouldn’t know it. Not from their intensity here, or last week at home to a Leicester side who spent the first hour waiting to beaten before they realised: “Lads, it Man Utd.” It took Everton and their fans just under half an hour to catch on too. Few grounds can be as intense as Goodison but initially it was just tense, which is understandable given what the home supporters have been subjected to by Frank Lampard’s side of late. United did not even need to quieten the crowd because the Toffees have spent the last few weeks doing that for them. Nor did it seem that it was the Everton players who geed up the Gwladys Street, more that Evertonians sussed that, actually, United really are as bad as reports had suggested. As if they couldn’t quite believe it without seeing for themselves. The opening goal, of course, swelled that belief among the Goodison faithful. And, of course, it came as a consequence of United failing to perform their basic tasks. Nemanja Matic, seemingly wading through quicksand all afternoon, failed to scan upon receiving the ball in midfield and gave up possession far too easily; Aaron Wan-Bissaka tracked back an overhit pass for Richarlison with his customary apathy whenever there is no prospect of a slide tackle; Matic offered an impression of a tackle to deny Alex Iwobi; before Anthony Gordon’s shot found the net via the shell of Harry Maguire. For the remaining hour, United did what they do best. They pretended. They pretended to attack, pretended to tackle, pretended to care. But there was no disguising their lack of intent. We could pick on individuals, but what’s the point? Every technical, tactical and mental deficiency has been nit-picked already on these pages and there was no new or interesting conclusion to draw aside from to question how far a group of players can actually drift. Like last week, this performance simply served to reaffirm every pessimistic view of these United players, with Ralf Rangnick surely more gloomy than anyone of their prospects. The interim manager has carried the air of a man who can scarcely believe what he is witnessing on a daily basis and the German called it on Friday: “Game plan and tactics is one thing tomorrow but the other thing, and probably the most important thing, is mentality, attitude, physicality.” The message, evidently, is yet to pierce the bubble these United players reside in.  Yes, some will go. Not enough since the club is still obliged to field 11 players on the opening day of next season, but there will be a clear-out of sorts. There has to be. United finished with a midfield of Juan Mata and Paul Pogba, both of whom are counting down the days to the end of their contractual obligations. Jesse Lingard too will be off and many of their team-mates will watch with envy as they skip towards the door. For Marcus Rashford, once more it looked like the novelty of playing for his boyhood club has vanished, while Wan-Bissaka appears to know that he can’t get away with it for much longer. But Pochettino or, more likely, Ten Hag will still have to work with many of these players, under these owners. For both, it’s not yet too late to block Richard Arnold’s phone number.

19,https://www.football365.com/news/xi-players-killed-treble-quadruple-liverpool-manchester-city,An XI of players who killed Treble or Quadruple hopes,"Man City and Liverpool have a chance to further their respective Treble and Quadruple hopes when they meet. This XI ended them in the past. Liverpool and Manchester City clash at the Etihad on Sunday, with the winners gaining the upper hand in the race for the Premier League title. Jurgen Klopp is gunning for an unprecedented Quadruple, while Pep Guardiola is hoping to lead his team to the Treble. With both teams looking set to reach the last four of the Champions League and the two sides also meeting in the semis of the FA Cup, it promises to be a thrilling week. Here’s an XI made up from players who helped to stop sides who could’ve won a Treble or Quadruple. Goalkeeper: Fabian Carini Twenty years ago, Arsenal claimed a third Double after going on a 13-game winning streak to clinch the league title and beat pre-Abramovich era Chelsea in the FA Cup final. However, a maiden Champions League crown evaded the Gunners as they crashed out of the competition in the much-maligned second group phase. Arsene Wenger’s men faced Juventus in the final match and as the Bianconeri had already been eliminated they fielded a weakened team. But back-up keeper Fabian Carini made the most of a rare start, saving a Thierry Henry penalty to keep the match at 0-0, before a late Marcelo Zalayeta goal ended Arsenal’s Treble chances. If you fancy a goalkeeper challenge, try naming the Deportivo keeper who saved a penalty from Henry a week before the Juventus game.  Centre-back: Gerry Ryan Versatile Irishman Gerry Ryan will have to a do a job at centre-back for this side, with the former Brighton man playing a part in halting Liverpool’s bid for a Quadruple in 1984. Ryan also found the back of net in 1983 to help the Seagulls knock out the Reds en route to the FA Cup final and despite suffering relegation in the same year, the south coast side proved to be a thorn in Liverpool’s side as a second-tier team, with Ryan scoring again as Joe Fagan’s men exited the cup in the fourth round. It proved to be the only blot on their campaign: the Anfield faithful went on to watch their heroes lift the First Division title, League Cup and European Cup.  Centre-back: Daniel Agger Chelsea’s 2011/12 season will be remembered for a remarkable run to the Champions League final and the big-game heroics of Didier Drogba that helped the Blues to an unlikely triumph in Europe. Caretaker boss Roberto Di Matteo had already guided his players to FA Cup glory against Liverpool – a victory that contained an element of revenge. Kenny Dalglish’s team were the only side in the Premier League to do the double over Chelsea that year, with Daniel Agger scoring in a 4-1 win for the Reds in May, denying the Stamford Bridge outfit a chance at making the top four.   Centre-back: Phil Jagielka Ten years after their Treble triumph in 1999, Manchester United looked to be on course for going one better after beating Tottenham on penalties in the 2009 League Cup final. Despite leading his side to a Champions League final for the second year in a row and adding another Premier League title to his vast collection, Sie Alex Ferguson was left furious after watching his players blow their Quadruple chances following a penalty shootout defeat to Everton in the semis of the FA Cup. Phil Jagielka converted the winning spot-kick and to make matters worse for United, the Everton defender had earlier gotten away with what looked to have been a clear foul on Danny Welbeck in the box.  Right-wing: Kai Havertz Last year it was the blue side of Manchester gunning for a Quadruple but Chelsea twice thwarted Pep Guardiola’s lofty ambitions. The League Cup and the Premier League crown both ended up at the Etihad but defeat in the FA Cup semis to Thomas Tuchel’s men was followed up by a loss in Europe to the same side. Kai Havertz scored the only goal in Porto as Manchester City came out second-best in their first Champions League final, while the result also extended Guardiola’s drought in the competition to ten years.  Central midfield: Jimmy Greenhoff If Liverpool can defeat Manchester City on Sunday and find a way past the Citizens in their FA Cup clash the following weekend, Manchester United will be the next obstacle facing Jurgen Klopp in the hunt for the Quadruple. The Red Devils will be out for revenge after their 5-0 humbling at Old Trafford earlier in the season and they have previous when it comes to denting trophy aspirations at Anfield. 1977 saw Liverpool lift the first of their six European Cups and Bob Paisley also guided his side to a league championship. However, defeat in the FA Cup final prevented a then-unprecedented Treble, Jimmy Greenhoff scoring the winner for Manchester United in a 2-1 win for Tommy Docherty’s side.

The Red Devils memorably defeated the Blues on penalties in Moscow to clinch a third European Cup win, but a spot-kick ended their FA Cup chances at the quarter-final stage. Eventual winners Portsmouth secured the shock win after Milan Baros was fouled by Tomasz Kuszczak in the box, which led to the Polish keeper receiving his marching orders. Sulley Muntari then smashed the ball past stand-in keeper Rio Ferdinand to send Pompey to the semis at United’s expense.  Left-wing: David Ginola Manchester United’s thrilling Treble-winning story in 1999 was famous for dramatic turnarounds at home and abroad but a quarter-final tie against Tottenham in the League Cup proved to be the one time the Red Devils couldn’t snatch victory after going behind. Ferguson selected a weakened side and Spurs took full advantage, running out 3-1 winners. French winger David Ginola was at his imperious best, setting up Chris Armstrong for a goal before sealing passage to the semis with a superb long-range strike that killed off any chance of a trademark comeback.  Striker: Kubilay Turkyilmaz After winning the inaugural Premier League title in 1993, the following campaign marked Manchester United’s first foray into Europe’s premier competition for over 20 years. Unfortunately for Ferguson’s men it was a short adventure, the Red Devils going out to Turkish champions Galatasaray in the second round on away goals. Swiss international Kubilay Turkyilmaz bagged a brace in a 3-3 draw at Old Trafford to end any hopes United had of a clean sweep that season. However, a historic Double was completed come May and a domestic Treble was a whisker away after defeat to Aston Villa in the League Cup final.  Striker: Samuel Eto’o Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has put a huge dent in Chelsea’s hopes of retaining the Champions League this year but back in 2010, the Italian was masterminding the Blues to a domestic Double in his first season at Stamford Bridge. Reigning champions Manchester United were pipped in the race for the Premier League, while relegated Portsmouth lost out in the FA Cup final. However, Inter Milan dashed any dreams of a hat-trick of trophies in the Champions League round of 16, with the Nerazzurri guided to their own Treble by former Blues boss Jose Mourinho.  Striker: Fernando Llorente A clean sweep of all the domestic trophies available to Manchester City in 2019 meant that a maiden win in the Champions League would’ve made it the most successful season any English side has ever had. However, a memorable quarter-final clash with Tottenham ended up with the Citizens crashing out on away goals after a bonkers second leg at the Etihad. Fernando Llorente scored the decisive goal after a check for handball was completed and more VAR drama was to ensue following a decision to rule out a late Raheem Sterling strike for offside.

20,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-coventry-bright-future-mark-robins-championship-promotion,Sky Blues with bright future: Coventry can celebrate season,"Their unlikely promotion charge is over but Coventry City have a phenomenal season to look back on and the brightest of futures ahead. For many fanbases, the dashing of play-off dreams this late into the season would land somewhere on a bitter scale from crushing disappointment to ‘[insert manager X] out’ memes littering replies to every social media post put out by the club. In the case of Coventry City supporters, Wednesday night’s defeat to Nottingham Forest likely put paid to any chance of promotion. But it matters not when considering the resounding success of this campaign. Even the most optimistic of Sky Blues’ fans could not have foreseen Mark Robins’ side legitimately challenging for a place in the Premier League so deep into the season. A four-game winless run since hitting Sheffield United for four almost a month ago has left Coventry eight points off the Blades in sixth place with just six games remaining. Coventry’s chances of being in the top six were not fleeting. They were there for the majority of the first half of the season, but have not returned since dropping out towards the end of November. Since then, they have flirted with those positions but remained on the periphery. QPR and Blackburn were the middle of the season’s dark horses and Luton Town are the underdogs finishing in style; Coventry got the ball rolling in giving us hope of an unexpected team making their way to the top flight. Best season we've had at the Ricoh.Some unbelievable games up there throughout the past 10 months.I've got memories of games with my boys and mates that we'll never forget.Mark Robins and the team have done us proud. — Mark (@mabmab71) April 6, 2022  The use of the word ‘team’ there is important, for Coventry as a club should not be a surprise for promotion. Yet their recent history has been anything but straightforward. Only half a decade ago, the Midlands club were in League Two. This time last year, they were still exiled in Birmingham, trapped in a stadium to which they return as visitors over the Easter weekend. It will be a stark reminder – not that it’s needed – of just how far Coventry have come in a short space of time. Promotion has looked an outside bet for a few months, but that is small fry compared to a fanbase having its club back. The progress is steady yet majestic. Two promotions in four years and a solid first season back in the Championship last time out have given great cause for celebration, and this campaign has had many magical moments. There is some sweetness to the fact that Coventry’s season of hope was bookended with fixtures against Nottingham Forest. The last-minute opening-day victory over Chris Hughton’s side showed this was a side with stardust in their boots before defeat to the same opponents this week effectively ended promotion hopes.  But when we all look back on this campaign, it is the spirit of the former which will bring many more memories to mind: the 98th-minute winner against Reading in August; Matty Godden’s November injury-time strike against Bristol City; two goals in the final five minutes to snatch a draw at Bournemouth; a 93rd-minute leveller at Huddersfield; another late winner away at Reading; a 1-0 win with the deadlock broken three minutes into injury-time at home to Barnsley; a late winner at Bristol City; and injury-time equalisers against Preston and Blackburn. It has all added up to an amazing season. That’s not even including the 4-1 home victory over Fulham back in October. In many ways, that never-say-die spirit exemplifies a club who have fought back from the brink to re-establish themselves in their city at a stadium that isn’t quite theirs. There are plans to find somewhere more suitable and beneficial than the Ricoh Arena in the medium to long-term, but the going is very good right now. Coventry have been far from perfect – snatching victories from the jaws of draws and points from the jaws of defeat is not sustainable – but this is a club that looked like not having a long-term future whatsoever at one stage. Next season, it is important that Coventry address some of the issues within the squad to continue their perennial progression over the last five seasons. Strikers Viktor Gyokeres and Godden have both reached double figures for goals, but no other Coventry player has scored more than three times. More defenders have reached that tally than midfielders, going some way to showing that beyond the front two, Coventry do not have attacking players on whom they can consistently rely. Godden has only managed to play 24 times due to a variety of injuries and lack of early form. Having a regular source of goals beyond the strike force is crucial in progressing further, while a deeper squad will be useful in plugging gaps or changing systems when the going gets rough on winless runs such as the current one. But all that matters little when taking into account that this season has been exactly what it should be for football fans: fun and with plenty of memories made along the way. For a fanbase who have suffered so much in the 21st century, the present and future are looking particularly bright for the Sky Blues. ",positive,liverpool,0
21,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-manchester-city-liverpool-guardiola-klopp-friendly-fire,Man City and Liverpool await face-off after friendly fire,"The rivalry between Manchester City and Liverpool – Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp – has a thread of friendly fire running through it. It seems aeons ago since Manchester City and Liverpool last initiated hostilities on the pitch. Their relationship has always been a rather distant one, compiling wins on a never-ending loop until – after trampling over everybody else – they face off to slap each other. Six months ago they produced pulsating drama at Anfield, sharing four goals in a game that had a manic, knockout tie quality to it. The fixture list now demands both come out and put on a Goliath versus Goliath Super Sunday and then do it all again with a Saturday matinee performance. There’s arms-length friendly fire respect between Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola, which isn’t the most enticing trailer for movie time. Very little energy is wasted on the build-up apart from the standard appreciation society. Neither manager expects the other to drop any points. Tick. Klopp always puts the favourites tag around the blues so that his rednecks can feel like the hunters. Tick. Pep tells us for the umpteenth time that Jurgen is the toughest opponent he has ever faced in his career. Tick. It’s all rather respectful if a little forced. The only time they broke into a spontaneous spat was when the German claimed his rivals had enjoyed a two-week break because of Covid. As Guardiola retorted at the time: “I thought Jurgen was not that kind of manager.” Gentle put-downs are as aggressive as it gets. The rest of the Premier League are craning their necks to see if they can get a glimpse of what might be happening up there in this rarefied air. The nerd stat being bandied about is that these two have taken a monumental 337 and 338 points from their last 144 matches. They are streets and interplanetary systems ahead of the rest. This is a proper premium rivalry. It just doesn’t have the historical edge that elicits cosy nostalgia. When Sir Alex Ferguson scoffed at Mark Hughes for suggesting the Manchester derby was the biggest school fight in town, he would have stopped clocks to prevent United not even being in the playground a few years later. Only once has the duopoly disappointed: when the two played out a shadow boxing goalless draw at Anfield in October 2018. That game was full of newly-formed mutual respect, driven by the experience of the helter-skelter style and intensity of Liverpool’s two most famous thrill-seeking wins. Pep, with furrowed brow and all, couldn’t stop worrying about that front three in those 4-3 and 3-0 losses. Something had to be tweaked to neuter the flying fortress of firepower. Klopp graduated from that base style where his team had to fight like “animals” just to get the ball. The last time the Reds went to the lion’s den in vital title race territory back in January 2019 they carried a seven-point lead which may have influenced a more conservative line-up. Sticking a half-fit James Milner into midfield alongside the workaholics Gini Wijnaldum (is he still not missed?) and Jordan Henderson didn’t quite work out. This autumn, Liverpool’s limited midfield was torn asunder again at times with Milner operating as a ragdoll full-back ripped to shreds by Phil Foden. Curtis Jones and Henderson struggled to shut doors as Foden, Rodri and Bernardo Silva flooded the not-so-watertight compartments. In the second half, Liverpool came roaring back with their “killers” as Gary Neville likes to describe them. Guardiola waxed lyrical: “What a game. That is the reason the last years Man City and Liverpool were always there because we try to play in this way.” It’s been 17 months since Liverpool saw the Etihad. Klopp went full metal jacket, throwing all four strikers onto the pitch from the off in a 1-1 draw. It worked for about 20 minutes before City managed to sort themselves out and then gain the ascendancy.  The overriding feeling of the last few years is that this match, especially at home, rests on Pep’s racket. Guardiola constantly talks about playing with personality. Results, although not secondary for one minute, will always be less important to his mantra: being themselves. City excel in finding the comfort of constant mesmeric rhythms which the opposition just can’t disrupt. He joked he was going to be clever against Atletico and play 12 men. Only overthinking and a courageous opponent can disturb the beats and lead to defeat. This Liverpool have now developed enough to change it up without relying on emergency Divock Origi mode. Their sophistication in-game will be curious to witness if things start to unravel on Sunday. They were the team with literally no substitutes in Kyiv four years ago. Now they have some aces to play to seize the day. As Klopp might say, this is “boom” or bust. ",positive,liverpool,8

The two heavyweights will lock horns at the Etihad in what has been billed as the ‘title decider’, with Liverpool just one point behind league leaders City as the season reaches its finale. Jurgen Klopp‘s men have won ten league games in a row and will feel confident going into the game, but a loss would be devastating with just seven games left to play. Pep has Klopp sussed – but Thiago can lift Liverpool Guardiola has sought to calm his side’s nerves ahead of the showdown by insisting that winning the title is not the be-all and end-all for City, who can simply “try again next year”. “What can happen?” he asked in an interview with Sky Sports. “Lose a game? And lose the Premier League title? Then we’ll just try again next year. “People say it, and it’s true – in life, there are more important things. I will be sad if we lose a game not being ourselves. But if we are who we are and the opponent can win – it’s ok. We are fortunate to live in this moment. Maybe I should feel the pressure now, but I don’t.” He continued:“When I was in my early years in Barcelona, I was more anxious about everything, more sensitive for everything. Now I handle situations a little bit more calmer. “I’ve learnt a lot at City. I’m a completely different manager and I feel I’m a better manager than when I started out because of the experiences.  “In Germany and Spain and now here, it’s been completely different challenges. I would say that that’s nice otherwise it would be so boring doing the same thing. “You can’t have the same ideas of 12 or 13 years ago, you become lazy, and you are not scared. You don’t have the intuition or the desire to think ‘oh, maybe we do it like that’ even though maybe it will be a mistake. “Always you have to make some evolution during the process. Evolution you do it to try to have success, yes – but especially, so you don’t get bored all the time doing the same at the end. “Life is about experiences and learning to improve different things.”   ",positive,liverpool,3

It was reported earlier this week that the Brazilian national team had identified Guardiola as their preferred successor to current boss Tite, who is set to step down from his position after the World Cup in Qatar. Guardiola has previously expressed his desire to manage a national team, saying at the start of the season:“The next step will be a national team, yes, if there’s a chance. I must have a break after seven years [at City], I need to stop to watch, learn from other players and maybe that is the road I will take. I would like to coach at the Euros, a Copa America, a World Cup.” The five biggest ‘title deciders’ in Premier League history However, prior to Sunday’s clash with Liverpool, Guardiola reiterated his commitment to City, before revealinghis confusion at reports of a £10m-a-year offer from Brazil. “I am under contract here. I am so happy here. Now is not the moment [to discuss the links]. I don’t know where that comes from,” he said in his pre-match press conference. Looking ahead to what could potentially be the Premier League title decider, Guardiola added: “It will be massive, and an important three points but if we win there will still be seven games remaining, 21 points to play for, and a lot of things involving the Champions League and FA Cups. “In the time I’ve been here both teams are the top two in the last five years. It’s been an incredible and marvellous contender. I said many times my opinion about Liverpool, how admired they are, Jurgen has been as a manager the biggest rival I’ve ever had in my career and I think what both teams propose, the way they play, is good for the football – we are ready for the challenge.  “We know we are going to defend parts of the game and sit back. Not because we want but [it’s] almost impossible [not to] for what they do. They make the pitch wider and higher, quality in the middle. Four, five years ago they were more direct, not too much between the lines. “Now they have a good build-up with Alisson, Matip, Thiago drops.

Current boss Tite recently revealed that he plans to leave his role following this winter’s World Cup in Qatar. Ten Hag realism should strengthen not weaken his Man United claim “I’m going until the end of the World Cup,” said Tite. “I have no reason to lie here. I don’t want to win any way. I’ve won everything in my career, the only thing missing is the World Cup.” Guardiola has been identified as the ideal man to succeed the 60-year-old, as per Marca (via Give Me Sport). The Brazil federation have reportedly started talking to Guardiola’s brother, Pere, and his representatives. They will offer the City boss a four-year deal until the 2026 World Cup, with a€12m per year salary. He reportedly earns€20m at the Etihad Stadium. Brazil have ‘great confidence’ they can convince Guardiola to accept the role. The Spaniard is under contract in Manchester until 2023. Guardiola has previously revealed his desire to step into international management, saying in 2018: “I would like to be an international manager in a national team. “Sooner or later, it will happen because every three days I would like to be involved, but a little bit more calm, play more golf…. now I do not have time to play. “So yes, sooner or later it is going to happen, if I have a chance and some international team wants to come ‘knock knock’ (at my door). We will see.” Meanwhile,Owen Hargreaves believes City star Phil Foden is the “most unique footballer” in the world following his instant impact from the bench in his side’s win over Atletico Madrid. The 21-year-old entered the fray in the 68th minute with the game goalless andbrilliantly set up Kevin De Bruyne moments later. “He’s able to do this as a false nine, as a right winger, as a No.10, as a deeper midfielder, he can play off the left. It’s hard enough to play at this level, he can play at a world-class level in four or five different positions,” Hargreaves said on BT Sport. “The thing is with Phil he’s one of one, he’s the most unique footballer around, When you see videos of him playing when he’s 10 he’s half the size of everyone else but now I think Phil’s still at the beginning of his development, I think there’s much more to come.” ",positive,liverpool,0

The Premier League club hosted Diego Simeone’s Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals on Tuesday. No ‘stupid tactics’, just brilliance from Pep and Phil As expected, Madrid made it tough for Man City for large portions as they frustrated Guardiola’s players. Phil Foden, Jack Grealish and Gabriel Jesus were brought on in the 68th minute. Foden’s introduction changed the complexion of the game. The midfielder played in Kevin De Bruyne with twenty minutes to go and the Belgium star finished off the move to make it 1-0. Man City hung onto their advantage so they will take a one-goal lead into next week’s return leg in Spain. After the win, Guardiola suggested that City “had chances to score a second and third” against Madrid: “We played an incredible top side who are difficult to face but it is a good result. We had chances to score a second and third,” Guardiola said (via BBC Sport). “The guys were playing well but we knew that Gabriel [Jesus] and Phil [Foden] have a special energy and Jack [Grealish] has the quality to keep the ball. Yeah, today the manager was so clever. “When we make a sub it is because we think it can be a bit better. It works sometimes but other times it doesn’t. “It is not easy to face a team with a lot of experience in this tournament. We will go there to score and try and win again.” De Bruyne added post-match that “it is very hard” competing against Atletico Madrid: “The first half was tight in the second half we had a couple of chances and it was good that we took one. “I made the run and Phil [Foden] found me perfectly, I needed to stay composed and luckily I did. It’s very hard. They played with almost five at the back and with five in midfield. I recommend anyone that says anything [about us], that they try playing against that on the training ground. “We have to stay composed and don’t try to get into their action. It is the way they play. One nil is one nil. I expect similar over there. If the game is tight they will have to attack a little bit more. On being ready for Liverpool this weekend: “It is five days until Sunday.

The truth is that Manchester City could barely have enjoyed much more possession had they fielded 12, 13 or 14 players, with Atletico Madrid happy to indulge in their most extreme incarnation of Sufferball, barely leaving the safety of their own half and ending 90 minutes with a shot so weak that some statisticians generously recorded it as a cross. It was ambitionlessasphyxiation and it was pure, undiluted Diego Simeone. For what felt like hours but was actually just 68 minutes, City patiently passed the ball forwards, backwards, sideways and then eventually to somebody on the right who inevitably tried to fizz it into the box but largely found the hands of Jan Oblak. There was little joy to be found in this repetition, nor in the many fruitless penalty appeals that punctuated a lengthy game of striker-less attack v defence. FAO whoever is in charge of naming tactics: this is the Knuckle Duster https://t.co/pU6KLsLPnD — Nick Miller (@NickMiller79) April 5, 2022 It had taken 55 minutes for Manchester City to muster a shot on target and 64 minutes to create a chance that should have been converted. In between, Atletico Madrid had made a triple substitution that had made no difference to the pattern of the game, only to the fatigue in the legs. On 68 minutes, Guardiola made his own triple substitution, not borne of over-thinking but simply of thinking that he needed to initiate change because every one of the 22 players on the pitch were locked into playing the same game in perpetuity. Off came Ilkay Gundogan, Riyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling and on came Gabriel Jesus, Phil Foden and Jack Grealish. Within a few seconds the latter had been fouled for the first of an astonishing five times in just 23 minutes; within 79 seconds the other English substitute had changed the game with his first touch. Perhaps Sterling would have wriggled away from four Atletico players; perhaps Mahrez would have played the slide-rule pass through to Kevin de Bruyne; but perhaps only Foden could have done both in that moment, unburdened by the frustration of what had come before. It was a moment of pure brilliance from a player whose genius has been normalised. And he is somehow still only 21. We are bound by journalistic codes to say that this tie is still ‘poised’ but it’s a damn sight less poised thanks to that goal from De Bruyne, created by Foden, unleashed less than two minutes before by Guardiola. The same coach who made no substitutions through a 90-minute stalemate with Crystal Palace made three in a Champions League quarter-final clash with Atletico Madrid at exactly the right time to punish a disciplined but inevitably tiring defence. This was the opposite of “stupid tactics”. Atletico will insist that losing 1-0 at the Etihad is not even close to a disaster but Guardiola should not worry himself with their perspective; he has wriggled his team into a half-time lead against obdurate opposition while simultaneously saving the legs of the brilliant Foden for Liverpool on Sunday. It sounds like he gave it just the right level of thought. ",positive,liverpool,1

Haaland is extremely likely to be on the move this summer when his£68m release clause becomes active in the summer transfer window. There have been many months of speculation surrounding where the Borussia Dortmund striker will end up with Man City recently emerging as the favourites to land him. Spurs > Man City and other 2022 Premier League stats Multiple reports last month suggested City were pulling away from the competition although one Spanish newspaper insisted that Haaland had turned downa ‘big offer’ of€600,000 a week (£500,000 a week). And now Spanish publication Nacional insists that Pep Guardiola has a ‘problem’ that could send Haaland ‘directly to Real Madrid or Barcelona’. They describe the possibility of a move to Man City as ‘very complicated’ despite appearing to be the big favourite to land the Norway international. Man City have everything to impress Haaland but the ‘enormous discontent that the arrival of the Borussia Dortmund star would cause’ could put the deal in jeopardy. Nacional claim that some of the Man City squad ‘would not be satisfied seeing a newcomer become the highest paid’ player at the club and it ‘might even threaten to leave’. ‘Bernardo Silva, Raheem Sterling, Riyad Mahrez, and especially Kevin de Bruyne’ are the ‘most prominent cases’ which could ‘cripple the operation’ to bring Haaland to the Etihad Stadium. Guardiola ‘will have to decide if it is worth jeopardising the good atmosphere in the locker room, just to bring Haaland’ while his injury record is apparently also a cause for concern. Speaking about the renewed speculation around Haaland to City, Guardiola said a couple of weeks ago: “Since I’m here, every month we are going to sign 50 players. Right now, it’s impossible I’m going to talk about some guys who aren’t here. Haaland is a Dortmund player. “You can ask for this player or another one. The transfer window is going to start and many things will happen. “Maybe I speak about this club needs a striker for the next 5, 6, 7 years maybe once in 12 months. I’m not going to be the guy with the success because we didn’t have a striker. “It’s important that if you play good, seven or eight players arrive in the box.

Gotze had his breakthrough season at Dortmund in 2010-11 under Jurgen Klopp before announcing himself on the international stage at the 2014 World Cup, bagging the winning goal as Germany lifted the title. He then moved to Bayern Munich for three seasons before returning to Dortmund, despite interest from his former manager Klopp at Liverpool. Pep has Klopp sussed – but Thiago can lift Liverpool Gotze, who is now playing for PSV in the Eredivisie, said this week that he “should have joined Liverpool” when he had the chance to. “We are still in touch and we spoke back then about me coming to Liverpool,” Gotze said in an interview with the Daily Mail. “But I wasn’t in a state of mind where I could consider it, that’s why it didn’t happen. “Do I regret it? It’s always difficult to look back but if you ask me now then yeah, I should have joined Liverpool for sure. I just made a wrong decision but it’s not a regret.” But Van der Gijp, who has been less than impressed with Gotze’s performances during his time in the Netherlands, claims Gotze would “never have played” for Liverpool. “I really thought that he had a very good image of himself,”Van der Gijp said onToday Inside (via MSN). “That he thinks: I will play in the Netherlands; I am only seventy per cent fit. And then I’ll be fine, against the NECs of this world. “But recently, I heard that he would rather have chosen Liverpool. Then I think: Yes, goddamn, you would never have played there, man. “With Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané. Then I think: Jesus, how can you say that?” Ahead of Liverpool’s match against Manchester City on Saturday,Klopp admits he would have been disappointed had his side not produced a response to the Citizen’s 14-point advantage at the top of the table. Klopp said: “The 100 percent truth is that what we did was normal. If we hadn’t tried I would be disappointed. “If you go into the season and the only thing you have is to win the league, then we are not that club, we can’t be that club because of City and the other teams (also wanting to win it). “So, not winning the league will be disappointing but there are other things to go for qualification for Champions League, other cup competitions, the Champions League. “There is a lot to go for and for those you need momentum and you need rhythm. Whatever situation you are in, come early January it’s a situation, so work from there and don’t suffer because of it. “If the gap is too big then close it – to one point. That was not about us, we just won the games but City didn’t win all their games. “That is what I expected from us. I don’t expect us to win all the games, but to try constantly and that’s what we did. “We knew it was 14 points but we didn’t care we just had to win as many points as possible until the end of the season that situation doesn’t change.”  ",positive,liverpool,9

The Egypt international has not scored from open play since February 19 and his last couple of performances, at home to Watford and away at Benfica on Tuesday, have been well below the standard expected of the 28-goal forward. Salah, who has experienced heartbreak at international level by losing the Africa Cup of Nations final and a World Cup play-off – both to Senegal – in the last two months, has looked like a player whose 47 appearances for club and country this season are catching up with him. Were he not who he is, with the record he has in the Premier League for the club, there would be considerable doubt over his place in Sunday’s team as he is arguably the least in-form of Klopp’s five forwards. However, dropping him against City is almost unthinkable because of the message it would send out before kick-off. “Yeah, big-game experience helps, definitely. It is not the only important thing you consider when you make a line-up but it is one of these,” said Klopp. The Reds boss had said after Tuesday’s win over Benfica that Salah, for whom speculation over a contract which expires next summer continues to grow, appeared to have been influenced by “stories” around him. However, he clarified that remark in his pre-match press conference by stressing he was referring to the talk about his workload and international disappointment, rather than any focus on his contractual issues. “I didn’t know about the stories behind it, it was the ‘stories’ what we thought about intensity – not the stories that were written,” he added. Liverpool head to the Etihad just a point behind City, having reeled in a 14-point deficit they had in January. Klopp’s career in Germany before he arrived at Anfield had been forged on his sides being over-achieving underdogs but his record since coming to England has shown they can equal the best. “Equal? I’m not sure,” he said. “The main difference between Borussia Dortmund/Bayern Munich and Liverpool/City is that at Dortmund we lost important players every year, Bayern never. “If you leave Bayern it is pretty much because you retire or finish your career or something like this or you don’t play at all. “If you played an outstanding season at Dortmund, there were a lot of clubs who could be interested and very often it was Bayern themselves. “That’s the difference in the situation, clearly. That’s why we could build here. We are much more equal at least than we were with Bayern. “We had last year which was not great (they finished 17 points behind City after a major defensive injury crisis) but even that we could build on because we knew why it happened. “I don’t care if we are equal but we are much closer than we were with Dortmund, that’s for sure.” ",positive,liverpool,3

The Premier League’s top two teams go head-to-head at the Etihad Stadium with just one point separating them heading into the last eight matches of the season. But a deeper dive into the statistics show that one-point gap also applies to their rivalry since the start of the 2018-19 season, when Liverpool finished runners-up – again by a single point – with a record 97-point tally for second place. Over 144 matches City have won 108, drawn 14 and lost 22, accruing 338 points. Liverpool have won 104, drawn 25 and lost just 15 times, making their total 337. The five biggest ‘title deciders’ in Premier League history “It’s great. I’m surprised about the numbers, to be honest. It’s massive,” said Klopp. “If somebody would have asked me four years ago – 2018 or whenever – do you think that’s possible and you are that close? I would have said, ‘Ah, not really’. “They wouldn’t have the points they have if we weren’t there and the same if the other way around. “We obviously pushed each other properly, that’s the truth. It’s nice. “Man City is considered the best football team in the world and they got one point more than us – what does that say? Exactly. “Obviously we did something right. I know that. I’m happy about that but it would be better if we had 20 points more in that period then we would have one more title or won more silverware. “It’s all fine how it is. That’s the basis we created, let’s go from there.” The fact Sunday’s match has taken on so much significance is due to the way Liverpool have reeled in City, who had a 14-point lead at one stage in January. Liverpool have won 10 successive Premier League matches, becoming the only club after City to achieve the feat five times. Klopp was asked whether seeing a 14-point advantage whittled down to just one put more pressure on City, and whether he would feel the same if the roles had been reversed. “I know it was 14 points but we had two games in hand, one was Leicester and the other Arsenal, although away at Arsenal is not a game where you can count the points directly in,” he added. “Would I (have felt the pressure)? I don’t know. I’m not sure if I’ve ever been 14 ahead and then all of a sudden only one, I don’t remember. “I wouldn’t imagine they will feel more under pressure. I can’t answer the question. We are not in the situation, I can’t remember being in that situation. “It’s not like I think, ‘Ah they’re under more pressure than us’. They play at home, they are calm as ice in most of the games that they play and we have to be as well. “Our programme is insane obviously. We play City, Benfica, City (in the FA Cup semi-final), (Manchester) United and Everton. “They will all hope if we win one of the City games that we celebrate for three or four days but we will not.” ",positive,liverpool,4

Sunday sees the top two sides face off at the Etihad Stadium where a win would take Klopp’s team two points clear with seven matches to play. The pair have been involved in some epic battles in recent seasons – in particular in 2018-19 when City pipped Liverpool to the title by a point despite a record points haul for the runners-up. Big Weekend: Man City v Liverpool, Lampard, Arsenal, Cornet While Klopp is not exactly overjoyed by the standards Pep Guardiola’s side have set he acknowledges they have made his players better, which contributed to them winning their first title for 30 years in 2019-20 with a 19-point advantage over City. “I wouldn’t say I’m thankful that City is that good but it didn’t deny our development,” said the Reds boss. “The last four years since we stepped up a little bit and could close the gap to City is interesting. “We pushed each other to incredible points tallies. Madness. I would have never thought these kind of things were possible, especially not in this league. “The consistency both teams showed in that period was absolutely crazy.” Liverpool have won 10 successive Premier League matches and have one foot in the Champions League semi-finals after Tuesday’s 3-1 win against Benfica in Portugal but Klopp said that was of no help for this weekend. “None of these games you compare. It is important but before none of these games we thought we will give them a proper one. Not United, not Everton, not Atletico,” he added. “There is no game in world football you can compare to play against City because they are good in pretty much all areas. There are no real weaknesses. “You have to show the respect they deserve, especially against City as they are pretty good with the ball. Jürgen Klopp expects to have everyone available for Sunday 👌 — Liverpool FC (@LFC) April 8, 2022  “We know it is tough. What’s changed this last four years is everyone else thinks it is tough when they face us, and that’s really good. “Nothing to worry about the mentality of my boys. After the (Benfica) game immediately the boys were clear – ‘now it’s City time’. We will be prepared.” Sunday’s game is being billed as a title decider but Klopp insists the race will be far from over whatever the outcome. ”I can’t decide what people think. But if you go through the possible results: if we win we are two points ahead and if everyone thinks that’s done and dusted with the league then I cannot help,” he said. “If we lose we are four points behind. And if anyone thinks, ‘that’s it’ then I cannot change it but I know no one from a City point of view would think like that. “If we draw it’s one point behind and that’s it. “It’s a very important game, one of the biggest challenges you can face in football and if we were 14 or 15 points behind, it would still be a great game.”  ",positive,liverpool,5

Haaland is extremely likely to be on the move this summer when his£68m release clause becomes active at the end of the season. Liverpool will give rivals hope and fear in equal measure There have been many months of speculation surrounding where the Borussia Dortmund striker will end up with Manchester City recently emerging as the favourites to land him. Multiple reports last month suggested City were pulling away from the competitionalthough one Spanish newspaper insisted that Haaland had turned downa ‘big offer’ of€600k (£500k) a week. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Liverpool and Manchester United have also been linked with the Norwegian international. However, Reds manager Klopp insists he will not try to bring the 21-year-old to Anfield in the summer transfer window. Klopp told Bild (via Fabrizio Romano): “No chance! We won’t be going there.

Meanwhile,Liverpool legend John Aldridge does not think Mohamed Salah should start against Manchester City this Sunday as “he is struggling” at the moment. Salah made a sensational start to this season and he has arguably been the Premier League’s best player in 2021/22. But his form has dipped in recent weeks. He has not scored from open play in the league since Liverpool hammered Leeds 6-0 on February 23. “If you are going by form, Mo would not get in the team. As great as he is and as much as we love him, he is struggling,” Aldridge toldSky Sports. “Now people might say that he has had his head turned, but he has got this contract situation, which does not help. He has not scored from open play for six weeks and he’s just not himself on the pitch. “I don’t know why that is. But come Sunday, if he is on the pitch, [Liverpool] need him like never before. It’s the biggest game of the season by far. Mo needs to be at his best. Hopefully that will happen but he’s struggling at the moment.” ",positive,liverpool,7

Konate had a mixed evening for the Reds, opening the scoring, but also being caught out playing too tight to the Benfica forwards on a couple of occasions. READ MORE: Liverpool will give rivals hope and fear in equal measure But Klopp was bemused by the assertion that the centre-back was following Everton around the pitch, insisting it “was not part of the game plan”. “You saw us man-marking? Then we played really bad. It’s only a possibility if Everton is always around Konate because we defend the space,” Klopp said. “I have to watch the game back, if it (he) did it then I have to make sure it doesn’t happen again because we play against the ball not Everton or the other boys. “It was not part of the game plan, not at all. I will watch the game back and if we man-marked him I will tell you before the second game. It’s not the plan, no.” Klopp admitted the game was more open than he wanted it to be. “Coming here and winning an away game in the Champions League is tough,” Klopp said. “Benfica fought for their lives, we gave them a little bit too much but they deserved the goal as well, even though we could have defended better – they had counter attacks, it is not easy to keep the ball all the time and the more risk you take, they have really good players. “It was a tough game, what I expected, the crowd was there, we knew 2-0 is nothing, nice but not more. They score the goal and it was much more open than we wanted but the goalie was probably the best player and made a couple of really good saves – we are two goals up, half-time, let’s keep going. “We usually score more [in those situations] but we didn’t, mainly because the goalie, credit to him, and that is pretty much the story. We could have scored in the last minute, 4-1 would be nice but we are not in dreamland here. “We know much more about our opponent, they won at Ajax, we are aware of the quality and have a nice game in between but then we will be ready again.” ",positive,liverpool,2

The interim boss would not be drawn on reports that Ten Haghad been lined up as the next permanent appointment at Old Trafford, saying his focus was purely on Saturday’s trip to relegation-battling Everton. Rangnick was also asked about his own future at the end of a week in which the Austrian Football Association denied having spoken to the 63-year-old about their vacant manager’s position, and said he would discuss his two-year consultancy contract at the end of the season. But asked if he would be offering thorough insight to the next manager, Rangnick said: “I have already done this, not to any managers, but inside the club. “I have told them how I see the current squad and what needs to happen in my opinion.

Ten Hag has been heavily linked with the managerial role at Old Trafford with current boss Ralf Rangnick stepping into a consultancy role this summer. Man United’s amazing plans to sign five starters for £20m The 52-year-old has enjoyed a terrific spell in charge of Ajax. He has guided them to two Eredivisie titles and two Dutch Cups. They also reached the Champions League semi-final in 2019 and were minutes away from making the final after Lucas Moura’s last-gasp strike took Tottenham through to take on Liverpool. It is no surprise that Ten Hag has been linked with Man Utd. A report earlier this week claimed the Red Devils were close to finalising his appointment. He has faced plenty of questions about the rumours and his employers are now fed up. As per Sky Sports News reporter Gary Cotterill, Ajax did not let any English media into Ten Hag’s pre-match press conference for this weekend’s match against Sparta Rotterdam. The Dutch club want their manager to focus on winning another league title. They are currently top, four points above PSV. Cotterill said (via Express): “As Ten Hag was preparing his team to face Sparta Rotterdam, the media team were busily rejecting the applications from the English media to attend the post-match news conference. There will be no radio, no newspapers, no Sky Sports News. “They don’t want him asked, in English, about Manchester United. His English isn’t that great, either.

Ajax boss Erik Ten Hag is the current favourite for the role having held talks with the United hierarchy last month. Gossip: Man Utd battle for £267m Premier League quartet United have been searching for a permanent boss ever since sacking Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in December and the next appointment is hugely important for the club. Another disappointing season for the Red Devils means it is now five consecutive seasons without a major trophy for the club and they are also in real danger of missing out on the top four this season. There have been reports of a number of dressing room unrest and that has led to Ferdinand admitting the most important thing that the next manager must sort out is the culture at the club. Speaking to BT Sport ahead of United’s clash with Everton, Ferdinand said: “Obsession, that’s the type of word Sir Alex Ferguson would put into the players’ heads. “Listen, I think Ten Hag, if he’s the guy that comes in and the rumours are that he might be, I don’t think there’s any candidate out there that’s been talked about that you think ‘he’s the guy, he’ll give us a great opportunity at challenging.’ “I think he’ll need support and the framework around him, in terms of recruitment and strategy, then he needs to provide the foundations for the framework around the team and the culture. “You look at Sir Alex Ferguson there and what he did, he built a culture over many years and had plenty of support in that time. “But, he built a culture, [and] managers nowadays have to do that much quicker. “You see with Pep [Guardiola] and Jurgen Klopp they can build a culture and implement that, but this manager will need that time and have to show the signs early on to get that.” Meanwhile, United defender Alex Telles has admitted he has thought about returning to former club, Porto. “I’m eternally grateful to the club and of course one day I think about going back there and continuing this cycle,” Telles said (quotes via Sport Witness). “It was a very happy period in my life. FC Porto is a love story. Of the clubs I’ve played, it’s the one with I most identified with, it was four years there. “I didn’t just identify with the club, I identified with the city and made many friends.

Literally any time Manchester United do anything these days, I find myself thinking of Michael Spicer’s “This is Manchester United Football Club” bit. Though better known for his ‘Room Next Door’ skits where a near-constant stream of source material from Tory MPs who are both cartoonishly stupid and evil has kept him busy since the start of the first lockdown, I still think the Manchester United bit is his most perceptive. Sure, the Room Next Door is a brilliantly clever idea expertly executed, but it’s also just a tiny bit too popular with the sort of person who considers words like ‘wankpuffin’ or ‘shitgibbon’ to be the very height of wit and who watches a Led By Donkeys Line of Duty parody and instead of cringing out a lung thinks ‘Haha! I’d like to see Boris wriggle out of this one!’. We’ve gone off topic. Manchester United, that’s what we’re here to talk about. Manchester United Football club. Man United. Anyway, in the Manchester United bit, Spicer plays a Generic Pundit whose entire assessment of goings on at Old Trafford is to just say “This is Manchester United Football Club we’re talking about” in increasingly exasperated and disbelieving tones. There is no actual analysis, just an implicit view that things shouldn’t be as they currently are, because it’s Manchester United. Every football pundit talking about Man Utd. pic.twitter.com/78Pnt5RJjl — Michael Spicer (@MrMichaelSpicer) November 2, 2019  It works so well because you hear real-life pundits do this all the time. Here’s the thing, though. It’s increasingly evident that it’s not just the lazy punditocracy that thinks this way. There are a lot of people around Manchester United who think the same way. That Manchester United should be successful purely because “This is Manchester United Football Club we’re talking about”. And there appears to be a widespread reluctance to talk honestly about where the club is and what is needed to make things right and how long that might take. United have already missed the chance to appoint Antonio Conte as manager, choosing not to pursue the available and willing Italian over a perception that he would ask the sort of awkward questions and make the sort of embarrassing fuss that you never got with nice, pliant, grateful Ole. Remember they didn’t want Antonio Conte because he’s not a “Manchester United type of manager” But Ole Solskjaer was.. — Mike (@Mike87_United) April 3, 2022  It looks like Manchester United are probably not definitely going to go for Erik ten Hag, but there’s an air of reluctance and suspicion emanating from the club about it all. Talk that he didn’t blow people away in interviews and most of all that he sees returning Manchester United to their ‘rightful’ place as a long-term project. Watching the toing and froing over the suitability of Ten Hag or Mauricio Pochettino over the last couple of weeks has been a reminder that 2022 Manchester United would have turned their noses up at 2015 Jurgen Klopp. Who is this clown who has had some success at a lesser league but is now coming in to a huge European giant of a club and insisting it might take a few years to make them great again? Begone, you bespectacled toothy fraud.  It’s faintly absurd to watch a club that handed the job to Solskjaer and left him to it for three years now be unconvinced by the merits of Conte, Ten Hag or Pochettino. The cult of United is a powerful one but the case of Liverpool under Klopp really is an instructive one. He was already one of the most highly regarded coaches in Europe when he took the Liverpool job. He is now considered undoubtedly one of the very best in the world. It took him three years to make Liverpool half-decent and another 12 months to make them great. There is nothing about United currently that suggests they have any reason to expect to be able to shortcut that process. You can debate for eternity about whether Ten Hag or Pochettino or Conte or whoever is or would be the best possible candidate for United, but you can’t pretend none of them are suitably qualified or experienced. Certainly not for a club that appointed Solskjaer on a current of vibes and nostalgia. Yes, United need to get this next appointment right whether that is Ten Hag or not. But a big part of that will mean accepting reality as it now exists: Manchester United may well finish seventh this season; they will almost certainly not be in the Champions League; they are a mile away from the current top two. Like Klopp at Liverpool, they will have to wade through some often disingenuous sh*t before they get to where they want to be. Even then they may not make it. But Ten Hag – if it is indeed to be him – will have to be backed and supported through those times. There is no silver bullet for Manchester United. There can be rapid improvement but there will not be an overnight transformation. Getting them back to the top is going to take time, and Ten Hag’s acknowledgement of this should strengthen not weaken his credentials. It shows he is aware of the job at hand and its scale. No manager is fixing this mess in a single summer, even if this is Manchester United Football Club we’re talking about. ",positive,liverpool,4

Man Utd ‘have finalised shortlists of potential targets ready to formally present to the new manager once he is in place’ with the report insisting that the Red Devils are ‘prioritising the recruitment of a striker and two accomplished, high-energy midfielders this summer’.

They went with Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer], who was the easy choice. “The brave choice would have been not to go with Ole because he had such a good time to start with as a caretaker. “So what I mean by this is he’s not managed at a big club and he is seen as this up-and-coming coach, ‘he’s new, he’s fresh’ and Pochettino’s not, he’s actually older than Pochettino, which some people don’t seem to actually know. “I don’t think he’s getting picked for the fact of just what he’s done for Ajax in terms of being successful because you expect that at Ajax. “But what they’ve done in the Champions League in terms of getting to the semi-final, how they play their football, their performance in the group stage this season.

The 25-year-old has been in and out the team at the King Power Stadium this season but has managed 21 Premier League starts, scoring an impressive eight goals and contributing four assists for his team-mates. Arsenal have been the main club interested in Maddison over the last year or two with many reports linking the former Norwich City star to the Emirates Stadium. A report last Sunday said that Leicester were ‘considering’ the sale of Maddison this summer in order to raise funds to strengthen their squad. The Foxes have failed to build on back-to-back fifth place finishes in the Premier League with Brendan Rodgers’ side currently sitting in tenth position. And a sale of Maddison would help them bring in reinforcements. The Sun now claim that Tottenham ‘are ready to battle bitter rivals’ Arsenal for Maddison in the summer transfer window with Leicester looking for a fee in the region of £60m. Spurs have ‘genuine interest’ after allowing Dele Alli to leave for Everton in January, while Giovani Lo Celso and Tanguy Ndombele also left on temporary deals. It is understood Antonio Conte ‘is a fan of Maddison and keen to increase his attacking options’ but a move could be dependent on Spurs being able to sell Lo Celso or Ndombele.  MBAPPE BLOW SEES REAL SWITCH TARGET Real Madrid are ready to renew their efforts to sign Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland, according to reports. Haaland is extremely likely to be on the move this summer when his£68m release clause becomes active in the summer transfer window. There have been many months of speculation surrounding where the Dortmund striker will end up with Man City recently emerging as the favourites to land him. His record of 80 goals in 84 appearances since moving to the Bundesliga side means most clubs in world football would be happy to have him and now the Daily Mirror claims that Real Madrid ‘have launched a new charm offensive’ to beat Man City to the signing of Haaland. It is believed that Real’s number one transfer target Kylian Mbappe is now more likely to stay at Paris Saint-Germain than pursue a move elsewhere. And the Daily Mirror adds that ‘losing out on Mbappe has prompted them to crank up their efforts to beat City to the Borussia Dortmund forward’s signature’ and Real Madrid know that Haaland ‘would favour a move to La Liga ahead of thePremier League’.  AND THE REST… Tottenhammanager Antonio Conte wants to sign a number 10 in the summer transfer window to allow Harry Kane to focus more on playing as a striker…Aston Villamanager Steven Gerrard is planning a big summer transfer window with as many as eight players for sale…Inter Milanare interested in re-signing Romelu Lukaku fromChelseathis summer – but only on a loan deal…Liverpoolare in the race to signTorino centre-back Gleison Bremer but face competition fromInter Milan…Manchester United’s hopes of signingLeicester City midfielder Youri Tielemans have received a boost, with potential rivals Liverpool and West Ham no longer interested in the 24-year-old.

Vardy has been sidelined since the start of last month due to a knee injury and remains unavailable for Sunday’s home Premier League game against Crystal Palace. Cheeky tips Liverpool and Everton wins, Raphinha to score Leicester, held 0-0 at home by PSV Eindhoven in the first leg of their Europa Conference League quarter-final on Thursday night, will play the third of eight matches scheduled for this month. Rodgers said: “Jamie won’t be back. He’s got a final injection on Tuesday and we’ll see what the reaction is to that. “He can do a lot of fitness work, we’re just not quite ready there on kicking the ball. So we’re hoping we get positive news next week on that.” Rodgers said there will be changes for Sunday’s clash with Palace. The Foxes will play the return leg against PSV in Holland next Thursday and then face a trip to Newcastle the following Sunday. “It’s the accumulation of games,” Rodgers said. “This month alone we’ve got eight games to fit in and I’ve said to the players the same team won’t play every game. “You can do, but you’re not going to get the same intensity and the energy that you would like. “The attitude of the players would always be first class, but the game is about energy, intensity, urgency, so for that, naturally, we would have to make changes.” Rodgers confirmed midfielder Nampalys Mendy and defender Caglar Soyuncu will both return to contention for Sunday’s match, while forward Ayoze Perez would be assessed after illness. Palace will be buoyed by Monday night’s 3-0 home win against Arsenal and Rodgers has been impressed by their progress under manager Patrick Vieira. Rodgers added: “Palace looks a really good fit for him. The team’s playing well, he looks to be enjoying it and he’s doing a fantastic job so far. “It was always going to be (a tough game) for us, despite the result against Arsenal. We’re on the back of a European game. “They’ve also got good physicality across their team and had a week to prepare.

The Foxes host PSV in the first leg of their Europa Conference League quarter-final on Thursday without Vardy. READ MORE: Burnley and Dyche will be missed by Premier League (ish) The striker has been sidelined for a month after suffering a knee injury in the 1-0 win over Leeds. Vardy is running again but is still struggling with the problem and Rodgers was downbeat regarding when he would be available. “It is hard to put a timeline on it,” he explained. “He is still feeling pain within the knee. He can run and he is outside, but when he is striking the ball there is an issue, so we will have to get to the bottom of that. “I just spoke to Jamie. He had been outside, running in straight lines. It was just when he was opening up the MCL (medial collateral ligament) a bit when he is striking the ball that he was getting some pain in that. “I will have to speak to the medical team to see where that is at, but it doesn’t sound as if he is too close to being back.” Danny Ward and Wilfred Ndidi (both knee) are also out, while Luke Thomas has shrugged off a hamstring injury. Timothy Castagne is likely to continue at left-back and the Belgium international is eyeing victory in the competition. The Foxes are 10th in the Premier League, 14 points off seventh place – a spot which could still offer European football next season. Winning the Conference League would send them back into the Europa League and Castagne wants to become the tournament’s maiden victors. He said: “We still have the Premier League, but why limit your options? It’s a big motivation. “It’s a possibility of a trophy which you never say no to. We’re very positive. “We know PSV have a lot of quality players and they play very well. They try to play football, not kick it long, but it can also play to our advantage, because if they take risks and if we press them we can take chances from that. We have to get the pressing right. “One or two legs, it doesn’t matter. We’ll try to win the first one and then the next one.

Premier League XI of players not at the 2022 World Cup He has now had surgery and he will not be fit to return until pre-season in a couple of months. “He’ll be out for the season which is a shame for us. He picked up a nasty injury which he had to have surgery on and he’ll recover for June,” Rodgers said. “He’ll get ready for next season. It’s a bit unfortunate, he’s been a brilliant player for me in my time here. On the other side, Papy Mendy has come in and been great. “We thought he was leaving in the summer, he wasn’t in the squad and then hardly played in the first half of the season. He has always been a brilliant professional and we gain a player in him.” Jonny Evans is fit for Saturday’s trip to former club Manchester United after a hamstring issue, along with Marc Albrighton. Luke Thomas is expected to miss out with a hamstring injury while Jamie Vardy (knee) and Danny Ward (knee) are unavailable. Leicester’s injuries this season have helped Rodgers change his mind on the introduction of extra substitutes and from next season clubs will be allowed to use five, the Premier League has announced. He added: “Certainly having experienced it I would be very much in favour of it. In the beginning I was one of the ones who was saying ‘let’s stay with three and see where we’re at and taking a look at it’. “Having looked at it over the course of the season, primarily for the health of the players, the five substitutions would work much better. “In European football having been able to make five has allowed us to take off players who were maybe suffering. “Especially in a season like it’s been for us this year I would have loved to have had an extra couple of subs to help a player recover.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Fofana marked what was his first appearance since breaking his leg in pre-season by scoring the goal that sent the Foxes through to the Europa Conference League quarter-finals. Was this the night that West Ham United finally came home? While Leicester were beaten in the last-16 second leg in Rennes, the 21-year-old’s header early in the second half of the 2-1 defeat saw them advance 3-2 on aggregate. They will now face PSV Eindhoven, with the winner to face Roma or Bodo/Glimt in the semis. Speaking to Premier League Productions ahead of Sunday’s home clash with Brentford, Rodgers said of Fofana: “Being out for such a long time, with a player of that quality and that mentality – he’s an elite young player who is going to develop into a top-class player – it’s always tempting to want to put him in, but we just have to be careful with him. “He’s a fantastic talent, but with the injury he has had, and especially with the recovery time being not so long in between…we’ll just gauge it over the next day or so.

You see his determination to get up and head it and score. “So, delighted to have him back, but we just have to assess him on a daily basis now.” Marc Albrighton (groin) and Wilfred Ndidi (knee) are also being assessed after being forced off by injury during Thursday’s contest, with Rodgers saying the latter “may have picked up an injury that might keep him out for a few weeks.” Caglar Soyuncu and Patson Daka did not travel to France due to feeling unwell – Soyuncu is expected to be fit to return on Sunday, but Daka looks set to be unavailable. Rodgers has also said that Jonny Evans is “close to being a part of the squad” and that Timothy Castagne is nearing involvement as well, after hamstring and thigh injuries respectively. Meanwhile, Jamie Vardy continues his recovery from a knee issue, and Rodgers said: “Hopefully Jamie should be back training with us within the next week or so, so that’s great news. “He may not be too far away after the international break.” ",positive,liverpool,0

It was a great atmosphere, our supporters were brilliant as well, we knew they would make a fast start and they got the early goal, but we showed a great mentality.” Wesley Fofana made his first start of the season after he broke his leg during a pre-season friendly against Villarreal.

The ex-Liverpool boss added: “It’s amazing, he has only been back training a few weeks. He was exceptional tonight and we have missed his determination.” Meanwhile,Leicester midfielder Youri Tielemans has spoken out on his future amid reports linking him with Manchester United.

However, after replacing German keeper Bernd Leno as Mikel Arteta’s first choice, Ramsdale has been in imperious form for the top four hopefuls. Calls for Ramsdale to replace Jordan Pickford as Gareth Southgate’s England number one have become more frequent with the Everton man struggling for the relegation candidates. Leicester boss Rodgers has backed those claims despite his heroics against his own side. “For me he’s the best English keeper at the moment. I think he’s top,” said Rodgers (quotes via talkSPORT). “His progression since he came to Arsenal, he’s playing for a huge club, different expectation with how to play football, I think he’s dealt with that really well. “It looks like he’s come into the club here, he’s playing now with a calmness. We saw him earlier this season and he was jumping about, but now he’s got a really nice calmness to his game. “He plays well with his feet, he makes saves, his save from Barnes looked in all the way, that was a great save and it kept Arsenal in front.” Elsewhere, former Hull City defender Ahmed Elmohamady has claimed his former teammate Harry Maguire doesn’t have the credentials to be Manchester United captain. Speaking to beIN Sports, Elmohamady said: “Harry was with me in Hull City and, in my opinion, he doesn’t have the level to be the Manchester United captain. “Man Utd need a player with a strong personality and I hope that the next manager will give the captaincy to Ronaldo if he stays. “Ronaldo can handle this responsibility and pressure; however, Maguire can’t handle this pressure. “So I think that the pressure he has by wearing the captain’s armband is affecting his performances. “Maguire performed really well with Leicester, a team that competes to be in the top six of the Premier League and maybe this is his level. “He doesn’t have the level to play for the biggest team in the history of England.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Father Joe Ricketts, who has no role at the Cubs or in the bid to buy Chelsea, branded Muslims “my enemy” in leaked emails from 2019. Chelsea fans have voiced concerns consistently on social media, and now the CST has added further weight to those worries. “At present, it is clear that our membership neither supports nor has confidence in the Ricketts family’s bid for the club,” read a CST statement. “This is reflective of wider concerns articulated by large, vocal sections of Chelsea’s supporter base. “The CST Board is guided by our membership, and thus we do not currently believe it is in the best interests of our members for the Ricketts family’s bid to succeed. “We await further public detail from the Ricketts family on concrete steps they will take to address the well-documented concerns of Chelsea supporters. “Should the Ricketts publicly set out clear and detailed plans on how they will address support concerns, we may survey our members again in the next week.” Tom Ricketts has built bridges with the Muslim community in Chicago ever since his father’s 2019 comments, and continues to apologise for his father’s comments. The Ricketts have been adding advisory partners in fine-tuning their bid ahead of the April 11 deadline for improved offers, but their bid is understood to be funded entirely by cash. Hedge fund supremo Ken Griffin has added his significant personal financial clout behind the Ricketts’ bid for Chelsea. Blues supporters continue to raise fears over the Ricketts’ candidacy to buy the club, however, with those issues crystallised in the CST survey. “Last week, the Chelsea Supporters’ Trust stated that the Ricketts family must urgently and publicly address supporter concerns – especially with regard to inclusivity, given both past and recent statements by members of the family,” read the CST statement. “We also committed to surveying our members as to their confidence and support in the Ricketts family’s bid for Chelsea FC. “Yesterday we conducted a snap survey of our membership. We asked our membership whether, based on information in the public domain as of April 1, they had confidence that the Ricketts family would run an inclusive and successful club, and we asked whether they supported the Ricketts family’s bid. “Our members have given a clear message in this regard: 72 per cent of those who responded do not currently have confidence that the Ricketts family would run an inclusive and successful club, with five per cent of respondents believing they would. “Similarly, 77 per cent of members who responded do not support the Ricketts family’s bid for Chelsea FC and three per cent of respondents are in support. “It is essential that the new owners of Chelsea FC have the confidence of the supporter base and demonstrate an understanding of the values that we stand for.” Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale on March 2, amid Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine.

Johnson believes he could have done “pretty well” at Chelsea, but claimed the numbers were “so enormous” that the party to take the helm faces a “huge challenge”. “My interest in Chelsea is I’m a fan of Chelsea,” Johnson said in a statement, reported by the New York Post. “When I was over there, I couldn’t be a fan of a particular team.

From a position of very little knowledge, having dug just slightly below the surface on these characters, we’ve come up with a fatuous ranking of the potential new Chelsea owners, from least likely to f*** things up to most likely. Thankfully the Saudi Media Goup have already been told that they are not among the preferred bidders. Again, we really have no idea. Think we’ve covered our backs now… Anyway, we start with ‘the good guys’… 6) Boehly/Wyss ConsortiumSwiss bilionaire Hansjorg Wyss was first off the blocks, revealing he had been offered Chelsea before the sanctions were even imposed on Roman Abramovich. Todd Boehly, Wyss’ partner in the consortium, isa man with a long-standing interest in Chelsea, having made a$3billion bid for the club back in 2019 that was rejected by Abramovich. He is also someone witha track record of success in terms of improving the performances and global appeal of his sports teams. When Todd Boehly was askedhow he would define a successful ownership of a team, having played a pivotal role in the rise of the LA Dodgers, in whom he owns a 20% stake, he replied: “You’re not really asking me that, are you? The more World Series we win, the more valuable a franchise it is, right?” The Wyss/Boehly Consortium is also consorting withJonathan Goldstein, CEO of investment firm Cain International, which sounds fine, but he’s a Tottenham fan and will undoubtedly double-cross the Blues and screw himself over for the good of the mighty Spurs.  5) Centricus Consortium With rumours of Manchester United’s interest in Thomas Tuchel and the possible departure of director Marina Granovskaia, the Centricus Consortium’s promise to “maintain existing management” played well to the masses. CentricusCEO Garth Ritchie and co-founder Nizar Al-Bassam are heading the bid, enlisting the help ofJonathan Lourie of Cheyne Capital and Bob Finch of Talis Capital. The four Chelsea season ticket holdersinsist they will invest personally, also promising that “the people supporting us have deep pockets of capital”, and are said to be keen to focus on redeveloping Stamford Bridge to move towards sustainable running of the club. It all sounds pretty good and they’ve also got a marvellously indirect tie with Chelsea.Lourie’s ex-wife Frida recently married Jamie Redknapp, who is – hello? – former Chelsea manager Frank Lampard’s cousin. Give them the keys.  4) Sir Martin Broughton and Lord Sebastian Coe Broughton and Co, sorry, Broughton and Coe, are the public faces likely to be looked upon fondly by the UK government, with the majority of theirfinancial partners keeping their involvement under wraps. Vivek Ranadive, an Indian-born tech mogul and owner of NBA team the Sacramento Kings, has spoken out in support, as haveJoshua Harris and David Blitzer, who both hold stakes in Crystal Palace.Harris and Blitzer would have to divest those stakes in order to pass the Premier League’s owners’ test, which could in turn delay the sale. Ex-British Airways chairman Broughton ushered in Fenway Sports Group to take over Liverpool during his short spell as the Reds chairman in 2010, and their success since makes him an attractive suitor. Coe’s experience in steeringLondon’s 2012 Olympics is another tick in the box for the government, as is his Conservative peership, obviously.  He’s a Chelsea fan who says he’s going to give fellow supporters a say in the boardroom and is desperate for the club not to fall into the hands of a lifelong Spurs fan. He would win a smarm-off hands down. But the way he’s scrabbled around for investment from multiple sources, reportedly adding to the bid after the Friday deadline, doesn’t scream prosperity for Chelsea Football Club. It’s absolutely not all about money, and if he comes good on giving the fans a proper say and can use his knowledge as a property developer to improve Stamford Bridge, that would be wonderful. But it is also quite a lot about money and they don’t have enough of it.  2) Woody Johnson Johnson has ‘said some pretty sexist, racist things’, a source told CNN. He asked prior to a Black History Month event in 2018 if the audience would be ‘a whole bunch of black people’ and described International Women’s Day as a ‘feminist event’. He sounds swell. He’s also overseen the decline of the New York Jets, leading fans to call for him to bring his near-two-decade-long ownership of the team to an end in 2017,with banners like ‘Dear Woody, sell the team’ displayed around the MetLife stadium.  1) The Ricketts family It may have just been me, but my impression of the Ricketts was clouded by their first statement of intent to buy Chelsea. They referred to themselves as ‘The Ricketts Family’ rather than ‘the Ricketts family’. Semantics, maybe, but it immediately conveyed a sense of entitlement – that they see themselves as a goddamn American institution ready to rescue this English soccer team. As patriarch Joe Ricketts’ racist emails re-emerged and #NoToRicketts trended on social media, Little Lord F*ckleroyTom Ricketts insisted his father deeply regretted saying ‘Muslims are my enemy’ and assured Chelsea fans the old geezer would have nothing to do with running the club. But apologies and assurances shouldn’t be enough for a club that, despite its many deplorable acts, has made a name for itself as a leader of inclusivity. As the elder of a fictional American family-run multinational might say: “F*ck off!  ",positive,liverpool,1

Blues owner Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale on March 2, amid Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine. The Russian-Israeli billionaire was then sanctioned by the UK Government on March 10, with Downing Street claiming to have proven his links to Vladimir Putin. The Blues must operate under strict Government licence, with Abramovich unable to profit from Chelsea’s sale. Every Premier League club’s worst signing of the season New York merchant bank the Raine Group is overseeing the sale process, with bidders continuing to wait to discover whether they have made the shortlist of candidates. Chelsea have been in good form while the ownership situation has been unfolding but Pulisic admits it will be “nice to have a break” with the US men’s national team before returning to finish the season. “It’s been a crazy situation, to be honest, but we’ve been able to focus on our game and just worry about playing over there,” said Pulisic, who is currently on international duty with the United States. “I’m just excited in general to come play with the US national team because I love this group of guys and I love this team and it’ll be nice to have a break, see something a bit different, and then I’ll be ready to go back and finish off the season strong.” Meanwhile, Muslim community leaders in Chicago have called on Chelsea fans to reject cancel culture and embrace “decent man” Tom Ricketts and his bid to buy the Blues. Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family are among the suitors locked in the bidding process to succeed Roman Abramovich as Chelsea owner. Family patriarch Joe Ricketts was accused of Islamophobia in 2019, calling Muslims “my enemy” in leaked emails. Chelsea fans have voiced their concerns via the social media hashtag ‘NoToRicketts’, while also raising issues with the club, though Joe Ricketts has no role at the Cubs nor in the bid to buy the Blues. BREAKING: The Ricketts family, owners of the Chicago Cubs, are flying to London as part of their bid to buy Chelsea Football Club 💰 pic.twitter.com/KGpwiXcOZh — Sky Sports News (@SkySportsNews) March 22, 2022  Ahmed Rehab from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has hailed Tom Ricketts’ response to the 2019 scandal, and has now urged Chelsea supporters not to write off the Cubs’ owner’s candidacy. Rehab explained how he met with the Cubs hierarchy in the wake of those 2019 leaked emails, and the steps the Chicago baseball side’s chiefs have taken since to prove their commitment to diversity and inclusion. “We became aware as everybody did about Joe Ricketts, the father, making some pretty problematic anti-Muslim statements,” Rehab told the PA news agency. “We were very offended, and immediately reached out to the Cubs at the time, Tom Ricketts and Julian Green, and they both responded. “They came to my office here in down town Chicago and we brought other Muslim organisations to the table for this meeting. “We were very clear and very stern in our rebuke of Joe Ricketts and his statements, and the association to the Cubs. “They distanced themselves, they apologised for the remarks, we went back and forth and we put together some concrete steps to show in action both the Cubs and the Ricketts family a genuine position on diversity and inclusiveness. “I’m not going to buy into this fad in the world of cancel and destroy on a mistake. If one persists with no regret on a mistake and doubles down, that’s a different story. “But if you’re someone who has made a mistake, and in this case it wasn’t even Tom; it was problematic but to be fair it was one step removed. “And then for that person to do all they can, do all the right things. We had expectations as to what the right things would be and that’s what they did.”  ",positive,liverpool,0
56,https://www.football365.com/news/man-utd-drop-ronaldo-wan-bissaka-arteta-arsenal-levy-tottenham,"Man Utd won’t improve unless they drop two players, Arteta out and…","Man Utd need to drop Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Cristiano Ronaldo if they want their attacking play to improve. Plus, Arteta out, Conte, Levy the genius and lots more… E-mail us your thoughts at theeditor@football365.com… Laughable United & Conte + Spurs praiseAs soon as Everton scored the first goal in the 1-0 win against United today, I knew that would be the winner. Everton simply got the goal they wanted and defended for their lives with 9-10 men in their own box since they are literally fighting for their lives in the league in avoidance of relegation. But how United couldn’t even score a single goal against Everton, who have been abysmal all season is simply laughable, but not surprising United have become a complete laughing stock. I didn’t watch the 2ndhalf due to expected disappointment once again, did the same for the Leicester game because the first half was rubbish, had a draw or loss all over it. Would also like to add that Rangnick probably can’t wait to leave as manager by the end of the season, he’s only taken the job because he has been offered a nice comfortable permanentconsultancy role for a further two years after his interim role. He isn’t fully responsible since he joined halfway through the season but fuck me he is boring bloke with such little charisma, and you can tell in his post-match interviews he is refusing to get emotionally involved, keeping himself to himself and waiting until the end of the season. He isn’t a coach AT all. Smart football man, but not a coach of manager at all. Drawn so many games in which we should have won this season (Burnley Away, Southampton at Home, Leicester at Home, Watford at Home). That is 8 points dropped and if United had won those games, would be 2 points ahead Spurs or tied with points with them if we had gotten 6 points instead. He probably looks at the United team and just thinks I must keep it safe due to a midfield of Fred & Matic and a defence of Maguire & AWB and how fragile the players are. Such a lack of personality with so many of them and half of the team are bang average and very lucky to be at the club. It’s not their fault in the sense they jumped at the chance of being provided an offer from the club in joining, but the bloody people in the board/club who thought they would be decent signings! I don’t know how involved Ole was in signing Maguire & AWB, but whoever made the call to signed for a combined amount of £135 million needs to be deported from England and banned from all footballing related jobs. I wouldn’t say this was the biggest mistake the club have made recently though in signings players like Maguire & AWB (Nearly forgot Fred too) but instead the decision to employ Rangnick as an Interim manager (2ndtime this has been done, Ole was the first) and NOT employ Antonio Conte as manager during that 3-4 week period (When Conte was unemployed) between Ole’s sacking and having Carrick in there in-between because no one else was there to manage. Why in the fuck would United think it was a better option to employ an interim manager for 5-6 months (Mind you Rangnick is 63 years old and has never managed at the BIGGEST stage which was proven in the two games against Athletico Madrid) rather than a manager who has managed Juventus, Italy, Chelsea & Inter Milan (Won 5 titles in last 10 years with clubs managed) and gets shit together at clubs relatively quickly. Of course the players aren’t going to improve or play seriously under a man of such little charisma, rather than a man you would actually be somewhat scared of and would want to play well for due to the passion and tactical awareness he has. I mentioned these points about Conte in my ‘Conte In, Pogba & Ole Out’article after the 5-0 defeat against Liverpool back at the end of October 2021 and I would like to think some of those points were valid and correct because look at Spurs now, they are FLYING. When you try and employ the best football manager out there who is actually available, this is what happens, results & performances start to take place slowly but surely due to the work on the training ground. Conte even had his doubts when he first joined Spurs, but he stuck to it, worked his ass off and made those players work their asses off. Kane, Son & Kulusevski (Underrated player by the way and suits the Premier League very well) are all flying and Conte has used these three players incredibly well and intelligently. He has probably seen the rest of the team as good but not great and will definitely ask the board for 2-3 further key signings in the summer, but so long as those current players do the basics and get the ball up to the front 3 ASAP, (Especially Kane who has been a monster of a player under Conte so far, he is essentially a number 10 & 9 at the same time), results will take place and Conte is doing this by playing to his teams strengths. It really sucks being a United fan right now, has been for the last few years even under Ole we weren’t a serious club and didn’t win a trophy under him. When Ten Haag comes in the summer and is even given some flexibility of who he can sign, good luck because you’re going to need it. The reputation of the club is as worse as I can remember, even worse than in the Moyes days towards the end of his reign. The club are simply a commercial driven joke of a football entity who can’t make any decent decisions and its toxic from the CEO’s & Board to the Players in that dressing room and Ten Haag is going to be right in the middle of that shitshow as Ole & Jose were. At this rate Ten Haag doesn’t have a chance to succeed and make United at least a Cup winning team.Rami, Manchester (Pogba going to leave for Free AGAIN, you can’t help but laugh)  If you play Wan Bissaka then you lose any impetus on the right. You neutralise your own right sided attacker as with no attacking support from the full back their options are limited to passing infield or trying to beat their man individually. That’s enormously easier to defend against than also having to keep an overlapping full back in mind. This constricts your attacking play in the center as defenders don’t have to cover potential attacks out wide and simplifies positioning and defending across the entire pitch as the defending team effectively have an extra man and a very restricted set of attacking options to worry about. Add to that a center forward in Ronaldo incapable of playing a role to help the team and who insists on dropping deep into the centre space that’s already compressed, both removing the option for Fernandes to find an attacker ahead to play off, and also duplicating the role played by Fernandes meaning no space for the playmaker, no ball for the playmaker and far fewer options for the playmaker and you have the turgid swill we just watched. It’s bloody annoying, Everton deserve to be relegated and Burnley don’t. I have massive sympathy for Rashford, Fernandes and particularly Sancho. Ronaldo and Wan Bissaka are lead boots to how those three want to play the game, and until United stop playing Ronaldo and Wan Bissaka they will never start forming the attacking connections between players needed. I really hope Liverpool stuff Blood Money Financial Doping FC on Sunday, and Fulham stuff Coventry beforehand because that was a really irritating start to the weekend.Tim Sutton (Man City are the Rishi Sunak of teams)  That sports psychologist that Manu hired really seems to be working out well…Adidasmufc(Even Jesus couldn’t save this lot)  Man Utd ruin everything…Damn this mediocre version of Man Utd, I was all in on this Partridge-like version of Frank Lampard we were getting. I was looking forward to the day when Everton got relegated and he got sacked and lost his “big name credentials” in the football manager field and he’d be having to gauge if football management is really for him in lieu of weighing up a Sky analyst contract or a ‘project’ at Hartlepool or Plymouth. I’ll not be able to imagine him running in his sports tracksuit barking “300k! 300k or we take it to Sky!” anymore. No synopsis of “the bitter life of a failed football manager turned radio Talksport presenter” to gloss over. This current Man Utd just suck all the joy out of football don’t they?Dave (Sad Panda), Dublin  Thank f$&k for that !!!TX Bill, EFC  Boring, sterile ArsenalThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Persisting with Laca as striker, playing Xhaka as left back, playing ESR and Martin in midfield are all tried and failed experiments. We’re going no where with Arteta as coach. #ArtetaOutKenneth, defeated In Dallas  Hi 365, As you know, I don’t like to gloat but…oh dear Arsenal fans. When will the Arteta delusion end? Quite the achievement blindly backing Pep’s mediocre janitor who spent more money than any team in Europe, playing just one game a week, out of the lot in February, but unable to lay a glove on blunt Brighton or score in a brothel. At this point, even Boris bloody Johnson has got more credible excuses for being s***t than Arsenal fans! Seriously, Vieira should have gotten that job. Clearly superior, way more coaching experience but hmm, can’t tell what the difference between him and Arteta is? 🤔 Three years, over £250m spent, turfed out your best striker, kept hold of a joker 5 years younger than Benzema but who plays like he’s twice his age! Hilarious. Guendouzi is scoring goals for France and a top midfielder in Ligue 1 – but apparently, can’t get minutes ahead of Lokonga or Nketiah. Saliba is also now a French international, suddenly. Arteta should have been sacked after his shitshow Europa League elimination last season; but Emery definitely needed to go eh? As he beats Bayern in the CL with a squad costing about one Granit Xhaka. Arteta is incapable of man-management, which is errrr, problematic when you’re tactically devoid of creativity. Comprehensively thrashed 5-0 on aggregate vs Palace and Seagulls in consecutive games, at the business end of the season. Even though Palace are involved in more competitions. Embarrassing. If any of the other 17 PL clubs outside Everton/Watford would swap your manager for Arteta, I’d love to hear from you!Stewie Griffin (Arteta cannot compete with Brighton coast oil money)  Right at end of the January transfer window, I questioned Edu and Arteta’s decision to strip the Arsenal team to the bare minimum by ordering a clear out. Now that Partey and Tierney are injured, the coach has no answer to the formation and the squad depth is exposed. Two straight losses to Crystal Palace and Brighton! I rest my case.Yiembe  Clever LevyWith Kulusevski proving himself to be one of the best attackers in the league and Diaz going off the boil, it is safe to say that Levy actually played Liverpool completely like fools – forcing them to swoop in for Diaz and then picking up the far superior player in Kulusevski in secret. The man is a genius.Rob, Dorset  Petro-Dollars & Man Utd Nice to see Minty’s meltdown in Friday’s mailbox.Newsflash Minty.Every single rich person and large corporation in the whole wide world makes a point of hiring super-smart accountants and lawyers to find sneaky ways to get around tax laws or, in the case of football, FFP.These tend not to be illegal but are most certainly unethical.I don’t condone it for a second.I repeat, I do NOT condone it.Nonetheless, I do wonder how many people reading this who suddenly won the lottery (for example) would end up, upon expert advice, not doing the very same thing.(See Jimmy Carr et al). Secondly, the complaint that City have squillions of pounds and, by extension, have a cheat code to win everything simply doesn’t hold water.If it did, then that logic would dictate that MCFC would be winning trebles or even Quads every season.But we all know that’s been far from the case. Look at PSG.Couldn’t even win their own domestic league with a cast of superstars and they have squillions of petro-dollars.Look at Man Utd.The so-called ‘biggest club in the world’ (not for much longer).Rich as Croesus and what have they won recently?Where are they now, seventh in the table? If simply having the most money equated to instant, and even guaranteed continuous success, then you would have a point.But it doesn’t.Which is why Leicester winning the PL (magnificent) as did Liverpool, as well as the CL, deserved as they all were proves otherwise. Anfield has a strategy that unites the whole club behind its manager, players, and staff.So does the Etihad.This is why both are twenty-odd points ahead of Man Utd. And this is something I think a lot of United fans simply don’t get.It literally doesn’t matter who your next manager is.He is not the problem.United have, possibly, the worst recruitment history of the PL in the last ten years.And by that I include their choice of CEO, the absence of any credible DoF and their continued instance on buying shiny players that the current manager neither wanted nor asked for. Apart from blind faith, what evidence do you have that your club owners will do anything differently now than in the last ten years?Mark (Honourable mention to the Scouser trying to get his excuses in first about Manchester Refs.Really not sure you’ll need to worry about that Our Kid).MCFC  Falling into the Sky trap…Lee’s email shows how people in this country have fallen into the trap that Sky have set us all. The Premier League is fantastically successful across the globe. But in England, most of us simply don’t revere Barcelona and Real in the way that they’re revered elsewhere in the world. And only one club in England comes close to that sort of reverence from the rest of the world. They do play in red, but they’re from another city in the north-west. That said, remember Ferguson saying he wouldn’t sell Real a virus, let alone Ronaldo…about 6 months before actually having to do it, because once they come calling… The same thing happened with Suarez. Footballers simply want to play for these sides because they are bigger than any other club.Aidan, EFC, London (still processing today’s early kick-off…good grief)  Season predictions are useless It’s been said by many a pundit, it’s better to have the 3 points than the game in hand, or 2 games in hand. This is playing out before our very eyes with Arsenal. More often than not, the game in hand is against lower opposition. So for example, nobody out there will consider having a game in hand when the game is against Man City. So when fans talk about “a game in hand” they usually expect their team will win said game and gain advantage.Which is what Arsenal had, they had at one point 3 games in hand. How a team that isn’t in the champions league, or uefa missed to play 3 games over teams that had 2 play 2 games a week is worth investigating, but at some point this season, Arsenal had 3 games over either Spurs or Man U. As we speak , they have a game in hand over Spurs but are 3 points behindthem, with a poorer goal record. So even if they win their remaining game in hand, they will still be below spurs. I can only remember Man U using games in hand to usurp Liverpool around 2008/9 , but more often than not, things don’t pan out as expected. So I do wonder, is it better to have played Norwich, win, drawn, lost and know where you stand on the table, or have a game in hand. against Norwich? Classic definition of “a bird in hand, is worth 2 in the bush”. Spurs may have done better than Arsenal with their game in hand. The one positive I can see are the likes of Man U who gave up way too early. If Man U had kept true, won against Leicester and Everton, instead of limping through the rest of the season, that’s +6 , which according to the table, put them level on points with Spurs with a poorer goal difference record. So basically , we’d have 2 teams playing for the title, 3 place sealed, and 3 teams vying for fourth based on goal difference at this point. Maybe there twists and turns still left, but the above scenario would have been great to watch.Dave(Man City will smash Liverpool), Somewhere  ",positive,liverpool,6
57,https://www.football365.com/news/southampton-0-6-chelsea-tuchels-side-run-riot-at-st-marys,Southampton 0-6 Chelsea: Tuchel’s side run riot at St Mary’s,"Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea responded to recent defeats in emphatic fashion as they hammered Southampton 6-0 at St Mary’s. Timo Werner struck the woodwork three times but he was still able to net a brace. Mason Mount also grabbed two goals. Marcos Alonso and Kai Havertz added to their advantage as Chelsea ran riot. Where Lukaku ranks among the 14 Chelsea strikers since Drogba Chelsea’s fourth win in their last five Premier League matches inched the Blues ever closer to a third-place finish, with London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham starting to lag behind in the table. Boss Thomas Tuchel revealed a sleepless Wednesday night binging on chocolate in re-watching Chelsea’s 3-1 Champions League quarter-final loss to Real Madrid. Chelsea held summit talks on Thursday in a bid to hit back after leaking seven goals in two matches, given the Blues’ 4-1 home reverse to Brentford last Saturday. Tuchel admitted he did most of the speaking in a tough-love talking-to for his players, and on this evidence that mix of meeting-room candour and late-night candy has paid immediate dividends. Chelsea’s German coach insisted the Blues’ Champions League chances were all but over after that first-leg loss to Real. The Blues will at least now head to the Bernabeu Stadium on Tuesday night buoyed up by a victory as bullish as it was bullying on the south coast. Southampton slumped to their fifth defeat in six matches in all competitions, with their last win the 3-1 FA Cup victory over West Ham on March 2. Saints’ third-heaviest loss under Hasenhuttl, after the much-documented 9-0 humiliations at the hands of Leicester and Manchester United, crystallised a wretched run of form. Chelsea were so dominant so early in this clash as to be playing keep-ball with little more than half an hour on the clock. Werner struck the left post on a quick break to open the afternoon, before inexplicably heading against the bar from point-blank range. The pacy forward had the goal at his mercy after Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s fine cross took Fraser Forster out of the equation, but somehow managed to scoop the ball upwards and onto the crossbar. Alonso’s drilled finish through traffic after Mount’s cross alleviated any Chelsea nerves however. Deadlock duly dismissed, the Blues ran Saints ragged. Not content with teeing up the opener, Mount quickly fired home himself – requiring just one touch to steady himself and another to hit the corner of the goal from 20 yards. Southampton’s day plumbed further depths when the usually ultra-reliable captain James Ward-Prowse unwittingly provided an assist for Werner. Ward-Prowse’s back-header gifted Werner a clear run on goal and this time the Germany star kept his cool, rounded Forster and slotted home. The Blues were not finished either, with Werner reverting to type to complete that unwanted treble by striking the right post – allowing Havertz to tap into the unguarded net. Chelsea took that 4-0 lead into the break, whereupon Havertz was replaced by Christian Pulisic. Werner tapped into an empty net to open the second half, profiting after N’Golo Kante’s cute chip was only parried by Forster. Mount then quickly swept in after a six-yard box scramble to put the Blues 6-0 up comfortably inside the hour. Chelsea coasted out the rest of the contest, providing the perfect riposte and offering perhaps just a glimmer of hope for next week’s trip to Madrid. ",positive,liverpool,0
58,https://www.football365.com/news/alex-keble-man-city-v-liverpool-tactical-preview-klopp-guardiola-thiago,Pep has Klopp sussed – but Thiago can lift Liverpool,"Pep Guardiola has shown himself to be smarter than Jurgen Klopp – but Liverpool have an ace up their sleeve when they go to Man City. Here’s Alex Keble’s preview of a potential title-decider… The perception of this fixture is one of equals battling it out at the pinnacle of the sport, and although there is a case to be made that Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City and Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool are indeed the two greatest club sides of all time, recent history does not support the notion this is an even contest. Man City have lost just one of their last eight games against Liverpool. In fact, save for a flurry of Liverpool wins in the first few months of 2018 – a 4-3 in the Premier League and wins in both legs of a Champions League quarter-final – Guardiola has consistently understood how to get the better of his rival. He has beaten Klopp by three or more goals on three occasions, most recently in February last year, while their only meeting since – a 2-2 draw at Anfield – could easily have been another thrashing. For the first 30 minutes of the game Man City completely dominated, swarming Liverpool and pinning them back, only for some costly misses to allow the hosts to build back into the game. As is increasingly the case in this fixture, Guardiola tactically out-witted Klopp. First, he successfully targeted the weak point, right-back James Milner, by getting false nine Jack Grealish to double up with Phil Foden. He also had his team press relentlessly onto the Liverpool midfield, forcing them to give possession away cheaply, which was helped by Liverpool’s desire to play lots of long balls in behind the defensive line – stretching their formation to leave gaps for City to exploit.  An XI of players who killed Treble or Quadruple hopes  Liverpool were ultimately able to ride it out and, thanks mainly to Mohamed Salah’s genius, take a point. But they cannot afford another slow start, and it is time Klopp bites back with a strategy that takes Guardiola by surprise because, though it hasn’t had cut through yet, the Man City manager seems to have cracked it. The consistent trick is to cram the no.10 space with bodies – which the Liverpool midfield have not historically been equipped to handle – and use a wide back three to build out down the wings, bypassing Liverpool’s forwards. Klopp is unlikely to do anything substantially different, mind, again using a 4-3-3 and – as always against City – instructing his players to hit long and high passes behind the City defence to set his wide forwards away. There is certainly a chance this could work, especially down Salah’s side should Joao Cancelo leave his traditional zone to become an extra man in central midfield. The recovery pace of Kyle Walker, forming a back three for most of this game, will be very important. But the main cause for Liverpool optimism is the existence of Thiago Alcantara, injured for the game in October but set for his second game against Man City on Sunday. In his first, he was substituted in the 68th minute with the score at 1-1. City went on to score another three goals.  Thiago remains an under-rated player, even now. There is nobody more important to what Liverpool do. His ridiculous technical ability, his capacity to read the game and play line-splitting passes that nobody else can see, and his composure when under pressure makes him the metronome of Klopp’s system. He keeps Liverpool on the ball and camped in the opposition half, and whenever things start to slip he is there to take control, weave clear, and create order out of chaos. It is no coincidence Liverpool have won all 12 league games in which Thiago has started this season. His presence at the Etihad, coupled with Trent Alexander-Arnold’s return to patch up the right flank, should ensure we have a more even game.  Thiago’s battle with Kevin de Bruyne could prove decisive. They will largely occupy the same half-space as the match swings from end to end, with Man City likely to indulge in counter-attacks should one of Liverpool’s breaks come to nothing; Guardiola normally tells his team to recycle possession in order to regain their structure, but for a couple of years now he has changed his tactics for Liverpool matches. He knows Klopp’s side are most vulnerable when stretched by one of their own counters. Much rests on the configuration of Liverpool’s front three. Rodri can be left a little exposed on his own at the base of midfield as Guardiola’s two eights roam forward, and although the City manager is generally more cautious against Liverpool – sometimes using a double pivot – Liverpool are still best advised to play Roberto Firmino, who can drop into gaps around Rodri. However, Klopp may be tempted to start Sadio Mane, Salah, and Luis Diaz together for pure pace. That would certainly produce a more chaotic game, theoretically favouring the visitors.  That’s about all we can say in a tactical preview of Man City v Liverpool, because an awful lot of what will happen depends on in-game changes from the two coaches – and nobody can predict those. From subtle tweaks to formation changes to triple substitutions, everything is on the table as both Klopp and Guardiola react and counter-react to one another. In that 4-1 a year ago, it was Guardiola’s second-half switch to a 4-4-2, with two false nines, that changed the rhythm of the game. No-one saw that coming. And so, there’s little use in trying to predict what will unfold this time. Sunday’s game is a meeting of two geniuses at the peak of their powers. Mere mortals cannot tell you what will happen.

59,https://www.football365.com/news/liverpool-forward-salah-remains-coy-on-sensitive-contract-situation,Liverpool forward Salah remains coy on ‘sensitive’ contract situation,"Mohamed Salah is refusing to be drawn into speculation about his Liverpool future as his side seek a historic quadruple this season. The Egyptian forward is out of contract at the end of next season and it remains unclear if he will sign a contract extension. The five biggest ‘title deciders’ in Premier League history He has been terrific for the Reds since moving to Anfield from AS Roma for £37million in 2017. Salah has scored 153 goals for the Premier League side, including 28 in 38 appearances across all competitions this term. When asked what he can reveal about his contract situation, Salah told Sky Sports: “Well not much but honestly, but what I can say is there many things people don’t know about it. “I can’t be selfish and talk about my situation. We are in the most important period for the team so I have to just talk about the team, focus on what is coming with the team and that is the most important thing. “That is all I can say. Hopefully we are going to be more optimistic and see what is going to happen.” When asked if he was confident about signing a new deal, he added: “I can’t say yes, I can’t say no but I have said many times before about what I want. But again, I can’t go deep into my contract now because it is a really sensitive situation. “The team need to win and I can’t be just going into the news and just talking about my contract. I just focus with the team, and that is it.” Liverpool face Manchester City on Sunday in what could be described as a title decider. They are also still in the Champions League and FA Cup after winning the Carabao Cup in February. This has set up the possibility of an unprecedented quadruple. Jurgen Klopp will need Salah to be on top form for this to become a reality. And the Egypt international insists his performances will not be affected by the talk around his Liverpool future. “No, not at all,” he said when asked if he will be affected negatively on the pitch. “I’ve talked with the manager from time to time and I’m very professional, I know my job very well. “I’m almost the first one here and the last one to leave. I know what I am doing. So, I am not bothered about that. I am just focussing on the team. That is the most important thing for me. “I’m focused to win trophies and I am giving everything to the club that I can.” ",positive,liverpool,3

Watch some Saturday football and then e-mail us at theeditor@football365.com Why would Salah want to leave Liverpool? Now maybe this email is premature but every day it looks more and more like Salah won’t sign a new contract. For the record I think he’s worth the new contract. At first we were told that the club couldn’t afford the money he was asking for. Then they found the money. Next we were told it was the length of contract because we don’t offer long term contracts to people over 30. Then they offered him 3 years plus an optional 4th. Only two weeks ago both the club and Salah said things were progressing well, now suddenly a day before the biggest game of the season Salah says it’s a “sensitive situation”. We’ve seen this before. Macca did it back in the season before he left and Barca offered us 11m for him but he insisted he would sign a new contract and told us not to accept it. Then he didn’t and he left for free to go to Madrid. Then Michael Owen said he was definitely gonna sign a new contract too, Rafa came in took one look and said sell now because he definitely isn’t signing. And he went to Madrid. Is history repeating itself? It seems that way, since yet again the player/agent is insisting they want to stay while simultaneously rejecting the offer even when he’s allegedly been offered what he wants. My question is this – why would Salah want to leave? He’s loved in Liverpool. Successful in Liverpool winning almost every club trophy there is. He’s trusted by the manager to the point that even when he should probably be dropped he still starts and it’s not as if any Premier League football player needs the money. To an extent I can understand why past players wanted to leave. Other clubs were a greater chance of success. That’s not the case anymore. Is it really just that north west weather is shit and Madrid is quite nice? Someone should have a week-long coaching session with the players but instead of tactics or fitness etc all they do is watch videos of recent players who left Liverpool. They can watch Emre can get discarded by Juve, Coutinho get discarded by Barca, they can watch Suarez get….actually he did pretty good but then Suarez is a machine. They can watch Gini get booed by his own fans and struggle in a league which is supposedly easier in a team which is supposedly vastly superior. Suarez aside all these players left Liverpool to go to a “big European club” and “win trophies” and none of them did at the club they chose to move to. They all got paid more money than at Liverpool but ultimately were moved off the books by their first choice. Honestly, and maybe it’s just the red tinted glasses, but I can’t fathom why a trusted, well paid, starting member of the first team of a club who compete for and win trophies regularly would want to leave right now. Especially to go to Barca or Madrid, two teams which will be going through a rebuild and likely not compete outside of Spain for a few years.Lee  Hyped for Man City v Liverpool So here we are, almost at the Premier League title-deciding game of the season, that has been built up for a little while now since Liverpool started eroding back Man City’s lead. As Big Weekend said, this is of course not a title decider, certainly not if Liverpool take the points. If Man City do win then maybe it will turn out to be the decider in their favour as we already know, they are tough to catch and a four-point lead might just knock the stuffing out of us a little bit after the huge effort to get it back to a single point. As a Liverpool fan I am unbelievably hyped/apprehensive about this game. We are on a fantastic run of form, not conceding a goal in the first half of any game for 26 games now, defensively strong even if we give the ‘look’ of being open. Does feel like since we battered Leeds that we have been playing in second gear. We will need to raise those levels on Sunday for sure. Man City can hammer any team at any moment, but they can also lose at any moment. We might need all our defensive resilience of recent weeks and be clinical on the counter, like Spurs were a few weeks ago. Whatever happens, hope there is no controversy with the Manchester-based officials that we are all talking about come Monday morning. Here’s hoping for a high-quality game between the best sides in the country.Kevin  …Sitting in a small town in India, thousands of miles away still i can’t sleep, eat or work properly. Exited and very nervous at the same time. Can’t wait for the huge game this weekend. Only football can do this to you.Dharam  …Genuine question to mailbox, does this Pep-Klopp library is the best in sporting terms? The way both us and city play, the consistency of last 4-5 years and also between City-Liverpool, there have been some genuinely great attacking matches. Ferguson-Wenger had the invincibles but United’s success was more down to Ferguson’s ruthlessness against the other 17 teams apart from top 4. The great man knew how to win championships. Mourinho-Guardiola (La Liga) was a clash of styles. Can the mailbox find any other rivalries in football where the teams actually became better on the pitch?  In response to Ted Bythesea’s mail, the issue is not the player or league but the club that brought Lukaku. If Lukaku was indeed a hot property, which other club was bidding for him last summer? As with Serie A, Romero to some extent and Alisson to a large extent have been qualified successes. And if the issue is with attackers, then Fernando Llorente at Swansea and a certain Mo Salah for us haven’t been bad either. Plus Kulusevski has hit the ground running.Vikas, LFC, India (F365 mailbox – Best fans in the world)  Already bored by this nonsense… Am I the only one expecting a very tight game between City and Liverpool to be decided in City’s favour by a questionable VAR decision, made by 2 officials who are based in Manchester?Shiraz, Johannesburg  📭 F365 ‘MAILBOX LIVE’ – 8th Apr 2022 https://t.co/kqkn9Hj9VU — Football365 (@F365) April 8, 2022  More on Friday’s Mailbox Two points I want to reply to from the mailbox. 1. Mané and Salah playing shite? They are probably fatigued since they’ve played the whole AFCON, travelled back to Liverpool, played Premier league games, travelled again to play World Cup qualifiers, then back to Liverpool for premier league and then to Portugal to play Benfica. I’d imagine a normal person would be wrecked from the travelling alone, never mind throwing in the guts of 14 games 10 weeks. Yes they are professionals but they are also human. 2. Strikers from Italy. Does Ted not remember Lukaku tearing it up for WBA, Everton and, yes, even United before “coming from Italy”?Culk the Younger  …Two words for Ted Bythesea: Mo SalahRich  I think you forgot Mo Salah, he hasn’t done too badly.Neil, LFC, USA   Remember when Chelsea went down? Surely the shiniest example of ‘too good to go down’ was Chelsea in 1988? They didn’t even finish in the bottom three but lost a play-off to Boro and were consequently relegated. I can’t honestly think of a worse way of being relegated as I don’t think this experiment has been repeated in any other season.Graham Simons, Gooner, Norf London  On that famous Toon atmosphereSt James Park is far and and away my favourite ground, great aesthetics and generally neat and tidy. Was a nice change for away fans to be welcomed in and around the town centre. Locals were friendly and we only got turned away from one pub, but that was polite with suggestions of nearby ones we could go to. What was surprising was the amount of police presence. We had been assured beforehand that we would be welcomed, and that turned out to be true so am not sure why there was such a heavy police presence – is this normal at Newcastle matches? 140 steps for the away fans – Jesus that was tough but worth it for the view from the top. Great stadium shit fans – seriously. Where was your famous atmosphere? No singing, just a bit of flag waving until you finally took the lead. Very disappointing. To the match and other disappointments. Wolves were beyond poor, by far their worst performance this season. So negative, no inspiration, no movement just dire. Fault must lie with Lage for this, it appeared he set up and told his players to go for a draw, which they nearly did thanks to Newcastle being nearly as bad. The penalty was 50/50 in my opinion. Having seen it back a few times the contact was barely there. However Sa gave the referee a decision to make and he made it. A deserved result but a half decent team would have put six past Wolves. The fact Wolves are still within a sniff of Europe makes it even worse that they failed to turn up to an entirely winnable game. Question for the mailbox – what has been your biggest disappointment in terms of atmospheres at away games? I really expected an evening of back and forth amongst the Newcastle fans but it just didn’t happen. Any others out there?Sara – HTFC but loves a Wolves season ticket holder  ShadenLampard?

Liverpool face Manchester City on Sunday as they look to go above their title rivals. A win for Jurgen Klopp’s side at the Etihad would put them in a great position to reclaim the title. The five biggest ‘title deciders’ in Premier League history They are also well placed in the Champions League after securing a 3-1 win at Benfica in the quarter-finals first-leg on Tuesday. Having already won the Carabao Cup earlier this year, they will also be hoping to add the FA Cup to their collection. They face Pep Guardiola’s side at Wembley next weekend in the semi-final’s. Although Salah’s form has dipped in recent weeks, his overall performances this season have been crucial for Klopp’s side and ahead of this weekend’s crunch clash, the Egyptian has urged his teammates to enjoy the situation. Speaking to Liverpoolfc.com, Salah said: “We’ve never done four before. This season we are really close and we are in top form. “We’ve won the last 10 games in the Premier League so we are in a good way, and hopefully we can win the next game. “We look at this situation now and we just have to enjoy it. We can’t be in this situation and feel pressure. We just have to enjoy it and go for everything.” “They are a point ahead and play at home. I think that gives them more of an advantage. “However, we are experienced players now and we’ve played together for four or five years. We know how to play big games. “Hopefully we will win the next game but if you ask me about advantage, they have more of an advantage because they are a point ahead and are at home. “The most important thing for us is not to lose the game, but if we lose the gap is going to be bigger. “The manager talked to us today and just said enjoy the moment and just go for it.” ",positive,liverpool,3

Pep Guardiola’s side are top of the table but have seen their 13-point lead over Liverpool reduced to a point after the Reds won ten league games in a row. On Sunday, the two sides will lock horns at the Etihad in what has been billed as the title decider. Carragher is anticipating a 1-1 draw, but fears that if City win, then there will be no catching them.If Liverpool win, on the other hand, then Carragher believes that City would still be in with a chance. The five biggest ‘title deciders’ in Premier League history “I think it’ll be a draw, that’s not sitting on the fence, I just think the teams are so evenly matched and that a draw wouldn’t be the end of the world for either team in some ways,” Carragher said on the Sky Sports Football podcast. “If it’s level with 10 or 15 minutes to go, it’ll be interesting to see what the managers do, whether they go for it or settle for a point. “Both teams, if it finished as a draw, I think would say ‘okay, we’ve got seven games to go here’.The first game was a draw, both teams are so evenly matched, City have a slight advantage being at home but it’s going to be a 1-1 draw for me.” He continued: “I think it’ll decide the title more if City win – I don’t think it will if Liverpool won. Four points with seven games to go is a big lead. “These two teams notoriously win games week after week. There’s still a way to go, no doubt, but if City were to win I think they’d have to throw it away with how long there is left.”  On where the game will be won and lost, he added: “I think it will be won in midfield. “Man City, no doubt, have the edge in terms of quality, and in every other area I think Liverpool have the edge but we talk about big games, how important that part of the pitch is, and certainly at Anfield, Manchester City dominated the first half when they were at their best. “Liverpool came into it, knew they had to improve, and City then ended up salvaging something late on. I think Ruben Dias being out is a big blow for Man City, he’s a fantastic player, and their closest thing to Van Dijk in some ways, a real leader at the back.”   ",positive,liverpool,6

Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola have taken the Reds and the Citizens to new levels with the two sides separated by a single point over the past four seasons put together. Man City have 338 points from 144 Premier League matches, while Liverpool have 337 points from exactly the same amount of games.

65,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-crystal-palace-3-0-arsenal-sleep-din-top-four-race,F365 says: Arsenal sleep through the din at Palace,"Arsenal were back to their very worst, at the worst possible time. They must forget, but Palace will be reliving this one for a while… ‘It’s just not clear what the plan is. The Arsenal players don’t seem to know what to do.’ ‘Crystal Palace were just better. Better on the ball; better off the ball.’ What was true in October was also true in April. The reverse fixture saw Arsenal claim a late point, but they came away from Selhurst Park with nothing on Mondayand deserved less than that. It’s anothing that could be very costly in their hunt for a place in the top four. It was a night to forget for Mikel Arteta’s side, who were overawed by the raucous crowd, outfought and outclassed by their opponents. Arsenal offered nothing in the first half. Martin Odegaard was bad, Thomas Partey was awful, Nuno Tavares was worse, but picking out individuals is cruel – they were all absolutely terrible. It was Arsenal at their most Arsenaly – weak, rudderless, bullied. They fell so far short of their excellent performance levels of recent weeks. Arteta looked livid throughout. Jean-Philippe Mateta spent the game tormenting each member of the Arsenal back four in turn, beating one for pace, the next for strength, and so on. Wilfried Zaha was genuinely laughing at Cedric Soares’ attempts to defend him in the first half. Gabriel and Tavares combined to take a share of the blame for the two opening goals. Gabriel misread the flight of Conor Gallagher’s free-kick as Tavares weirdly ducked to allow Joachim Andersen to climb over him to inadvertently assist Mateta. Gabriel then dashed out of defence to cut out Andersen’s through ball for Jordan Ayew, while Taveres failed to track the goalscorer’s run. Palace swarmed all over Arsenal in the first 30 minutes. Gallagher was everywhere once again, but Ayew, Zaha and Mateta all played their part in a high press to which Arsenal had no answer. The Arsenal passing at the back and into midfield was nervy and frequently poorly weighted or misplaced. While last season Palace were not a team set up to test or take advantage of defensive sloppiness, they are now among the best around. They didn’t give Arsenal a moment’s peace. Arsenal were a lot better in the second half, but that was more an illustration of just how bad they were in the first rather than an indication that they were actually that good. They had chances and should have scored, but as Eddie Nketiah’s fine curling effort came back off the corner of post and bar, it felt like they never would. It was right that Zaha put the game soundly to bed (though the Palace fans will be up for a while) – winning, then emphatically converting a penalty. Having robbed Partey in midfield – who was by that point actually injured rather than just playing like he was – Zaha beat Gabriel with one touch, ran into the penalty area with a couple of stepovers, diddled three Arsenal defenders, before having his legs swiped from under him by Odegaard. Back in October I wrote: ‘It was the sort of game that will have Arsenal fans wondering whether they would prefer Patrick Vieira in their dugout to Arteta.’ And while doubts over Arteta at Arsenal have been replaced by praise and excitement in the main, with the Spaniard implementing a style of football that’s working with the young players he has at his disposal, nofans in the Premier League will be more excited by their manager than the Holmesdale lads and lasses. Arsenal have come a long way this season under Arteta, but not as far as Palace under Vieira. Arsenal will have plenty of wounds to lick after this defeat. It’s the manner rather than defeat itself that could prove to be most damaging. With the relative lack of experience in the squad and coaching staff compared to Tottenham, and given that Antonio Conte’s side appear to be hitting their straps at the right time, Arsenal’snext two games against Brighton and Southampton are massive ahead of what promises to be a very tasty north London derby. They must forget a night at Selhurst Park that’s joined a long list of memorable ones for the Palace fans this season.  ",positive,liverpool,0
66,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-ten-best-premier-league-signings-ronaldo-chelsea?utm_source=Recirculation&utm_medium=WP_Related_Articles_Unit&utm_campaign=Benchmark,Top ten best Premier League signings of the season,"It does feel a little bit like Chelsea did some silly things in the summer when you compile a list of the ten best signings of the season. 10) Christian Eriksen (Brentford) Despite only playing 12.9% of Brentford’s Premier League games this season, Christian Eriksen has started a third of their wins. He has helped galvanise the Bees and guide them from genuine relegation trouble to the comfort of mid-table purgatory, lifting the mood as well as the quality. A goal and an assist barely scratch the surface of the Dane’s impact. But no amount of sentimental arithmetic is required to justify his inclusion, nor claims such as those made by Thomas Frank, who suggested even before Eriksen’s Brentford debut that he could be “potentially the greatest signing” in the club’s history. It is a truly remarkable story, life-affirming in every sense.  9) Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United) It helped eradicate the reasonable foundations upon which Manchester United were slowly building season upon season. It exacerbated the underlying culture of finger-pointing and blame deflection. It aggravated the growing divides in an increasingly fractured dressing room. It contributed to the professional demise of a manager he described as ‘an outstanding human being’. It exposed the fragile masculinity of an entire super club’s ego at immense expense. But Cristiano Ronaldo has scored loads. Only three players have done so more in the Premier League this season. The campaign is coming to an end and it was far from an easy one, despite his 18 goals – the rest of the Manchester United podium is made up by players on nine and six – scored in all competitions.  8) Craig Dawson (West Ham) In the time since Watford loaned West Ham defensive cover in the form of Craig Dawson – to the jubilation of most connected to Vicarage Road – the Hornets have gone down, come back up and are currently on course to slide into the Championship once more. The 31-year-old had been relegated at the end of his previous two Premier League seasons before linking up with David Moyes, who identified a solid and reliable centre-half when others saw a limited harbinger of potential top-flight doom. By April of last year, the Hammers made it expressly clear that Dawson would be joining on a permanent basis. He has carried on precisely where he left off in terms of consistency and quiet imperiousness, even taking a career-first European campaign in his stride. West Ham signed two central defenders last summer and not only is Dawson roughly as good as his regular partner at one-fifteenth of the price, he also hasn’t yet been revealed to abuse his pets.   7) Tino Livramento (Southampton) The fee itself seems to be on some sort of sliding scale, anywhere between £25m to £38m, reduced from £50m due to clauses that stipulate Chelsea are due some of the profit from Tino Livramento’s next move. But the buy-back option the Blues insisted upon when selling the right-back to Southampton seems destined to be cited extensively over the next two seasons or so. The only question is whether someone else gets there first and locks down their right-back position for the next decade. It is entertaining to see Chelsea start Cesar Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso as their full-backs, considering Livramento and Tariq Lamptey were sold to Premier League clubs for a combined £10m within the last couple of years. The former has followed a similar trajectory to the latter, leaving Stamford Bridge for more playing opportunities and immediately transforming from highly rated academy graduate with no senior experience to regular top-flight starter courted and admired by a rapidly expanding gaggle of clubs. Southampton was the perfect choice in many ways: Ralph Hasenhuttl is a tremendous coach; their style of play is expansive enough for an adventurous defender with an insatiable work ethic to stand out; and Saints have shown countless times that when the moment comes, they will not stand in the way of a player who feels ready to take the next step. There are few better places to develop before moving on with your stock exponentially improved. St Mary’s is the ideal place for Livramento right now.  6) Cristian Romero (Tottenham) Five players featured at centre-half in a Premier League game for Tottenham last season. Eric Dier, Toby Alderweireld, Davinson Sanchez, Joe Rodon and Ben Davies took turns in forming the crux of a defence that could not afford a viable platform for a teammate who led both the goalscoring and assist providing charts for the campaign. The departure of elder statesmen Alderweireld, one year after kindred spirit Jan Vertonghen’s own sale, necessitated the biggest change in the club’s backline for at least half a decade. The onus fell on Cristian Romero to raise the standards closer to the daunting height of his Belgian predecessors. The 23-year-old channels the passing range and composure of Alderweireld, blending that with Vertonghen’s assurance in bringing the ball forward. But Romero brings his own attributes to the table, namely an unmatched aggression, intrinsic physicality and ability to read the game clearly. He has been far from faultless but then it is worth considering what he is being asked to do in terms of leading an often slapdash defence as one of its youngest components and a new signing to a notoriously difficult league.  5) Emmanuel Dennis (Watford) Watford might yet slip into the shallow abyss, ready to resurface at the next available opportunity, but Emmanuel Dennis has surely done enough to skip the relegation chapter and sustain himself on a regular top-flight diet. Interest from Villarreal is both understandable and likely only the genesis of a possible auction for his services, even if that rhythmic flow of goals in the winter has stalled since the appointment of Roy Hodgson. Nine for the season, with five assists, is a better combined total than Kevin de Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and Sadio Mane. Dennis does not discriminate against opponents either. He has scored against as many teams in the top half as the bottom, while those goals have come in five wins and four defeats. The numbers produced in a relegation-battling team under three vastly different managers underline the 24-year-old’s versatility and durability. And that is even before mentioning he has at least three more nutmegs than any other player across Europe’s top five leagues. What a menace.  4) Aaron Ramsdale (Arsenal) In terms of exceeding expectations, Aaron Ramsdale would be this season’s runaway leader and a probable contender for one of the best Premier League signings ever. His pursuit was supposedly emblematic of a misguided and haphazard transfer philosophy at Arsenal, a frivolous purchase of a perennially relegated back-up when such lavish funds were better focused elsewhere in the squad, a quota-filling acceptance of rank mediocrity from a broken club. Jamie O’Hara bellowed loudest during the chorus of criticism, at which point the world ought to have realised it was probably a decent move. Ramsdale has given Arsenal a stability and seriousness they had lacked for years between the sticks, emitting an air of confidence that has permeated through the defence and energised the rest of the team. It only works in games against sides other than Manchester City, Liverpool or Crystal Palace but that is still most of them. Alisson and Ederson are the only shot-stoppers – a reductive second mention considering Ramsdale’s excellence on the ball –with more clean sheets this season, fitting considering he is certainly among the best of the rest outside the established leading two.  3) Conor Gallagher (Crystal Palace) When used properly and not as a surreptitious means to hoard as many players as humanly possible, the loan market can be an incredibly effective way to help a player evolve and mature. In many cases with a club of comparable size to Chelsea, it is an option overlooked by managers who prefer to work personally with potential first-teamers to ensure their specific tactical ideals are imparted directly, rather than having those waters muddied and confused by a different coach with a completely contrasting approach for a season. But sending players out temporarily to further their progression is a proven practice, provided the short-term destination is chosen carefully. Thomas Tuchel could not have designed a better holding area than Crystal Palace, a team discovering its exciting new identity after years of enforced but necessary stagnation, nor a more suitable interim custodian than former midfield general Patrick Vieira. Conor Gallagher is thriving at Selhurst Park with the Frenchman’s guiding hand, offering Chelsea hope of a bright future when they most need it.  2) Jose Sa (Wolves) The departure of Rui Patricio seemed potentially ruinous for Wolves, such was their initial position as punchers in this relationship when the Portuguese signed upon promotion in summer 2018. The club’s previous regular starting goalkeeper in the Premier League had been Wayne Hennessey so a European Championship winner with almost 100 international caps and substantial experience in continental competition was as close as they were going to get to securing that presence of mind without bringing the Welshman back to Molineux. But Patricio’s exit for Roma, especially when coinciding with Nuno Espirito Santo’s farewell, warranted a changing of the guard. Bruno Lage has been an inspired hire and Jose Sa perhaps an even bigger upgrade in his position. He has the highest save percentage of any Premier League goalkeeper this season, emphasising the “massive impact” Gary Neville recently said Sa had had at Wolves since joining. That performance against Leeds was bloody weird but to sell and replace a guaranteed starter in any position is difficult enough; improving your goalkeeper at almost half the price as the one you’re letting go is transfer witchcraft.  1) Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace) Perhaps it is a coincidence that the worst performance of this Crystal Palace season came in the only game Marc Guehi missed. Tottenham eased past the Eagles on Boxing Day as Joachim Andersen and James Tomkins struggled and Wilfried Zaha was sent off. Vieira missed a game that Covid-hit Palace forlornly tried to have postponed despite making a solitary change to the starting line-up from their previous match. Andersen for Guehi was the one alteration. Chelsea only possess the option to match any bid on a defender they sold for £18m in the summer; whether they have the facilities to rival what would surely be a monstrous bid is another matter. But it is funny to see their current mild panic over another position they voluntarily weakened. And in any event, Guehi and Palace seem understandably enamoured with one another, while the occasional captain has more than four years left on his contract. That will not stop clubs from trying to pry him away from south-east London as a defender with no discernible weakness continues to shine in his first season of senior top-flight football. He really shouldn’t be this good, particularly when you consider he has played 2,610 Premier League minutes this season and the only five other centre-halves under the age of 22 to feature (Andrew Omobamidele, Charlie Cresswell, Wesley Fofana, Nathan Collins and Jarrad Branthwaite) have 1,568 between them.

The German lost his status as first choice at the Emirates Stadium following the signing of Aaron Ramsdale last summer. Injury to his colleague has now offered the 30-year-old a route back into the side and Arteta says it is down to him to make the most of it. Arsenal, Arteta should tell Neville to go fourth and multiply Leno kept a clean sheet as Arsenal beat Aston Villa last time out and, with Ramsdale still troubled by a hip problem, he looks set to continue against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Monday. Arteta said: “This is football and it’s not an individual sport. I have a lot of sympathy with every player that doesn’t play and doesn’t get the chances they probably deserve but unfortunately that’s the game. “When he’s been playing for 10 years that meant someone has been there waiting for that opportunity. MATCHDAY 🙌 🕗 8.00pm (UK) 🏟 Selhurst Park 🆚 Crystal Palace 🏆 Premier League #CRYARS pic.twitter.com/L6WborJ18b — Arsenal (@Arsenal) April 4, 2022 “What you want to have is, in every position, players that are reliable and can perform, whether they’ve been playing recently or not. In the goalkeeping position it’s no different. “That is why we bought Aaron, to get the standards higher, to bring different qualities, different ways of understanding and acting during matches, and different experiences. “With Bernd we have the capacity to play him (on Monday) and we know what we’re going to get. “He’s done a very similar thing to Cedric (Soares) and Nico (Pepe) – not accepting the situation, but trying to improve it. “And then he’s been consistent in the way he trained, the way he behaved, in those months, waiting for the opportunity and, when he had it, to take it.” Arteta recognises it can be difficult for a player to accept a reduced status having seen it many times during his own playing career.  The Spaniard, who spent 11 years in the Premier League with Everton and Arsenal, admits he only appreciates the bigger picture now because he is a coach. He said: “I can give you hundreds of examples. When you start to get to 30, 31 and 32 it’s going to happen, I guarantee it’s going to happen at some stage in your career. “But if it is that late I think it’s a good sign, that means you’ve been pretty consistent because it can happen much earlier. “It’s never easy to accept for a player but we want the best, so if we make a decision to play somebody else it’s because we believe in that moment it’s better for the team to play somebody else. That’s it. “There is not a personal thing in that decision at all and it cannot be taken personally. “I didn’t play when I was younger, you never understand the reason. They can explain to you but you will never understand, you’ll never agree to it. “That’s normal but when you’re on the other side of the table the picture changes completely.” Arsenal have recovered from a poor start to the season to put themselves in a strong position to claim a Champions League place. Correspondingly, expectations may have changed but Arteta feels no need to change anything now. He said: “This is a conversation we have had now for over six to eight weeks, so they have already been through that and have responded really, really well. There is nothing new that they have to do.”  ",positive,liverpool,0

Including the current No.1 stopper. These are the keepers who have been called up to a senior England squad since David Seaman’s final international appearance against Macedonia in October 2002… 24) Scott Loach – 0 caps The friendly against Hungary in 2010 marked a nadir in England goalkeeping. While Joe Hart manned the sticks, his back-up was Watford keeper Loach and Frankie Fielding. Loach amassed 14 Under-21 caps but his career nosedived shortly after leaving Vicarage Road as his ‘dream move’ to Ipswich turned sour. The 33-year-old has been flitting around the National League for the last five years.  23) Joe Lewis – 0 caps Lewis had 46 appearances in League Two, spread over spells at Stockport, Morecambe and Peterborough, when he got the call from Fabio Capello in May 2008. The 6ft 5in keeper sat on the bench for both friendlies against USA and Trinidad & Tobago but was never seen again on the senior scene. After it turned sour for Lewis at Posh, he went to sit on Cardiff’s bench before finally finding a home in the Aberdeen goal following spells at Blackpool and Fulham.  22) Frankie Fielding – 0 caps Fielding, aged 22, was fourth-choice keeper at Blackburn behind Paul Robinson, Jason Brown and Mark Bunn when he was called up from the Under-21s by Capello in 2010 to be a substitute against Hungary. His first Under-21 start had come only the night before and Stuart Pearce admitted he had been “lightly raced, in terms of matches”. His last professional appearance prior to sitting on England’s bench at Wembley was on loan at Rochdale the previous season in front of fewer than 5,000. He made up the numbers in two subsequent senior squads and never played for Blackburn in the Premier League before moving to Derby then on to Bristol City. Then on to Millwall. Then Stoke. Who loaned him to Salford for a week last Thursday.  21) Marcus Bettinelli – 0 caps The then-Fulham keeper was in two England squads in the first half of the 2018/19 season. He has played only one Premier League game since the second of those call-ups and currently serves as Chelsea’s third choice.  20) Angus Gunn – 0 caps ‘He might be good, he might be brilliant. Ask us again in five years,’ we wrote in the first iteration of this article in 2018. Four years on, we’re still not sure but the Norwich stand-in is certainly a lot closer to ‘good’ than ‘brilliant’. Still uncapped.  The 36 players who wish they were one-cap wonders  19) David Stockdale – 0 caps Thegoalkeeper, pundit, businessman, philanthropisthad eight Premier League appearances behind him as Fulham’s No.2 when Capello called upon him for a friendly against Denmark in February 2011. Stockdale had to turn down a squad place against Switzerland that summer because he wisely identified that getting married was a smarter long-term move, rather than watch a Euros qualifier against Switzerland from the bench or the stand. He made six subsequent squads while on loan at Ipswich, getting on the bench on four occasions.  18)Alex McCarthy – 1 cap The Reading stopper was called up by Roy Hodgson in 2013 and Sam Allardyce in 2016 before finally being handed a cap by Gareth Southgate in 2018. McCarthy would presumably be back in this week’s squad if weren’t for injury, with his Saints stand-in Fraser Forster back in the fold instead.  17) Chris Kirkland – 1 cap The then-Liverpool loanee netted his dad £10,000 when he made his England debut in 2006, but, despite being described by David Platt as the “best young goalkeeper in the world” and Sven-Goran Eriksson as the “future of English goalkeeping”, it was to be hisone and only senior cap. Kirkland spoke out about his battle with depression that ultimately ended his career at Bury aged 35.  16) Scott Carson – 4 capsThe then-Liverpool keeper, another one, was first called up by Eriksson in 2005 but his international career is best remembered for a dreadful mistake after being picked over Paul Robinson when Steve McClaren’s England lost to Croatia in a must-win World Cup qualifier in 2007.Two sub appearances followed under Fabio Capello but the City third-choice was just one of a long line of keepers who never looked at home in the England goal.  15)Ian Walker – 4 caps More than eight years separated Walker’s first and last caps, with only two coming between. His only competitive appearance came as a late replacement for Seaman when Gianfranco Zola’s volley beat Glenn Hoddle’s England in a World Cup ’98 qualifier. The then-Tottenham stopper watched European Championships in 1996 and 2004 with his involvement in the tournament in Portugal coming after a season in Leicester’s net that saw the Foxes suffer relegation. Lovely hair.  14)John Ruddy – 1 cap Ruddy received his first call-up in Hodgson’s 23-man party for Euro 2012 but the then-Norwich keeper broke his finger in training prior to the tournament and was forced to pull out. To add insult to injury, it was Ruddy’s first broken bone, on his ring finger, just a few days before his wedding. He made a belated debut in a friendly against Italy shortly after the European Championships but remained a one-cap wonder, despite lurking around Hodgson’s squad for two more years.  13) Sam Johnstone – 3 caps The West Brom keeper has yet to concede a goal for England though two of his three caps came against Andorra. A consistent presence in the squad for the last year but never likely to trouble those with genuine ambitions of taking or retaining the No.1 spot.  12) Fraser Forster – 6 caps ‘At 30, he looks finished at international level,’ we wrote four years ago. How wrong we were. Six years after his last cap, Forster is set to be on the bench against Ivory Coast after every other fit English keeper went down with illness or a knack of some kind.  11) Dean Henderson – 1 cap Henderson had his eye on the starting spot for the Euros last year but everything that could go wrong pretty much did. He lost the battle for the gloves at Old Trafford, even if David De Gea auditioned no better, and though he made Southgate’s squad, he had to withdraw through injury. Then he caught Covid and little has been seen of him since while De Gea cruises to Man Utd’s Player of the Season award again.  10) Tom Heaton – 3 caps The Man Utd back-up was around Hodgson’s England squad for 18 months before finally seeing some action in a pre-Euro 2016 warm-up against Australia. Heaton has played two halves under Southgate, conceding four goals against Spain and France, before injury ruined his World Cup hopes and allowed Pope to get comfy in his gloves.  9) Aaron Ramsdale – 1 cap The Gunners’ gobby goalie is a No.1 in waiting according to many, particularly those with an Arsenal leaning. Few would argue that he hasn’t been the best English keeper in the Premier League this season but Ramsdale, capped once in a 10-0 win, still has a fight ahead of him to usurp Pickford, whom Southgate seems to trust. A genuine contender to challenge for the gloves.  8)Jack Butland – 9 caps Back in 2018, it seemed to be a straight fight between Butland and Jordan Pickford for the No.1 spot at the World Cup. Pickford won a battle from which Butland seemed never to recover. He spent the following two years in the Championship while Pickford prospered before being offered a Premier League lifeline as Crystal Palace’s No.2.  7) Ben Foster – 8 caps The Watford keeper has been in and out of the England squad so often since his first call-up 16 years ago that it was often hard to know his exact status. Foster retired from international football in 2011 to avoid being away from his young family after Capello treated him quite despicably over wanting to be present at the birth of one of his children – Foster’s not Fabio’s – though Hodgson convinced him to end his 22-month exile. The ex-Man Utd stopper made three further appearances, including one at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, but he hasn’t been seen in the international squad since November 2014 despite his form often warranting a return.  6) Rob Green – 12 caps Forever remembered for letting Clint Dempsey’s shot at the World Cup in 2010 slip through his hands and legs, an error which came on his last England start. Green’s brief spell came between James’ occupation of the Three Lions’ goal and Paul Robinson’s stint in the sticks with 10 starts in 63 squad appearances painting an accurate picture of a competent stand-in but never a first choice on the international scene.  5)Nick Pope – 7 caps The Burnley keeper, when fit, has been a mainstay of Southgate’s squads since 2018. He became the first England keeper to keep clean sheets in his first six appearances before John Stones dropped a bollock to gift Poland a goal a year ago.  4)David James – 53 caps James eventually replaced Seaman as England’s No.1 in 2002, five years after his senior debut, but he was replaced by Robinson after Euro 2004, following an error against Austria that saw The Sun depict him as an ass while hauling the poor, unsuspecting Mavis the Donkey to England training in a publicity stunt that led to the rest of the squad refusing to speak to the press in solidarity with their vilified team-mate. James regained his No.1 spot under Capello, lost it for the World Cup 2010 opener, got it back again, then lost it again when Hart was installed as No.1, with James pushing 40. Overall, James won 53 capsduring a 13-year international career that seems almost impossible to judge as a success or otherwise. 3)Paul Robinson – 41 caps The then-Leeds goalkeeper made his debut in the same game that Wayne Rooney was introduced to the senior England team – a 3-1 defeat to Australia in 2003 – but despite looking at one point as though he might enjoy a similarly prolonged international career, being first choice at Euro 2004 and the World Cup in 2006, Robinson suffered a slide that resulted in him being dropped by McClaren for the make-or-break Euro 2008 qualifier against Croatia – the same opponent who profited from Robinson’s famous air-kick from Gary Neville’s backpass. Despite a series of substitute appearances under Capello, Robinson – by now at Blackburn – failed to make the squad for the 2010 World Cup and retired from international duty shortly after.  2) Jordan Pickford – 42 caps Pickford remains something of a daft puppy in gloves but he’s Gareth’s daft puppy. The Everton keeper has struggled for form at various points since establishing himself as Southgate’s No.1 four years ago but rarely has the England manager veered away from the ex-Sunderland stopper. Aaron Ramsdale will doubtless have something to say about it but Pickford, as it stands, looks set to remain Southgate’s pick for the World Cup in Qatar never having made an error that has led to a goal while playing for England. Of course, for Everton it’s a different story.  1)Joe Hart – 75 caps England’s third-most capped keeper ever suffered a spectacular Pep-prompted fall from grace, so much so that his impressive body of work for England has largely been forgotten after he was bombed by Southgate in an awkward phone call prior to the 2018 World Cup. Southgate wasn’t wrong to say that Pickford, Butland and Pope had all had better seasons, mind, and that was the last Hart heard from the England manager and he remains on 75 caps. When he was at his best for England, we all assumed he’d still be in the sticks now with well over 100.  ",positive,liverpool,2

Ramsdale joined the Gunners in the summer transfer window from Sheffield United following their relegation from the Premier League. The fee Arsenal paid the Blades for the 23-year-old could eventually rise to£30m depending on a number of performance-related add-ons. But Ramsdale has already started repaying Arsenal with a number of standout performances this term and has won over many Gunners fans who had doubted his ability. Top ten players who have gone backwards the most this season Alexandre Lacazette was chosen by Arteta to take the captain’s armband until the end of the season when the Frenchman’s contract runs out. And Ramsdale thinks he could do a good job if given the chance next season by the Arsenal boss. “Listen, I’d take the responsibility but that’s down to the manager,” Ramsdale said in FourFourTwo. “We’ve got a lot of strong characters, though, and a lot of people who I think would be good captains. “Just to be told ‘you’re in a leadership role’ – I’d relish whatever. You never turn down a captaincy and I think I’d excel if I was given the armband, but that’s down to the boss.” Ramsdale replaced Bernd Leno as the Gunners’ number one earlier in the season and the England international has praised his German colleague for pushing him all the way this season. “With Bernd Leno pushing me every day, I know I can’t sit back and take it easy, because he’ll take the No.1 spot off me just as quickly as I took it off him,” Ramsdale added. “He’s been good with me – we fight for the same spot, but we have each other’s backs too. For me, it’s not about what happens months into the first season – I’d prefer to be judged four or five years down the line. “I thought [that becoming the no.1] would be a process of four months, maybe a year, but I was ready. I felt settled straight away, knowing some of the lads, and the manager made it so easy for me by saying, ‘Just go and play your game.’ Once I’d got in, it was so comfortable for me to do my stuff. “The fans have been absolutely amazing with me, too. There was obviously a bit of unrest when I signed – people were talking about me being a second-choice goalkeeper, costing a lot of money and the relegations – but that just gave me added motivation to win them over.” ",positive,liverpool,0

All transfer fees are taken from Transfermarkt. Arsenal – Aaron Ramsdale (£25m) Starting off with the toughest decision out of the 20. Aaron Ramsdale’s signing certainly raised plenty of eyebrows in north London but he has been excellent since joining from Sheffield United last summer. Ramsdale has made some crucial saves this season and his ability to play with the ball at his feet has allowed Arsenal to play out from the back better than they ever have before. Martin Odegaard has been superb under Mikel Arteta and was very close to getting in ahead of Ramsdale. Benjamin White and Takehiro Tomiyasu have also been very positive signings in what could end up being a superb season for the Gunners.  Aston Villa – Philippe Coutinho (loan) Aston Villa spent big last summer, bringing in Danny Ings, Emi Buendia and Leon Bailey. The attacking trio have not lived up to their price tags, however, meaning we have opted for January loan signing Philippe Coutinho. The Brazilian playmaker joined from Barcelona after a difficult spell in Catalonia and instantly hit the ground running in his Villa debut against Manchester United, contributing to both goals as Steven Gerrard’s side came from 2-0 down to draw. Having scored four and assisted three in ten Premier League appearances so far, it is likely that the Midlands club will utilise their option to buy the former Liverpool man at the end of the season.  Brentford – Christian Eriksen (free) Christian Eriksen has only played three games for Brentford since joining on a free transfer in January, but the 30-year-old’s comeback story is truly inspirational. Also, Eriksen is a huge name and head coach Thomas Frank was right to say the midfielder could be the Bees’ “best signing ever”. More will come from Eriksen, who has provided one assist for Brentford. The 109-cap Denmark international has already been recalled for his country and the extra minutes can only be good for Frank, Eriksen and his teammates.   Brighton – Marc Cucurella (£16m) Marc Cucurella has taken to the Premier League like a duck to water and has been a terrific asset for Brighton this term, operating as a marauding left wing-back. That £16m fee is looking like a bargain at this stage, with Chelsea already being linked with the Spanish international. Cucurella went straight into Brighton’s starting XI at the earliest opportunity and hasn’t been out of it since, completing 90 minutes in 23 of his 26 Premier League appearances.  Burnley – Maxwel Cornet (£13.5m) Burnley broke their transfer record last summer to bring in Maxwel Cornet from Lyon. The Ivory Coast international was predominantly a left-back for the Ligue 1 side, with Sean Dyche signing him to play as part of his front two. Cornet hit the ground running as a striker, developing a nice partnership with Chris Wood. However, since the New Zealand target man left for Newcastle, Cornet has failed to find the back of the net for Burnley. If the Clarets are to avoid relegation, the 25-year-old will have to rediscover his scoring touch.  Chelsea – N/A Harsh? Fair? We don’t care! To say that £100m Romelu Lukaku has been Chelsea’s best signing this season is a little bizarre, considering he has been nowhere near his best under Thomas Tuchel. Saul Niguez joined with a great reputation but looked lost in his first few months at Stamford Bridge. Minutes have been hard to come by for the Spaniard, who has started four Premier League games this campaign, being hooked at half-time in two of those.  Crystal Palace – Marc Guehi (£21m) Out with the old, in with the new sums up Crystal Palace’s summer transfer window perfectly. Patrick Vieira replaced Roy Hodgson; the Londoners released seven players aged 30 or older and brought in numerous young, exciting players. The most expensive new recruit was Chelsea defender Marc Guehi, whose excellent form in 2021/22 earned him a call-up to the England squad for this month’s friendlies against Switzerland and the Ivory Coast. Michael Olise has looked terrific at Selhurst Park and will soon be similarly knocking on Gareth Southgate’s door. Having predicted the 19-year-old to be the biggest bargain of the season, it was slightly tempting to pick him ahead of Guehi… Marc Guéhi's week: First @England call-up 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿Captains @CPFC aged 21 🙌Scores to help The Eagles reach an #EmiratesFACup semi-final 🦅 pic.twitter.com/yJA6FcBBlX — Emirates FA Cup (@EmiratesFACup) March 21, 2022   Everton – Demarai Gray (£1.8m) It has been a f**king terrible season for Everton – there’s no beating around the bush in that respect. Demarai Gray has been a huge bargain, however, joining for a measly £1.8m from Bayer Leverkusen. The English winger hasn’t actually scored this year, but his early-season form is enough to avoid us giving another N/A.  Leeds – Jack Harrison (£11.5m) Similar to Everton, it has been a rough campaign for Leeds. Harrison scored last week as the Whites came from 2-0 down to win 3-2 at Wolves. It was a huge result for Leeds, who have now won two in a row under Jesse Marsch. Harrison spent about eight seasons on loan at Elland Road before making his move permanent last summer. He’s not been great this but he has definitely been better than fellow summer signings Dan James and Junior Firpo. The latter has particularly struggled in the Premier League.  Leicester – Patson Daka (£27m) Leicester splashed out £27m on Patson Daka, who is the long-term successor to legendary striker Jamie Vardy. The Zambia international hasn’t really had a fair crack of the whip this season, however, netting four times in 15 Premier League appearances. Despite his average league form, Daka scored five in Leicester’s Europa League group and has scored one in two in the Europa Conference League. He’s not been great by any stretch of the imagination, but he does not look like a flop either. He has shown some good signs that he can fill Vardy’s boots in a season or two.  Liverpool – Luis Diaz (£40m) Luis Diaz looks the real deal and certainly a Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp forward. The Colombian has already made six starts in the Premier League, also playing 97 minutes in the penalty shootout victory over Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final. Liverpool essentially nabbing Diaz from Tottenham makes this transfer all the more worthy of being picked as the Reds’ signing of the season.  Manchester City – N/A Another £100m man not living up to their price tag has resulted in another N/A. Jack Grealish is a great player, but he has not looked it at Manchester City this season. In time, the England man will likely be as accomplished at City as Riyad Mahrez, but to say he has been the Citizens’ best signing this season just doesn’t sit right.  Manchester City and Spurs have run-in advantage over rivals  Manchester United – Cristiano Ronaldo (£13.5m) A £13.5m fee for the most marketable footballer in the world? No brainer.Cristiano Ronaldo has received plenty of criticism for his on-pitch performances this season, but in reality, he is the club’s top scorer with 18 goals in 33 games. Without the Portuguese superstar, United wouldn’t have made it out of their Champions League group after he scored six in five.  Newcastle – Dan Burn (£13.5m) January was a huge month for Newcastle. They made wise signings who have influenced their rise up the Premier League table. Dan Burn has come in and steadied the ship at the back, forming a solid partnership with Swiss centre-half Fabian Schar. The pair kept a clean sheet in Burn’s debut against Aston Villa. The Magpies went unbeaten for five games with Burn and Schar in the heart of Eddie Howe’s defence. Relegation is looking unlikely, which means the most exciting summer transfer window in Newcastle’s history is approaching.  Norwich – N/A I know what you’re thinking, but no, Norwich did not sign a £100m flop. They signed a bunch of flops for under £10m instead. Milot Rashica and Josh Sargent have both been poor and loan signings Ozan Kabak, Billy Gilmour and Brandon Williams don’t merit a place here with another relegation on the cards for the Canaries.  Southampton – Tino Livramento (£5m) Perhaps the easiest decision of the lot. Tino Livramento has been superb for Southampton since joining last summer. The England Under-21 international has played 23 times in the Premier League this season. He has been very steady under Ralph Hasenhuttl and has looked like an experienced top-flight full-back.  Tottenham – Cristian Romero (loan) Cristian Romero is already the best centre-half in the league according to many Spurs fans. He looks good – not that good – but he does look like a very promising defender. He technically joined on loan, but Spurs are going to make the deal permanent at the end of the season for a reported€50m plus add ons. Antonio Conte’s side are a lot better with Romero in the team and his form will be very important as the north Londoners look to beat arch-rivals Arsenal to fourth place. Cristian ROMERO vs West Ham: 📊|🇦🇷 ▫️68/74 Acc. Passes▪️4 Duels Won▫️3 Clearances▪️3 Interceptions▫️3 Acc. Long Balls▪️1 Key Passes▫️7 Recoveries 🔥🔥🔥 pic.twitter.com/oW07PSpriw — BD Albiceleste (@albiceleste4bd) March 20, 2022   Watford – Emmanuel Dennis (£3.6m) Watford are in great danger of relegation, but without Emmanuel Dennis’ goals they’d be pretty much doomed by this stage. The Nigeria international has scored nine goals in the Premier League this season, winning the Hornets ten points with his goal contributions alone. This was a very straightforward decision and £3.6m looks to be the bargain of the season. Here’s hoping Olise pulls his finger out.  West Ham – Craig Dawson (£2m) Craig Dawson spent last season on loan at West Ham before making his move permanent for a measly £2m. The 31-year-old is one of the first names on David Moyes’ teamsheet with the Hammers battling to finish inside the top four. And he cost peanuts. West Ham also signed Alex Kral and Alphonse Areola on loan and spent big money on Kurt Zouma and Nikola Vlasic. Zouma has been solid this season, but he kicked a cat, so I didn’t fancy picking him.  Wolves – Jose Sa (£7.2m) We love Rayan Ait-Nouri here at F365, but Jose Sa deserves recognition for the season he’s having at Molineux. Sa has set the tone at Wolves, who are usually very hard to beat.

Following spells at the likes of AFC Bournemouth and Sheffield United, Ramsdale joined Arsenal last summer. They paid around £30m to sign him. Arsenal were mocked for paying such a fee for Ramsdale but the ‘keeper has been one of the standout players in the Premier League this term. Improved Arsenal must show they can roll with the punches The 23-year-old quickly dislodged Bernd Leno to become Arsenal’s number one. Ramsdale has been putting his case across to start for England at this year’s World Cup in Qatar. The Three Lions have friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast later this month. The Gunners shot-stopper was named in the squad but he will no longer be involved. He missed their game on Saturday at Aston Villa. Arteta announced pre-match that Ramsdale had picked up a muscle injury and that he would miss the next few weeks: “Aaron Ramsdale had a muscle injury and will be out for a few weeks,” Arteta said (via Sky Sports). On Martinelli, he added: “He has been sick the last few days, so he’s out of the squad, unfortunately.” Elsewhere, Joe Cole has claimed that Arsenal missed a trick with former manager Unai Emery despite their resurgence under Mikel Arteta. It never quite worked for Emery at Arsenal after he was brought in to replace club legend Arsene Wenger, lasting less than 18 months at the club. However, since joining Spanish side Villarreal in the summer of 2020, he has gone from strength to strength, and won the Europa League last season. “Unai Emery was the right manager at the wrong time. Arsenal were in a state of self imposed disarray they were all over the place they had the post-Wenger years and they weren’t ready for someone to come in. “Everything he did he was getting criticised for. I think they missed a trick with that one although they’re in a good position now with Arteta.” Cole’s BT Sport colleague Rio Ferdinand added: “This guy knows his way around European football. “He’s done it in the Europa League numerous times for years and years. He’s won it numerous times at different clubs. “Sometimes it just doesn’t fit between a manager and a certain football club. But that doesn’t make him a bad manager. “The history he’s got as a coach. What he’s doing with this team now and beating Man Utd in the final last season. This guy is a top level manager.” ",negative,liverpool,0

The forward has not featured for the Gunners since the start of December. A “disciplinary issue” saw him fall out of favour with Mikel Arteta. The club were keen to get him out of the door in January and he was linked with the likes of Juventus and Newcastle United. Ten Premier League players stuck after January window closes Barcelona pushed to sign him on deadline day. There was conflict over finances but the clubs eventually agreed on a permanent deal. The signing is yet to be officially announced by Barcelona but he trained with his new teammates on Tuesday. Arsenal have now confirmed that Aubameyang has left the club: ‘Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left the club by mutual agreement,’ the club stated via their official website. ‘Auba joined us from Borussia Dortmund in January 2018. He won the Premier League Golden Boot in his first full season in 2018/19. He scored both goals in the 2020 FA Cup final win over Chelsea, and scored again at Wembley as we won the FA Community Shield against Liverpool at the start of last season. ‘Auba has been our captain for the past two-and-a-half seasons and made 162 appearances, scoring 92 goals in all competitions. ‘The 32-year-old was named African Footballer of the Year in 2015 and won the DFB-Pokal (German Cup) in 2017 during his time with Borussia Dortmund. His previous clubs have been AC Milan, Dijon (loan), Lille (loan), Monaco (loan) and Saint-Etienne, together with representing Gabon 72 times. ‘We wish Auba all the best for the next chapter in his career and thank him for his contribution to the club.’ It was revealed on deadline day that Aubameyang was “happy to accept any payment” to join Barcelona: “This whole affair has been relayed to us almost minute-by-minute by the Barca president Joan Laporta, who is at a Mundo Deportivo awards event. Laporta is in the business of giving hope to the fans and has been describing the situation as it unfolds. “It looked like the transfer wasn’t going to happen because the difference in what Barca could afford in wages and the percentage of Aubameyang’s wages, that Arsenal were prepared to pay, was too great. “Barcelona had 2m euros (£1.6m) in wages to pay and Aubameyang was happy to accept any payment in the end. Then Arsenal accepted a free transfer. That means the Gabon forward may just get 2m euros this season. Rather than the circa 9m euros (£7.5m) he was due at Arsenal.” ",positive,liverpool,1

Enock Mwepu was a major thorn in Arsenal’s side on Saturday afternoon. He set up Leandro Trossard for Brighton’s first goal before he scored one of his own in the second half. Gabriel Martinelli netted before the interval but this was ruled out by VAR. Martin Odegaard scored a consolation for the Gunners late on but they were beaten 2-1. The five biggest ‘title deciders’ in Premier League history Arsenal have now lost three of their last four games in the Premier League. They are level on points with fourth-placed Tottenham after 30 games. Spurs can move ahead of Arsenal points-wise if they pick up a positive result against Aston Villa on Saturday. Arteta said after the Brighton loss that Arsenal “made it really difficult” for themselves: “It has been a tough week; especially today because we wanted a reaction [to the defeat at Crystal Palace]. It came in the second half, which is too late. But we have to have the courage and personality to play much better and raise the level in the first half,” Arteta told BBC Sport. “We made it really difficult for ourselves. We were sloppy, we had no purpose to attack, we were really imprecise and we didn’t want to play forward. “We’ve shown for many weeks how well we can play; it has been a difficult week and we’ve lost some big players, but if you get what you want, not everything is going to be with a blue sky. This is our team in the good moments and especially the defeats. “There are many games to play but we have to be concerned about that performance, especially first half.” Mwepu added after the game that Brighton showed what they are capable of against Arsenal: “I’m glad we won today; we needed the three points, coming from six defeats is not easy. We really believe in ourselves, we have the right mentality in the group and we showed what we could do today. “The gameplan was to win. The mentality and the confidence the coach has shown in us [is huge]. We believe in ourselves. We just want to play and win for the fans. The win gives us confidence and more hope for the next games. We have Tottenham next and we will believe we can win.” ",positive,liverpool,0

The Arsenal manager rubber-stamped permanent exits for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Sead Kolasinac and Calum Chambers as well as loan exits for Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Pablo Mari and Folarin Balogun. Kieran Tierney has since been ruled out for the rest of the season while Thomas Partey might join him after pulling up with a thigh injury during Monday’s terrible performance at Crystal Palace. “It’s a little bit ambiguous but he has a significant injury and we’ll have to keep assessing him. He will be for some weeks. It could be [that he can play again this season] but it could not be the case, because it’s an area where he had a previous injury as well and he felt it straight away. He’s not fit.” Asked if he was regretting his decision to allow several players to leave in January, Arteta said: “They were players that we did not really use. And you put them in the context now, I don’t know how much they would have played. “You don’t know, I don’t know. We made a decision on what we believed was the right thing to do for the club, then for the players who were asking for the opportunity to play football because they didn’t have any minutes in several months. “If you can afford it and we don’t have to do the turnaround in the squad that we’ve had to do, if you ask me what I want it’s 22 outfield players and three goalkeepers.” Arsenal have been forced to put several young players on the bench in recent weeks; against Palace they had 19-year-old centre-half Mazeed Ogungbo, 21-year-old right-back Zak Swanson and 18-year-old central midfielder Marcelo Flores. Nuno Tavares was taken off at half-time of that game after a torrid opening 45 minutes and Arteta said: “Throughout your career you have to go through difficult moments, and he’s had some really good periods since he arrived at the club and he was playing many more minutes than he was probably expecting. That’s the life of a player, especially at that age. “There’s ups and downs and we are here to try and help him and make his career better, and that’s what we’re going to do. “His confidence probably wasn’t the best because he wasn’t playing a lot of minutes as well and probably wasn’t at his best and he needs the rhythm, the competition and the understanding with his teammates. “We have to help him to do that, but at the end of the day, when you’re in a match you have to decide if something can change the game and how can we make it better and on Monday we made that decision.” ",positive,liverpool,0

The Ghana midfielder was injured during Monday’s 3-0 Premier League defeat at Crystal Palace, with Kieran Tierney missing the game at Selhurst Park due to a knee issue. Tierney has since undergone surgery and is expected to be missing for the run-in as Arsenal aim to recover with victory over Brighton on Saturday. Big Weekend: Man City v Liverpool, Lampard, Arsenal, Cornet But their quest for a top-four finish has been dented further with Partey’s latest setback – and Arteta admits it could keep the former Atletico Madrid man on the sidelines for some time. “It is a little bit ambiguous but he has a significant injury and we’ll have to keep assessing him but he will be out for some weeks,” he said. Asked if Partey could play again this campaign, Arteta added: “It could be but it could not be the case – because it is an area where he had a previous injury as well and he felt it straight away and he is not fit.” Tierney went under the knife after picking up a knee injury while on international duty with Scotland – with Arteta casting doubt on whether the left-back will return in time to feature in their World Cup play-off fixture with Ukraine in June. “I don’t know yet, he just had a surgery yesterday,” added the Spaniard. “So it is very early to understand how everything is going to develop, he’s going to be out for the period that we estimate but to know what condition he will be after that period, I think it’s too soon to to be able to say something. “I think the player has to do the maximum that he can to be in the best possible condition as quick as possible. “I’m sure Kieran will do that and once he’s there, let’s see if he’s able to compete and with what kind of risk or not but I’m sure he will do that. “Our responsibility is to look after them when we have them here. “Once they go to a national team in this cases it is the job and responsibility of Steve Clarke to decide a team that he believes is the best to win games and we have to try to have good communications with national teams, which we have, but these things happen. “We lost two big players, really important players for us in the team for sure. “But we’re not going to have them so we cannot be crying for that because they’re not going to be available for us. “So we have to find other solutions and we have to still be as good and as competitive as we have been.” Arteta has been operating with a tight-knit first-team squad, with only 12 players featuring for over 141 minutes since January 1. Partey and Tierney are among that group and will have to now be replaced, with Nuno Tavares struggling at Palace after being called in at left-back. The summer signing from Benfica lasted just 36 minutes of the FA Cup third round defeat at Nottingham Forest in January and was hauled off at half-time on Monday night. “Obviously I speak with the players and I spoke with Nuno because I care a lot how they feel and we are here to help them, and make their careers better,” Arteta said. 💬 “There’s ups and downs and we are here to try and help him and make his career better, and that’s what we’re going to do.” 🎙 @M8Arteta #ARSBHA — Arsenal (@Arsenal) April 8, 2022  “That was a decision that hurt him, obviously, but he understands that it was for the benefit of the team, that I believe it was for the benefit of the team, and he respects that. “Now he needs to react on that situation, because it is a great opportunity to learn a lot in that period in your career.”  ",positive,liverpool,1

The Gunners were blown away by their old captain Patrick Vieira, who saw his side go two up inside 24 minutes through Jean-Philippe Mateta and Jordan Ayew before Wilfried Zaha’s late penalty added some deserved gloss. F365 says: Arsenal sleep through the din at Palace A 5-1 win for Tottenham over Newcastle on Sunday saw them leapfrog rivals Arsenal in the race for Champions League qualification but Arteta hit back at suggestions his young side are feeling the heat following a chastening night. “Overall, it is unacceptable, we hold our hands up, me the first one and apologise, we regroup, tomorrow is a new day and a new opportunity to start to prepare against Brighton,” the Gunners boss said. “No, because the pressure has been there for the last seven or eight weeks and we are talking all the time about the race and the top four and this is while they have been performing extremely well, getting results and playing well. “Today we didn’t perform and it is as simple as that. We were second best in every department, especially in the first half.” Arsenal had won six of their previous seven fixtures before visiting Palace, but looked unsettled from the outset and it was no surprise when Mateta nodded in a 16th-minute opener following Joachim Andersen’s header across goal. It was 2-0 eight minutes later when Ayew collected Andersen’s pass and bent his shot around Aaron Ramsdale and into the bottom corner. Selhurst Park was rocking now but Arteta would have again been left aghast at the defending of Gabriel Magalhaes and Nuno Tavares. The second half was better for the visitors but Emile Smith Rowe and Martin Odegaard squandered fine openings before Zaha’s excellent run won a spot-kick, which he converted to make it 3-0. “No, we have a game in hand still,” Arteta replied when asked about whether Spurs being fourth had been a psychological blow to his team. “We know in the nine games a lot of things are going to happen. We have to play each other, we have to play some big games coming up and we have to focus on ourselves. The problem we had today was not Spurs, it was us and what we did in the first half.” To compound a poor night for Arsenal, Thomas Partey limped off in what Arteta described as a “big concern” while Kieran Tierney is set for a scan on Tuesday that will determine the extent of a worrying knee injury. On Tierney, Arteta said: “He is seeing the specialist tomorrow and we will know more about the extent of the injury but the feeling that he had wasn’t really positive and what the scan showed either. We have to wait and see what happens.” Victory for Palace moved them up to ninth and extended their unbeaten run to seven matches ahead of their trip to Wembley in a fortnight for an FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea.

The Spaniard has been Arsenal’s manager since the end of 2019. He helped them win the FA Cup during his first season. The Gunners were disappointing in 2020/21 and they lost their first three league games of this campaign. Arsenal, Arteta should tell Neville to go fourth and multiply They have performed really well in recent months though as they are pushing for a Champions League place. Arsenal travel to face Patrick Vieira’s Crystal Palace on Monday night. The visitors will move back up to fourth if they win this game. They are level on points with fourth-placed Tottenham with two games in hand. Eduardo played 67 times for Arsenal between 2007 and 2010. He thinks Arteta “deserves all the credit he gets”: “Arsenal are growing quickly. They’ve improved significantly over the last few years, in a transition phase from Arsene Wenger to Mikel Arteta’s side right now,” Eduardo said (quotes via The Metro). “This year, for me, is the best that they have looked as a team in around eight years. They’re very close to getting back into the Champions League, and for that, they deserve a lot of credit – especially when you look at some of the teams they’re ahead of in the table right now. “Mikel deserves all the credit he gets. It’s very hard to compete with the likes of Manchester City and Liverpool, but they’re right up there behind those two as one of the best sides in the division right now. “Man City have a dangerous combination of a lot of money and the top coach in the world, while Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp have built a really strong squad. But that’s taken a few years. “When you look back at where Liverpool were when Klopp took over, and how long it took him to turn them into a title-challenging side with the identity they currently have, that’s maybe an approach Arsenal can look at taking. Klopp has strengthened in a couple of key areas with every transfer window, and it’s led to Liverpool challenging for the title. “Arsenal don’t spend a lot of money in comparison to those top teams, but they are building something special, step by step. I’m confident that Mikel Arteta – a fresh coach with new and exciting ideas – can replicate the success of 1998 and 2004 by turning this team into title winners in the next five years. I believe Arsenal can win the Premier League in the next five years.” ",positive,liverpool,4
78,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-gareth-bale-discovers-that-hell-hath-no-fury-like-a-madridista-scorned-real-madrid,Gareth Bale discovers that hell hath no fury like a Madridista scorned,"Gareth Bale has hit back at the Spanish newspaper Marca over their comments about him, and their response hasn’t exactly been dignified. Perhaps it was always inevitable that it would end like this. In a world in which footballers are treated as little more than commodities by both clubs and the media, perhaps there was inevitability about the petulance of what has been happening between the Real Madrid-obsessed Spanish newspaper Marca and Gareth Bale. Bale’s spectacular brace for Wales against Austria in the World Cup play-off semi-finals has prompted a most peculiar outburst in Marca and El Chiringuito, the football show that achieved viral fame with its troublingly obsessive-looking coverage of Lionel Messi’s transfer from Barcelona to PSG and Kylian Mbappe’s failure to sign a contract with Real Madrid. It was pretty clear that Gareth Bale had a message to send to somebody during the Wales vs Austria game, as he shouted ‘SUCK THAT!’ into a microphone while celebrating his first goal, and it wasn’t difficult to guess who he meant. The newspaper Marca had already run a story in which they described Bale as a ‘parasite’ over their perception that he’s running down the clock until the end of his contract with the club, and after the match, El Chiringuito’s absurd histrionics stepped up another gear when one of their pundits claimed that he should be ‘fired’ for ‘disrespecting’ Real. The latter of these two comments was just plain stupid, rather than particularly offensive. It’s vanishingly unlikely that Real Madrid would legally be able to fire him for upsetting their media fee-fees, and even if this were the case, with his contract expiring at the end of June regardless, it’s highly doubtful that it would be the greatest disaster for a multi-millionaire footballer to have to deal with. But this doesn’t alter the fact that he is absolutely entitled to see out the remainder of his contract. And then there’s the small question of whether this simultaneously childish and chiding tone actually even benefits Real Madrid at all. Real are one of the most famous football clubs on the planet, and are in the market for the very best players, players who can choose from any club to play for whatsoever. Does El Chiringuito really believe that acting this way helps or hinders their pursuit of the very best players? It’s possible that, say, Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe don’t care about this spat in the slightest, but it’s not difficult to imagine how a player who can go and play anywhere for vast amounts of money might take a look at the media culture surrounding this club and not take too kindly to the way that former(ish) players are treated.  The comments on El Chiringuito were delivered in their normal pantomime style and were pretty easy to dismiss, but the comments of Marca seem to have crossed a line for Bale, who issued a statement himself about the treatment that he’s been receiving in the Spanish media in which he described the comments made by Marca about him as “slanderous, derogatory and speculative”, and adding that, “I want to use my platform to encourage change in the way we publicly talk about, and criticise people, simply for the most part, not meeting the often unrealistic expectations there are projected onto them.” Marca have decided to defend themselves over this, but they didn’t make a particularly good job of it. Journalist Juan Castro – who, it should be pointed out, didn’t write the article that caused the furore, told the BBC: “We made really big positive headlines in the first years of Gareth here in Madrid, but sadly he stopped playing here in Madrid, he does not want to play here, he is always injured and has played only four games in La Liga this season, scoring only one goal.”So let’s take a quick look at what the journalist concerned, Manuel Julia, actually said: ‘The Bale parasite comes from the cold and rains of Britain. It settled in Spain, at Real Madrid, where, disguising its intentions, it first showed diligence and love for the grass, but soon its nature brought it to suck blood without giving anything in return. ‘More than blood, it sucked, and sucked, the club’s euros. ‘Unlike others of its species, like the flea, the louse, or the bedbug, the Bale parasite does not produce pain or sickness in its grass, but after sucking, between smiles and messing around, shows a tongue-in-cheek disrespect for that off which it lives. ‘He laughs, claps, throws itself to the ground, sings, in a kind of humiliating ceremony, which, at least, finally comes to an end, like all misfortunes.’ You stay classy there, Manuel. The moral high ground is always held by the person who describes someone who has angered them in subhuman terms, isn’t it? Bale has not played much this season, that much is true, but this is because he has not been selected to play in the first team, and it seems a bit odd to criticise a player for this, when team selection can hardly be said to be their decision. That choice rests with the head coach. And Bale has always been injury-prone. Again, presuming that he didn’t want to be injured, it’s not saying much for Marca’s sense of perspective that they should be criticising him for this. And regardless, there’s something to be said for knowing when to shut up, to be the ‘bigger man’, when it comes to this sort of subject. It would have cost Marca, a well-known newspaper, nothing to listen to Bale’s criticism and perhaps reflect upon the histrionic nature of their coverage, and it does little for their reputation to go after a player in the apparent support of a behemoth such as Real Madrid, in this way. How can they be trusted to speak truth to power in a country in which an absurdly disproportionate power over the game is held by two clubs? Perhaps this is a mis-reading of their role within Spanish society, but if the reality is that Marca is little more than a fanzine for this huge club, their output should be treated as such and taken as seriously. The good news for all concerned is that this unhappy marriage only has three more months to run, and that football will only be played during them. It will obviously be the best for all concerned for Gareth Bale to be rid of Real Madrid and for Real to have the money they’ve been paying to an injured player this season available to spend on someone else. It is also, when considering their outrage levels, worth pausing to recall that Bale has helped Real Madrid to 14 trophies during his time there, including four Champions Leagues and three Liga titles. His goal in the 2018 Champions League final against Liverpool is a strong contender for the greatest ever in the final of that competition. The strangest thing is that all these cheerleaders for the powerful football club on the planet should seem so insecure. Perhaps it’s what attracted them to Real in the first place. Meanwhile, Gareth Bale can continue with his Wales and his golf. After all, if this is how they’re going to talk about him, why should he lift a finger for the last two months of his contract? If anything, the comments of the last few days have only proved why he was right to not care about them in the first place. ",positive,liverpool,1

The Italian did not travel with the rest of Real Madrid’s squad as he is still returning positive tests for the virus. The 62-year-old is still planning to travel to London for Wednesday’s Champions League quarter-final first leg if he tests negative. Big Midweek: Chelsea v Real, Grealish, Liverpool, West Ham Ancelotti’s absence would doubtless prove a blow to Madrid, but Chelsea boss Tuchel still hopes his counterpart can be in the dugout. Tuchel missed Chelsea’s Club World Cup semi-final after a positive Covid test, but was able to jet out to Abu Dhabi in time to coach the Blues to their triumph over Palmeiras in the final on February 12. And the German insisted he could not wish that experience on any of his managerial colleagues. Asked if Ancelotti’s potential absence could affect Madrid, Tuchel replied: “Well, it does, but nowadays you are in charge of media, of virtual help, so I’m pretty sure he can do the team talks and be in touch with players. “But it’s always much better and nicer to be there and have direct influence. “It’s what we as coaches love the most, to be in the middle of the group, constantly communicate not only with words, but also with a smile, a hug. “I hope he still makes it, I have the information he will try to arrive in the evening. “He’s a big, big coach, big personality, it would be nice to have him on the sideline in these kinds of games.” Mateo Kovacic boasts three Champions League winners’ medals from his time at Real Madrid, but the Croatia midfielder also steered Chelsea to the European crown last term. The 27-year-old has thrived and found his niche at Chelsea, leaving Tuchel suitably impressed. He said: “He looks totally like a wonder kid in training, in some exercises. He had an outstanding training session today. “He’s a fantastic character, a lovely person, a humble guy, so interested in sport, so happy to train and deliver for the team. “I was following his career, you could see there was a next step coming. I was sure he had what it takes to make it. And I’m so happy to have him, he’s crucial to us both on and off the pitch. “You can see clearly that he was brought up as a team player; he knows what it takes and what culture is needed in a big club.” ",positive,liverpool,1

The Welshman had two spells at Spurs. He left the Londoners in 2013 as Real Madrid paid £85m to sign him. The 32-year-old has helped the Spanish giants win the Champions League on multiple occasions. World Cup draw throws England into a group of complications His relationship with the club has turned sour though as he has barely featured for them in recent years.

Arsenal are currently three points ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham in the Premier League with a game in hand. Bale is a beloved figure at Spurs, but Seaman would take him at Arsenal “all day long”: “I was going to say Arsenal, but I just realised he [Bale] played for Tottenham.

He’ll come back and hopefully, he’ll play in the Premier League. “Quality like that is good to see, especially with his free-kicks. It’s not just his free-kicks, it’s his delivery as well, the corners and the free-kicks he crosses in. It’s like James Ward-Prowse.” Elsewhere,William Saliba has once again discussed his Arsenal future, revealing his desire to “play as a starter” next season. “They’re often in contact with my agent. They send me messages and they watch my matches. They tell me that we have to continue like this. “I haven’t played much with the Gunners. The coach has made his choices, that’s life. I left on loan, I put the matches together, and I became an international. “What happened to me forged a tougher mind, it is not because you have cost €30m that you are playing. I take it positively, even if there are times that you wonder. “For six months I saw I was the only in the group not to play, that hurt. “Of course, I can’t be happy on Arsenal’s bench. I want to play as a starter. Afterwards, if I enter the rotation as a substitute, it’s not like being in the U23s and never being in the squad.” On potentially staying at Marseille, he said: “We’ll see after (the season). If I come back, it will be with great, great pleasure.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Perhaps it was always inevitable that it would end like this. In a world in which footballers are treated as little more than commodities by both clubs and the media, perhaps there was inevitability about the petulance of what has been happening between the Real Madrid-obsessed Spanish newspaper Marca and Gareth Bale. Bale’s spectacular brace for Wales against Austria in the World Cup play-off semi-finals has prompted a most peculiar outburst in Marca and El Chiringuito, the football show that achieved viral fame with its troublingly obsessive-looking coverage of Lionel Messi’s transfer from Barcelona to PSG and Kylian Mbappe’s failure to sign a contract with Real Madrid. It was pretty clear that Gareth Bale had a message to send to somebody during the Wales vs Austria game, as he shouted ‘SUCK THAT!’ into a microphone while celebrating his first goal, and it wasn’t difficult to guess who he meant. The newspaper Marca had already run a story in which they described Bale as a ‘parasite’ over their perception that he’s running down the clock until the end of his contract with the club, and after the match, El Chiringuito’s absurd histrionics stepped up another gear when one of their pundits claimed that he should be ‘fired’ for ‘disrespecting’ Real. The latter of these two comments was just plain stupid, rather than particularly offensive. It’s vanishingly unlikely that Real Madrid would legally be able to fire him for upsetting their media fee-fees, and even if this were the case, with his contract expiring at the end of June regardless, it’s highly doubtful that it would be the greatest disaster for a multi-millionaire footballer to have to deal with. But this doesn’t alter the fact that he is absolutely entitled to see out the remainder of his contract. And then there’s the small question of whether this simultaneously childish and chiding tone actually even benefits Real Madrid at all. Real are one of the most famous football clubs on the planet, and are in the market for the very best players, players who can choose from any club to play for whatsoever. Does El Chiringuito really believe that acting this way helps or hinders their pursuit of the very best players? It’s possible that, say, Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe don’t care about this spat in the slightest, but it’s not difficult to imagine how a player who can go and play anywhere for vast amounts of money might take a look at the media culture surrounding this club and not take too kindly to the way that former(ish) players are treated.  The comments on El Chiringuito were delivered in their normal pantomime style and were pretty easy to dismiss, but the comments of Marca seem to have crossed a line for Bale, who issued a statement himself about the treatment that he’s been receiving in the Spanish media in which he described the comments made by Marca about him as “slanderous, derogatory and speculative”, and adding that, “I want to use my platform to encourage change in the way we publicly talk about, and criticise people, simply for the most part, not meeting the often unrealistic expectations there are projected onto them.” Marca have decided to defend themselves over this, but they didn’t make a particularly good job of it. Journalist Juan Castro – who, it should be pointed out, didn’t write the article that caused the furore, told the BBC: “We made really big positive headlines in the first years of Gareth here in Madrid, but sadly he stopped playing here in Madrid, he does not want to play here, he is always injured and has played only four games in La Liga this season, scoring only one goal.”So let’s take a quick look at what the journalist concerned, Manuel Julia, actually said: ‘The Bale parasite comes from the cold and rains of Britain. It settled in Spain, at Real Madrid, where, disguising its intentions, it first showed diligence and love for the grass, but soon its nature brought it to suck blood without giving anything in return. ‘More than blood, it sucked, and sucked, the club’s euros. ‘Unlike others of its species, like the flea, the louse, or the bedbug, the Bale parasite does not produce pain or sickness in its grass, but after sucking, between smiles and messing around, shows a tongue-in-cheek disrespect for that off which it lives. ‘He laughs, claps, throws itself to the ground, sings, in a kind of humiliating ceremony, which, at least, finally comes to an end, like all misfortunes.’ You stay classy there, Manuel. The moral high ground is always held by the person who describes someone who has angered them in subhuman terms, isn’t it? Bale has not played much this season, that much is true, but this is because he has not been selected to play in the first team, and it seems a bit odd to criticise a player for this, when team selection can hardly be said to be their decision. That choice rests with the head coach. And Bale has always been injury-prone. Again, presuming that he didn’t want to be injured, it’s not saying much for Marca’s sense of perspective that they should be criticising him for this. And regardless, there’s something to be said for knowing when to shut up, to be the ‘bigger man’, when it comes to this sort of subject. It would have cost Marca, a well-known newspaper, nothing to listen to Bale’s criticism and perhaps reflect upon the histrionic nature of their coverage, and it does little for their reputation to go after a player in the apparent support of a behemoth such as Real Madrid, in this way. How can they be trusted to speak truth to power in a country in which an absurdly disproportionate power over the game is held by two clubs? Perhaps this is a mis-reading of their role within Spanish society, but if the reality is that Marca is little more than a fanzine for this huge club, their output should be treated as such and taken as seriously. The good news for all concerned is that this unhappy marriage only has three more months to run, and that football will only be played during them. It will obviously be the best for all concerned for Gareth Bale to be rid of Real Madrid and for Real to have the money they’ve been paying to an injured player this season available to spend on someone else. It is also, when considering their outrage levels, worth pausing to recall that Bale has helped Real Madrid to 14 trophies during his time there, including four Champions Leagues and three Liga titles. His goal in the 2018 Champions League final against Liverpool is a strong contender for the greatest ever in the final of that competition. The strangest thing is that all these cheerleaders for the powerful football club on the planet should seem so insecure. Perhaps it’s what attracted them to Real in the first place. Meanwhile, Gareth Bale can continue with his Wales and his golf. After all, if this is how they’re going to talk about him, why should he lift a finger for the last two months of his contract? If anything, the comments of the last few days have only proved why he was right to not care about them in the first place. ",positive,liverpool,1

Bale produced two terrific strikes on Thursday – one in each half of Wales’ World Cup play-off semi-final – as they won 2-1 against Austria to move within one game of ending their 64-year wait to play at a World Cup. Wales have played at the last two European Championships, but not at a World Cup since reaching the quarter-finals in Sweden in 1958. His match-winning performance for his country came just days after he had missed the El Clasico clash between Real Madrid and Barcelona. Peak Gareth Bale plays football like it’s a wide-screen movie Real manager Carlo Ancelotti had said he “didn’t feel well”, with the Wales management saying he had a “little niggle”. Bale, who has played just 77 minutes of club football since the end of August following hamstring and calf injuries, has been heavily criticised in the Madrid media. One media outlet described him as a “parasite” and Bale was asked after the game whether his goal celebrations had sent a message to his critics. Bale said he did not need to send a message, adding: “I don’t need to say anything, it’s a waste of my time. “It’s disgusting. They should be ashamed of themselves. I am not fussed, end of.” There are big questions about where Bale will be playing next season when his contract at Real Madrid expires. Barnett, Bale’s representative, told the Daily Telegraph: “Gareth doesn’t know what will happen in the summer, and everything depends on Wales. “We haven’t spoken to anybody and it will be a decision he makes at some time in June. “It’s unbelievable they [Real Madrid] haven’t played him, because he can still do things, as everybody saw on Thursday night. “If they got him into that team and involved, they would have a great player but we’ll live with it and get on with it. “He’s the greatest player that has ever played for Wales, and one of the greatest Britain has ever produced.” But TalkSPORT pundit and former England player Trevor Sinclair thinks Kenny Dalglish is the best ever British player. He said: “I was a massive Kenny Dalglish fan, back in the day, for what he did at Celtic and then obviously went on to do really well for Liverpool. “I remember him sticking his backside in, he was very strong, clever and had an unbelievable finish, so I think Kenny.” On whether Bale has secured legendary status for Wales, former Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan replied: “Of course he has. “If you’ve scored goals in Champions League finals for one of the biggest clubs in terms of reputation and achieving, at certain times, the level that he’s achieved there. “Also playing such a key role in the rise and ascension of Welsh football, of course you do. It’s difficult to understand why this huge talents finds himself in such a difficult position in Spain. “He hasn’t just found it with one manager, he’s found it with two managers in Madrid so there has to be a common denominator which appears to be him. “In the last couple of years there’s an argument to suggest that there’s more to be done. I don’t think he’s helped himself. “They take football remarkably seriously in Madrid, Steve McManaman didn’t have this sort of reaction, but to achieve what he did for Wales last night – he scored two phenomenal goals, you wonder where Wales would be without this level of talent available to them, so you have to give credit where credit is due.”  ",positive,liverpool,1

It feels like he’s been around forever, but it was only in 2006 when he made his debut for the Saints aged just 16 and 275 days. He played 45 games for the south coast club between 2006 and 2007 and scored five times but made a huge impression, winning Football League Young Player of the Year. His preternatural talent was spotted by Spurs, who turned up at Southampton with a large pottery pig filled with five million pound coins and promised to pay five million more if he met some targets. The Saints snatched the pig and pushed Gareth into Daniel Levy’s loving arms saying ‘you go with the nice man’. He was to spend six seasons at White Hart Lane. His first three were injury-hit and it was only in his fourth, fifth and sixth seasons that he managed to play over 40 games for the club and as he did so, he began to play further forward and not as a left-back. This reached its apotheosis in his final season, when he scored 26 times in 44 games, by which time Real Madrid were lifting their skirts at him and promising Mr Levy many riches if he would let them seduce his broad-chested boy. Mr Levy said it would take £85.1million to prise Bale out of White Hart Lane and, getting over-excited, Madrid turned on their money hose and drenched Levy in exactly that amount. Thus began an eight year love/hate relationship which saw Gareth earn more money than the GDP of several countries, score lots of goals and play even more golf. There were well-documented power struggles with manager Zinedine Zidane, rumours of discontent in the squad over his presence, rumours of all sorts of unpleasantness, most of which surfaced after 2016 when he’d signed a new six-year contract earning the thick end of 700,000 Euros per week. Yes, per week. Things got worse and worse. He was supposed to be going to China but Real wouldn’t let him go, or Real never received a request from Bale to go; take your pick. Eventually he went back to Spurs on loan and the numbers tell a good story of 16 goals in 34 games. So far for Los Blancos he’s scored 106 goals in 256 games and made 67 assists; that’s one goal or assist every 105 minutes. He’s won four Champions Leagues, scored in two finals, won two league titles and even a Copa del Rey. All of which isn’t bad for a man who gives the impression that football is a hobby that is secondary to his golf career (he plays off a 3 handicap). But his football legend does not stop there. As the best Welsh player of his generation, he’s long been a talisman for the national side and has rarely let them down. A man for the big occasion. A man who seems inspired by writing his own legend. A kind of Welsh super-hero who always rises to the occasion. And on Thursday, in the World Cup qualifier semi-final he did it again with two more goals, the first a magical free-kick. They were his 37th and 38th goals in 101 internationals. Still only 32, and out of contract in the summer, where next for Gareth?  Why the love?At some point Gareth changed. I remember seeing him at Southampton and in his early days at Tottenham, and his was a tall but somewhat slender physique. At some point, midway through his tenure at Spurs, he seemed to expand. His chest got broader, his thighs thicker and at 6’ 1″ he suddenly had the sort of body that meant if you ran into him, you would just bounce off and hurt yourself. He was always a fast player and as we know, fast players are always loved from the terraces. There is no finer sight in football than someone taking off at high speed. He was a fast runner as a kid, doing the 100m in 11.4 seconds, but at his peak, he was supersonic. The best expression of this speed was the infamous game against Inter Milan where, 4-0 down after about half an hour, he scored a hat-trick to lose the game 4-3 but win the second leg 3-1 to progress. The second leg was the famous ‘taxi for Maicon’ game. It’s worth pausing to remember how extraordinary that performance in both games was in 2010. In a very real sense it was the making of Bale. Those games elevated him. One moment stands out: Bale takes the ball in his own half, Maicon stands off him, Gareth just knocks the ball long and accelerates past the Brazilian at an extraordinary pace. For a moment they seem to exist in different space-time continuums as Bale collects his own through ball and delivers a cross for Roman Pavlyuchenko to score. It was so devastating that even if you hadn’t taken much notice of Gareth until that point, from now on, that game would be a marker against which he was judged. I think there is so much love for Bale simply because the way he plays the game is so extraordinary. There’s nothing half-hearted about it, nothing shy or retiring. At his peak he played the game as though it was a wide-screen movie. And yet, he’s not a star the way other high-profile players are, coming across as a little gauche or shy even. The top knot thing may or may not be your choice of haircuts, but Cristiano Ronaldo he is not.  Yet he is loathed by some sections of the Spanish press with Marca recently calling him a ‘Welsh parasite’. It was ridiculous that Madrid gave him such a lavish six-year contract, but the paper’s ire would be better directed at the club for this decision, rather than Bale’s to accept it. It’s true that Wales. Golf. Madrid. Banner did him no favours amongst the more notoriously hysterical football fans who treat the club as though it’s their mother. And further injury this season has limited his appearances. Yes it is obscene that he’s picking up all that money and he’s not even playing, but that is the fault of modern football’s financial insanity and useless contracts which don’t build in any performance-related penalties. And yet for all his appearances have become more sporadic through injury or through being de-selected, he can still score goals. His 2018 bicycle kick against Liverpool in the Champions League final was as outrageous as it was thrilling and in many ways is emblematic of the second half of his career as injury and age has robbed him of his blistering pace. Even though he can’t run full pelt for 90 minutes now, he’s lost none of the artistry and technique to strike a dead ball or when placed in front of goal. And many will want to trade on that even at 32.  Four great moments Taxi for Maicon   Overhead madness  So fast that he has time to run off the pitch and run back on and still be ahead.  Two wonderful Welsh goals   Future daysGareth is reportedly worth over £100million, so his next move is not likely to be motivated by cash. Clearly, no-one is going to pay him what he’s been on at Madrid anyway. At 32 he should have at least three years left in him, injuries allowing. The fear for any new club is that he’ll break down at some point, but if the price is right, then many will take a gamble on that. Being a Cardiff boy and having started his youth career at Cardiff Civil Service F.C., a move to the Bluebirds doesn’t seem the most massively unlikely thing, even if many Premier League teams would take him. I can’t see him staying abroad, for all the lifestyle pleasures it might offer. For all the honours and trophies he’s won, there is a feeling that latterly at Real Madrid, he’s been wasting precious time. A move now, to a club that will play him regularly and manage his fitness well, could easily lead to a late career encore, after which he can retire to the golf course for the remaining 50 years of his life. Even so, no-one can say he’s not fulfilled his potential. His game has given so many thrills which will never be forgotten. And for that we should all be grateful. ",positive,liverpool,1

They had a more direct idea than us and we wanted to let them run when in possession. “Defensively we were sometimes in a rush, they put us under pressure and we can defend these situations better. The second half was really intense, they needed breaks as well, but their counter attacks are not bad. Their decision making is really good and they always pick the right player. “I think it is a completely fine and deserved draw. We wanted to make sure they see my boys are exceptional as well. “Seven games to go for both teams and we will not stop chasing now that’s for sure. Let’s make sure we are ready for Benfica, for this team at Wembley [in the FA Cup semi-final] and then we will see who will have the better finish.” Klopp also told BBC MOTD:“It was an exceptional game of football. Two heavy-weights, chomping at each other. It’s crazy the intensity. A completely different level. The concentration levels from both teams… “What I liked the most was that in all situations we caused them problems and I felt we made a step in that department. I am happy. Would I have wanted to win the game? Yes. We have to win an awful lot of football and that doesn’t change. If there was one we could draw, it was today. We keep going. “We will use the game. I’m already in the Benfica game but of course we will try to understand the moments. City were more direct than usual and we were less. We will see what they do next time and us. It’s really fine for today. “It was a proper football game. If you played for another club, played yesterday, won it, trained today then watching City vs Liverpool.

Ajax are currently four points clear at the top of the table. Manchester United meanwhile have struggled this term as they face their fifth consecutive trophyless season.

However, ESPN reckon Ten Hag has beat the competition as United are ‘set to finalise’ the appointment of the 52-year-old. The report says that the Red Devils hierarchy have ‘settled’ on Ten Hag, with the Dutchman ‘ready’ to take charge in Manchester. Elsewhere,England players are reportedly ‘unimpressed’ by the ‘unfair criticism’ of them by Rio Ferdinand. Ferdinand was a ‘hot topic of dicussion’ among the England players in the international break, according toThe Sun.

The players are said to have no problems with criticism from Gary Neville and Roy Keane, but have taken issue with Ferdinand’s views on England, United and football in general. Ferdinand has torn into Harry Maguire, Marcus Rashford and Luke Shaw this term having been told by former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer that his comments about Phil Jones were “out of order”.

She alleged: “At full-time the Man United players started walking off. We were in the Park End so we were right by the tunnel where they came walking past – my son was there videoing them all. “He filmed all the United players walking through. And then he lowered his phone because Ronaldo had pulled down his sock and his leg was bleeding. He lowered his phone to see what it was – he didn’t even speak. “Ronaldo then just walked past, with a terrible, terrible temper and smashed the phone out of my son’s hand and carried on walking.” Mrs Kelly shared pictures with the Liverpool Echo of her son’s hand which appeared to show bruising. She added: “You can see by the bruise that he’s made contact. I just can’t believe I’m talking about it.”  “I was crying, I was shook up, Jacob was in complete shock – he’s autistic and he’s got dyspraxia as well, so he didn’t really digest what was happening until he’s come home now. “He’s really upset about it and it’s completely put him off going to the game again. This is the first football game he’s been to and this has happened. “We had an absolutely brilliant day up until those final few seconds when they came off the pitch. It’s completely ruined the day and put a bad taste in our mouth. “He’s an idol. Yes, he’s not from Everton and you like who you like, but Ronaldo’s a big player. My son’s always been like ‘Ronaldo’s going to be there’ – he’s an icon. “I’d understand if Jake was waving it in his face but he wasn’t near his face, it was down by the floor checking his injury. She continued: “He’s an autistic boy and he’s been assaulted by a football player, that’s how I see it as a mum.”  ",negative,liverpool,2

Ralf Rangnick’s side were beaten 1-0 by Everton on Saturday afternoon, a result which means United have won just once in their last seven in all competitions. Ten Hag or anyone else will need a miracle with this Man Utd… Portuguese star Ronaldo cut a frustrated figure throughout, struggling to have any sort of impact on the game. Ronaldo has just 12 Premier League goals this season, a dip off from the numbers seen from him in recent years, and despite only re-joining the club last summer, has been linked with a move away. Now, Hargreaves, who spent four seasons at Old Trafford, has claimed that Ronaldo has now had enough. Speaking to Premier League Productions (quotes via Metro), Hargreaves said: “What went right? A lot went wrong. What did they do right? “The effort isn’t there, their passing was poor, they didn’t have barely any shots on target. I don’t think they did much. “There’s a top-four place at stake here. Look, Anthony Gordon played like it meant everything to him. Everton could go down, but United could be in the Champions League where they all want to be. “Their names suggest that’s where they should be. But it didn’t feel like they thought it was must-win. You want them to put in a performance but we didn’t see it. “There was no real quality. Look at Cristiano Ronaldo during that game, he has had enough. He got no service. He got nothing to him. “There’s so many good players out there but really you’d expect way, way more from Manchester United.” The defeat at Goodison Park further hampers United’s Champions League hopes but interim boss Rangnick doesn’t believe talks over the club’s next manager is affecting his players. “I don’t think this should be an excuse. We are Manchester United. We have lots of international players. There shouldn’t be an alibi. There will be a new manager next season. If this is announced now or in 10 days it shouldn’t have an impact. “If you don’t score a single goal in 95 minutes we have to be disappointed. We had a good start and should have created more chances out of that domination. Then we concede a deflected shot and lost a bit of our composure. “The second half we were trying to add creativity with substitutions but we didn’t always take the right decision. “We had to do something. We needed a goal and we decided to bring [Juan] Mata and more verticality with [Anthony] Elanga. They were defending with their players in the last 35 minutes. “We didn’t find the right player at the right moment. We didn’t have enough players in the box when we played crosses. “It’s not only creativity. I think we had enough creative payers on the pitch. It’s also about being physical enough in the final third, being physical and trying to score a goal. We didn’t have enough players in the box.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Rooney, featuring as a pundit on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football, was asked if Ronaldo’s return to Old Trafford had worked out. The Derby County manageranswered “no” before suggesting Ronaldo needs to leave the club if United are to kick on. “I think he’s scored goals, he’s scored important goals in the Champions League early on in the season, he scored the hat-trick against Tottenham,” he said. Man United’s amazing plans to sign five starters for £20m “But I think if you’re looking to the future of the club, you have to go with younger, hungry players to do the best and lift Manchester United over these next two or three years. Obviously Cristiano is getting on a bit, he certainly isn’t the player he was when he was in his 20s, and that happens, that’s football. “He’s a goal threat but the rest of the game they need more, they need young, hungry players.” Clearly unhappy with Rooney’s remarks, Ronaldo replied by commenting “two jealous” on the Englishman’s Instagram post. Saha has now taken sides with the five-time Ballon d’Or winner after describing Rooney’s comments as “wrong”. “I don’t understand. I’m a bit surprised. To target Cristiano Ronaldo and say we need to move on is wrong,” he told BoyleSports EPL. “Why don’t we build young players around Cristiano? Let them learn and improve around him. “If those players cannot improve and grow then they are not good enough. I don’t agree at all and I think Cristiano has done an enormous sacrifice, but under criticism he has done well. The team hasn’t played well and I don’t like Cristiano being targeted.”  Responding to Ronaldo’s “jealous” jibe, Rooney said in his Derby pre-match press conference: “I actually saw that this morning and I’d probably say that there’s probably not a football player on the plant who isn’t jealous of Cristiano. “The career he’s had, the trophies he’s won, the money he’s earned, his six-pack, his body.I think every player, bar probablyLionel Messi, is jealous of Cristiano.”   ",positive,liverpool,0

Ronaldo has scored 18 goals in 32 matches this season for the Red Devils after re-signing for the Premier League club from Juventus in the summer. It is not a bad record in terms of goalscoring but he has been criticised for his overall performances and the impact he has had on the rest of the team. Gossip: Man Utd prioritise Leeds star, rival Liverpool for winger And Rooney suggested on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football this week that Man Utd should potentially look to move Ronaldo on in the summer. Rooney said: “You’d have to say no at the minute. He’s scored goals, important goals in the Champions League early on in the season. He scored obviously the hat-trick against Tottenham. “But I think if you’re looking to the future of the club, you have to go with younger, hungry players to lift Manchester United over these next two or three years. “Obviously, Cristiano is getting on a bit.

He’s a goal threat but the rest of the game they need more and they need young, hungry players.” Rooney posted a photo on Instagram of him in the Sky Sports studio that night and Ronaldo simply replied: “Two jealous”. And Rooney took the comment in his stride with the former Man Utd striker conceding that most people would be “jealous” of Ronaldo’s career and lifestyle. Derby County boss Rooney said in a pre-match press conference: “I actually saw that this morning and I’d probably say that there’s probably not a football player on the plant who isn’t jealous of Cristiano. “The career he’s had, the trophies he’s won, the money he’s earned, his six-pack, his body. “I think every player, bar probablyLionel Messi, is jealous of Cristiano.” 🗣 “There probably isn’t a football player in the planet that isn’t jealous of Cristiano [Ronaldo].

Maguire has been in desperately poor form for United, who are seventh in the Premier League table and have won just one of their last seven games in all competitions. The centre-back’s captaincy has been questioned and he was booed while away on international duty with England, despite being named in last summer’s Euro 2020 Team of the Tournament. Ten Hag or anyone else will need a miracle with this Man Utd… After Saturday’s 1-0 defeat at Everton, United legend Vidic encouraged his former club to take Maguire out of the firing line and play him only against easier opponents to enable him to rediscover his best form. “Every player has a problem with form at some time in his career,” he told The Athletic. “I did and it’s clear that Maguire is not at his best this season. I think you can do a few things and one of them is not to play every match as you try to find form again and get confidence. A coach could play him in easier games, not that there are many in the Premier League, and take him out for harder matches. “The player needs to feel powerful and strong on the pitch again, not as it is now where he feels that it’s not happening for him. It’s difficult to play well when you’re under so much pressure because people are waiting for you to make a mistake. “You’re asking me this and I’m replying as a coach.”  He continued: “It’s not a problem if a player says to his coach that he’s not feeling great on the pitch. If he says: ‘Give me a break, give me a couple of weeks to regroup and train well and then play again’. I had some horrible games for United and needed to find my peace and grow again.” Defeat to Everton leaves United in seventh, six points off Tottenham Hotspur in fourth.

Ronaldo, a five-time Ballon d’Or winner, has failed to live up to expectations since his return to Old Trafford, which many supporters hoped would put United in contention for the Premier League title. Instead, the Red Devils are seventh in the table, six points off fourth-place Tottenham Hotspur with seven games to go. Ronaldo has netted 18 goals in all competitions but has lacked consistency at times, with his all-round performances leaving a lot to be desired. Man Utd won’t improve unless they drop two players, Arteta out and… With Erik ten Hag set to be appointed as United’s next manager, club chiefs have concluded that Ronaldo’s reluctance to press will be problematic in the Dutchman’s high-octane system, meaning he will be ‘encouraged to leave in the summer’, according to MailOnline. Ronaldo’s display against Everton will have done little to alter this view. He failed to have an impact on the game and his frustration was laid bare at full-time, when he appeared to smash a fan’s phone on the floor.

Unless either of the prospective Manchester United managers can demonstrate a proficiency in sorcery, it hardly matters. That was evident yet again when the Red Devils went to Everton and chucked in the battle of the banter clubs. With these players, this dearth of character, this shameful lack of motivation, this half-arsed hierarchy, what chance has any new manager got? Any United fans pinning their hopes on either Ten Hag or Pochettino riding into Manchester to straighten out such a chaotically assembled squad is kidding themselves. Ten Hag reportedly proposed a five-year plan to rebuild the football club. On recent evidence, the Ajax coach could be written off as a dreamer; he will need ten. To say that the defeat to Everton is their worst performance of the season – the reaction on many on social media in the immediate aftermath of the final whistle at Goodison Park – perhaps feeds off a hearty portion of recency bias. Because United have played as hopelessly as that on a few occasions this season. And last season. And each time it gets harder to stomach, for the United fans who’ve fought the notion that their team is comprised largely of bluffers, and the neutrals scarcely able to fathom what this great club has become. So often have the players revealed their barely-concealed disdain for the travelling supporters that this result, to a team deep in the mire and themselves lacking the necessary bollocks, comes as no surprise. To an Everton side, pinned by Sean Dyche this week as one that ‘don’t know how to win’, the sight of the United circus rolling in to town must have been manna from heaven. Early winners: Everton back to f***ing basics and b*llocks The Toffees, themselves a shambles from top to bottom, at least had a cause to fight for. United did too – the top four – but you wouldn’t know it. Not from their intensity here, or last week at home to a Leicester side who spent the first hour waiting to beaten before they realised: “Lads, it Man Utd.” It took Everton and their fans just under half an hour to catch on too. Few grounds can be as intense as Goodison but initially it was just tense, which is understandable given what the home supporters have been subjected to by Frank Lampard’s side of late. United did not even need to quieten the crowd because the Toffees have spent the last few weeks doing that for them. Nor did it seem that it was the Everton players who geed up the Gwladys Street, more that Evertonians sussed that, actually, United really are as bad as reports had suggested. As if they couldn’t quite believe it without seeing for themselves. The opening goal, of course, swelled that belief among the Goodison faithful. And, of course, it came as a consequence of United failing to perform their basic tasks. Nemanja Matic, seemingly wading through quicksand all afternoon, failed to scan upon receiving the ball in midfield and gave up possession far too easily; Aaron Wan-Bissaka tracked back an overhit pass for Richarlison with his customary apathy whenever there is no prospect of a slide tackle; Matic offered an impression of a tackle to deny Alex Iwobi; before Anthony Gordon’s shot found the net via the shell of Harry Maguire. For the remaining hour, United did what they do best. They pretended. They pretended to attack, pretended to tackle, pretended to care. But there was no disguising their lack of intent. We could pick on individuals, but what’s the point? Every technical, tactical and mental deficiency has been nit-picked already on these pages and there was no new or interesting conclusion to draw aside from to question how far a group of players can actually drift. Like last week, this performance simply served to reaffirm every pessimistic view of these United players, with Ralf Rangnick surely more gloomy than anyone of their prospects. The interim manager has carried the air of a man who can scarcely believe what he is witnessing on a daily basis and the German called it on Friday: “Game plan and tactics is one thing tomorrow but the other thing, and probably the most important thing, is mentality, attitude, physicality.” The message, evidently, is yet to pierce the bubble these United players reside in.  Yes, some will go. Not enough since the club is still obliged to field 11 players on the opening day of next season, but there will be a clear-out of sorts. There has to be. United finished with a midfield of Juan Mata and Paul Pogba, both of whom are counting down the days to the end of their contractual obligations. Jesse Lingard too will be off and many of their team-mates will watch with envy as they skip towards the door. For Marcus Rashford, once more it looked like the novelty of playing for his boyhood club has vanished, while Wan-Bissaka appears to know that he can’t get away with it for much longer. But Pochettino or, more likely, Ten Hag will still have to work with many of these players, under these owners. For both, it’s not yet too late to block Richard Arnold’s phone number.

Son took the headlines after a superb hat-trick, along with Dejan Kulusevski’s fine strike, to send Spurs three points clear of Arsenal, making them favourites for Champions League qualification. Gossip: Spurs ‘to battle bitter rivals’ Arsenal for £60m-rated PL star But they were indebted to Lloris’ heroics in the first half as after Son’s early opener Villa laid siege on Spurs’ goal. The Frenchman made seven saves in the opening 45 minutes, including a wonder stop from Jacob Ramsey, which was the most by a Spurs keeper since data collection began. That allowed their lethal front three, with Harry Kane again notching two assists, to run riot in the second half. “What can I say? He saved us. We are scoring goals but if Hugo wasn’t there we were probably 3-1 or 4-1 down,” Son said of his captain. “Because Hugo saved us in a tough time when we needed him, he was turning like a superman, like a cat. It is insane, when he made the first save (from Ramsey) it was really close to him and the shot came really he just had them. He was like a cat. Hugo saved us. “It is a really special day for the team. It is a really hard place, we showed great personality, great character, especially after the first half. “Some teams are going to lose this situation because they can’t deal with it. We turned up in the second half really, really well and scored the second goal, third goal and fourth goal. I am really proud for the team. “The Premier League there is never one easy game. You go away from home and the supporters are different. “These are difficult places to go, 4-0 sounds easy but it is never easy. We did really well in the second half, we turned up and changed the game.” The only negative of a brilliant day for Spurs was an injury to Matt Doherty, who hobbled off in the first half after a heavy challenge from Matty Cash. He tried to play on but had to give up and was seen leaving the ground with a brace on his right knee. Boss Antonio Conte said of the injury: “I hope nothing serious, I hope. The doctors are going to check on him tomorrow (Sunday). “I hope nothing serious because he wanted to try to continue to play but then at the end he preferred to come off. “I hope so because Matthew is an important player for us and I hope this injury is not serious.” ",positive,liverpool,0

I just don’t think he’s suited to Premier League football where the pace of the game is very quick and intense. “A lot of money has been spent at United but in the wrong areas and on the wrong players, and that’s something they need to look at going forward. “I think Pogba will leave [in the summer] and that will be the right decision because we’ve seen how good he is atJuventusand with France – that’s the player I want to see but I don’t think we will see that at United.

It’s not just one player though, there’s many more issues that need to be addressed before United are going to get back on the right track. “Since he’s come back it hasn’t really happened for him or Manchester United.

The two heavyweights will lock horns at the Etihad in what has been billed as the ‘title decider’, with Liverpool just one point behind league leaders City as the season reaches its finale. Jurgen Klopp‘s men have won ten league games in a row and will feel confident going into the game, but a loss would be devastating with just seven games left to play. Pep has Klopp sussed – but Thiago can lift Liverpool Guardiola has sought to calm his side’s nerves ahead of the showdown by insisting that winning the title is not the be-all and end-all for City, who can simply “try again next year”. “What can happen?” he asked in an interview with Sky Sports. “Lose a game? And lose the Premier League title? Then we’ll just try again next year. “People say it, and it’s true – in life, there are more important things. I will be sad if we lose a game not being ourselves. But if we are who we are and the opponent can win – it’s ok. We are fortunate to live in this moment. Maybe I should feel the pressure now, but I don’t.” He continued:“When I was in my early years in Barcelona, I was more anxious about everything, more sensitive for everything. Now I handle situations a little bit more calmer. “I’ve learnt a lot at City. I’m a completely different manager and I feel I’m a better manager than when I started out because of the experiences.  “In Germany and Spain and now here, it’s been completely different challenges. I would say that that’s nice otherwise it would be so boring doing the same thing. “You can’t have the same ideas of 12 or 13 years ago, you become lazy, and you are not scared. You don’t have the intuition or the desire to think ‘oh, maybe we do it like that’ even though maybe it will be a mistake. “Always you have to make some evolution during the process. Evolution you do it to try to have success, yes – but especially, so you don’t get bored all the time doing the same at the end. “Life is about experiences and learning to improve different things.”   ",positive,liverpool,3

There have been rumours circulating that Rashford could look to leave Old Trafford after being left on the bench in recent weeks. The England international was left out of the Red Devils starting XI for their 1-1 home draw against Leicester City last weekend despite Rangnick not having any other recognised strikers to call upon. Ten Hag or anyone else will need a miracle with this Man Utd… Rangnick did chuck him into the line-up to face Everton yesterday, though, but decided to haul him off on 64 minutes, to the disbelief of Murphy and Wright. Murphy said on BBC’s Match of the Day: “Today he did not deserve to be taken off. “Wrighty and I were gobsmacked when he came off, there were other players on the pitch who weren’t contributing. From minute one he was trying to make things happen. “He was getting himself in central areas and in a game where United were struggling to create, he was the one trying to run in behind with his pace.” Fellow pundit Wright added: “I couldn’t believe it. “It’s one of those where we always knew he would be up against it with everything he’s done off the field. It gives people fuel to say ‘you should be concentrating on football’. “He’s going through a bad patch of form but it happens. The manager hasn’t worked at Manchester United so it will be interesting to see what they do in the summer.” Rangnick thought Anthony Gordon’s strike for Everton, which was the only goal of the game, turned the tide of the match against Man Utd. “The first 25 minutes we were in full control of the game,” Rangnick said after the match. “We didn’t even in those 25 minutes take enough and make enough advantage out of that dominating period in the game. “You could literally feel that they were crumbling after that result against Burnley, they were quite logically not full of confidence but we didn’t take advantage of that and with their first shot on goal, it changed the game and changed the atmosphere in the stadium. “In the second half they just defended with all their outfield players on the pitch and we were not able to break that wall down in the second half.” ",negative,liverpool,0

It only seems a matter of time before the Red Devils announce Ten Hag as their new manager with widespread reports confirming him as the club’s number one choice. Mauricio Pochettino, Julen Lopetegui and Luis Enrique had all reportedly been in the race at one point but Ten Hag is set to take over at the end of the season. Man Utd won’t improve unless they drop two players, Arteta out and… But Gullit has warned Ten Hag that he will face pressure from Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand and Paul Scholes with the trio “constantly talking”. Gullit told Ziggo Sport: “Is it the right choice?That remains to be seen. They want to play the football he plays, but it will be a really terrible job. “There are all these former players in the TV studios: Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes… There is constant pressure on the team, that is not easy. “Know what to expect, it’s a huge job.He also has to be given the time, but I don’t know if you get the time at Manchester United. “The former players are constantly talking, you have a lot of things on your plate and you have to be able to handle that. “I would like it if a Dutch trainer is successful there, because things are not going so well in Europe.” On interim boss Ralf Rangnick, Gullit added: “It is strange that you appoint a temporary coach who will later help determine the choice of a new manager. He’s going to be a consultant now, isn’t that weird?” Meanwhile, Rangnick has said his side “don’t deserve” to play Champions League football next season after they put in a poor performance to lose 1-0 against Everton on Saturday. That defeat means Man Utd are likely to miss out on Champions League qualification with the club now six points off fourth-placed Tottenham . “Whenever we score the first goal, we had enough confidence and we won most of those games,” Rangnick said. “But when you concede the first goal, we lost a little bit of our composure and maybe confidence. “With all respect to Everton because they have a good team, but if you don’t score against a team who conceded three goals against Burnley in the end you cannot expect to get anything out of it. “The players themselves should be eager to play international football, if possible Champions League. “But if we play like we did here we just don’t deserve it.

The Toffees are embroiled in a relegation scrap after losing 11 of their last 15 league games, with Richarlison failing to find his best form amidst the chaos. The 24-year-old has scored just twice in 11 league games and is set to push for a move away from the club this summer, even if Frank Lampard manages to keep Everton up. Ten Hag or anyone else will need a miracle with this Man Utd… That’s according to Brazilian website UOL, who claim Everton will demand a fee of€80m, equating to roughly £66m, to approve his departure. The report claims United are interested in Richarlison and will try to bring him to Old Trafford in the summer, but adds that they will have to rival Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur for his signature. United are in the process of appointing a new manager, with interim boss Ralf Rangnick due to step down at the end of the season. They have won just one of their last seven games in all competitions but after defeat to Everton on Saturday, Rangnick dismissed suggestions that gossip surrounding the club’s next manager is distracting his players. “I don’t think this should be an excuse,” he said. “We are Manchester United. We have lots of international players. There shouldn’t be an alibi. There will be a new manager next season. If this is announced now or in 10 days it shouldn’t have an impact. “If you don’t score a single goal in 95 minutes we have to be disappointed. We had a good start and should have created more chances out of that domination.

Ronaldo had returned to United’s starting line-up and played the full 90 minutes of the 1-0 defeat at Goodison Park. Following the match, footage on social media emerged which appeared to show the Portugal forward knocking a phone out of an Everton supporter’s hand and onto the ground as he walked off towards the tunnel.

United were dominant until Anthony Gordon opened the scoring midway through the first-half, but could not take advantage of their superiority. Gordon’s goal changed the game for Everton as the crowd got behind the home team, with Frank Lampard‘s side producing a resolute performance that secured a vital 1-0 win in their battle for Premier League survival. Ten Hag or anyone else will need a miracle with this Man Utd… As for United, they have now won just one of their last seven games in all competitions and interim boss Rangnick cut a frustrated figure as he delivered his post-match assessment of the defeat. “I think we had a good start into the game,” he said. “The first 25 minutes we were in full control of the game. Saying that, we didn’t, even in those 25 minutes, take enough or make enough advantage out of that dominating period in the game. “Especially on our left side, I would have wished us to create more overlaps, underlaps, and exploit this open space more than we did. We had our moments; we could have scored in the first 25 minutes, but I still, even in that period of the game, I would have wished us to have been more penetrating, to have more players up in the box.”  He continued: “You could literally feel that they [Everton] were crumbling. After that result against Burnley, quite logically, they were not full of confidence. But we didn’t take advantage out of that. “With their first shot on goal, a deflected goal, it changed the game. It also changed – which was expected to happen – it changed the atmosphere in the stadium. “And, yeah, the second half, they just defended with all their few players on the pitch, and we were not able to break that wall down in the second half.” The result leaves United in seventh, six points off Tottenham Hotspur in fourth.

Arsenal and Man Urd were both beaten earlier in the day soSon’s hat-trick and a fine Dejan Kulusevski strike sent Spurs three points in clear in fourth. Tottenham have now won four games in a row. They are now hard to look past for Champions League qualification. Liverpool ‘chaos’; Spurs awarded Arsenal’s transfer trophy Their deadly front three, with Harry Kane creating two of the goals, sealed the victory, but Spurs also have skipper Hugo Lloris to thank just as much. After Son’s early opener they were on the rack for most of the first half, with the Frenchman’s heroics keeping a rampant Villa at bay. Their lethal quality on the break in the second half saw them run away with it and inflict a fourth straight defeat on Steven Gerrard’s side. Tottenham would have enjoyed watching the results from earlier in the day come in, providing them with a real opportunity to take control of their top-four hopes. And they could not have dreamed of a better start as they went ahead in just the third minute through Son. Kane’s drilled shot hit Matty Cash in the midriff and fell perfectly to the South Korean, who fizzed a fine first-time effort into the bottom corner. But Villa’s response was admirable and Spurs needed their captain Lloris to step up with three big saves. First he palmed away a low Cash effort, then somehow clawed away Jacob Ramsey’s effort at the near post after the Villa man had weaved into the area before also stopping John McGinn’s swerving shot from distance. The hosts were all over Spurs like a rash, not letting their visitors breathe, and the chances kept on coming. Danny Ings shot straight at Lloris from a well-worked free-kick, Ollie Watkins headed over from Phillipe Coutinho’s cross and then saw the Spurs stopper make another save. The Frenchman was the busiest player on the pitch and had to keep out a Coutinho free-kick at the near post as he ended the first half with seven saves to his name. Gerrard will have been scratching his head as to how his side were not comfortably in front by the interval, so he probably knew what was coming in the second half. Just five minutes after the restart Spurs doubled their lead with a moment of real quality. Kane flicked on Lloris’ long ball into the path of Kulusevski and the Swede did brilliantly to fire a low shot across goal and into the far corner. Villa had run out of steam and Spurs landed a killer blow in the 66th minute as the Kane-Son partnership delivered again. It was Kane’s brilliant awareness that set Son clear, knowing exactly where to direct his headed flick, and the South Korean coolly converted past Emi Martinez. Son completed his hat-trick five minutes later, putting the finishing touches to a brilliant team move. Kane and Son combined to play Kulusevski in down the right and after a mazy run he cut back to Son, who swept home in style to claim the matchball. ",positive,liverpool,1

Enock Mwepu was a major thorn in Arsenal’s side on Saturday afternoon. He set up Leandro Trossard for Brighton’s first goal before he scored one of his own in the second half. Gabriel Martinelli netted before the interval but this was ruled out by VAR. Martin Odegaard scored a consolation for the Gunners late on but they were beaten 2-1. The five biggest ‘title deciders’ in Premier League history Arsenal have now lost three of their last four games in the Premier League. They are level on points with fourth-placed Tottenham after 30 games. Spurs can move ahead of Arsenal points-wise if they pick up a positive result against Aston Villa on Saturday. Arteta said after the Brighton loss that Arsenal “made it really difficult” for themselves: “It has been a tough week; especially today because we wanted a reaction [to the defeat at Crystal Palace]. It came in the second half, which is too late. But we have to have the courage and personality to play much better and raise the level in the first half,” Arteta told BBC Sport. “We made it really difficult for ourselves. We were sloppy, we had no purpose to attack, we were really imprecise and we didn’t want to play forward. “We’ve shown for many weeks how well we can play; it has been a difficult week and we’ve lost some big players, but if you get what you want, not everything is going to be with a blue sky. This is our team in the good moments and especially the defeats. “There are many games to play but we have to be concerned about that performance, especially first half.” Mwepu added after the game that Brighton showed what they are capable of against Arsenal: “I’m glad we won today; we needed the three points, coming from six defeats is not easy. We really believe in ourselves, we have the right mentality in the group and we showed what we could do today. “The gameplan was to win. The mentality and the confidence the coach has shown in us [is huge]. We believe in ourselves. We just want to play and win for the fans. The win gives us confidence and more hope for the next games.

Tchouameni was named Ligue 1’s Young Player of the Year last season after a breakout campaign which saw him start all but two of Monaco’s league games. The 22-year-old’s accomplished displays as a deep-lying midfielder caught the eye of clubs such as Chelsea, Man Utd and Real Madrid, all of whom retained their interest going into the January transfer window. The Premier League will be dead when Klopp leaves Liverpool… A report last month insisted that Liverpoolare now ‘more interested’ in Tchouameni than AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessieas they look to boost their engine room in the summer transfer window. And now Marca claims that Liverpool and Man United ‘have asked’ about the France international’s availability and Tchouameni ‘would not see the option [of a Premier League move] badly’. It is understood that Juventus are another team interested in the midfielder but thatTchouameni would not be willing to move to Serie A at this point in his career. The big rivals to the two Premier League sides comes from Spain, though, with La Liga giants Real Madrid eyeing upTchouameni as a replacement for Casemiro. He has been the subject of a number of ‘juicy offers’ already with the 22-year-old ‘aiming for the Premier League’.

With the Reds’ marauding right-back, who has provided two goals and a career-best 16 assists this season, sidelined for a number of weeks with a hamstring injury, the emphasis will switch heavily to the Scotland captain on the opposite flank. While he has not been as prolific as his counterpart he was man of the match in Wednesday’s defeat of Arsenal, setting up the important second goal for Roberto Firmino. “It is the full package of Robbo, not only as a player but a person as well. He wants desperately to deliver and work for the team,” said Klopp on Friday. “Even though he and Trent set up a lot of goals, there is still space for improvement in the decisive moments. “The goal (at Arsenal) was one of our favourite goals for a long time; first we win the ball back and second Robbo is waiting with his cross until he saw Bobby is now ready for it. “It was an incredible pass in the end and Bobby had to do a lot to get it past (Aaron) Ramsdale. “Yes played a really good game.

The Spanish defender joined Spurs from Barca’s rivals Real Madrid in the summer of 2020 for around £25million. Gossip: Man Utd want £24m Palace star; Neymar to Newcastle The La Liga side have an option to re-sign Reguilon in the summer for a £33.5million but it appears that Barcelona have now appeared as a potential destination. Spanish outlet Sport (via the Express) are reporting that Barca are looking for a long-term replacement for Jordi Alba and that Reguilon could be an option. The defender will still have another three years remaining on his deal when it gets to the summer meaning it could be hard for the a deal to be agreed. However, Barcelona could use two of their fringe players to sweeten the deal and it has been reported that Spurs are interested in the pair. Dutch forward Memphis Depay and defender Clement Lenglet could both be offered to Spurs in a swap deal for Reguilon. Deapy only joined the club last summer but after Barca brought in Ferran Torres, Adama Traore and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the January transfer window, he may find his game time significantly reduced. The singing of former Manchester City youngster Eric Garcia and the emergence of Ronald Araujo have seen Lenglet fall out of favour at the Camp Nou and Spurs are in need of a left-sided centre-half. Elsewhere, former Manchester City and Everton defender Joleon Lescott has backed Spurs star Harry Kane to move into a deeper role as his career progresses. “Strikers with his level of finishing ability are judged on their goal return and that starts with taking up the correct positions,” Lescott told LiveScore. “Cristiano Ronaldo is a prime example of someone who adapted their game to be an out-and-out goalscorer – but I actually think Kane may end up moving backwards with time. “He’s never been a forward reliant on having the highest leap or the quickest sprint. His intelligence, vision and movement are some of his strongest traits. It makes me think he could end up moving into an attacking midfield role in later years, not too dissimilar to Wayne Rooney.” ",negative,liverpool,0

We don’t feel like we were fairly treated. “We look at ourselves first and foremost because we can defend better. But other people have to look at themselves as well. “It’s a massive factor in what has happened.” Leeds boss Jesse Marsch admitted that the red card helped his side a lot. “I was focussed at half-time with helping the group with a few tactical changes then it was about making sure that our minds were straight and that we were ready to do what it takes. “I told the players who had come on as substitutes that I was happy to have them on the pitch and that it was a big opportunity for them, also that the whole group needed to stick together and push. “The red card obviously helped a lot, but we still had to stick together and push. “It’s been an intense year for the group. I am new in this so for me it is about helping them understand how deal with what has gone and then how to look forward and to get even better.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Ayling’s late winner clinched Leeds a vital win in their fight for survival after they had trailed to first-half goals from Wolves pair Jonny and substitute Francisco Trincao. Why the last eight will all win the CL (and why they won’t) But home striker Raul Jimenez was sent off for his second yellow card early in the second period and Leeds hauled themselves level with two goals in three minutes from Jack Harrison and Rodrigo before Ayling snatched all the points at the death. It was an impressive fightback from Leeds given they had lost four players to first-half injuries, including striker Patrick Bamford. Leeds secured back-to-back league wins for only the second time this season and moved seven points clear of the relegation zone. They were boosted by the return to the bench of both Kalvin Phillips and Liam Cooper after respective three-month lay-offs, but were dealt another injury blow in the 23rd minute when Bamford was forced off. It was tough luck for the striker, who had only returned from his own three-month absence due to a foot injury eight days earlier against Aston Villa, and he was replaced by Sam Greenwood in the 23rd minute. Wolves had to make a reshuffle of their own soon after when Ruben Neves hobbled out of the action and Trincao took his place. Trincao had an instant impact as he set up Wolves’ 26th-minute opener. The Portugal winger skipped clear down the right and cut the ball back for Jonny to steer home a low angled finish into the bottom corner. Diego Llorente was the next Leeds player to succumb to injury when he was replaced by Robin Koch. Trincao was a whisker away for firing a brilliant second goal for his side in first-half stoppage time when his left-footed 25-yard effort struck the inside of a post. Jimenez lobbed another chance wide following Pascal Struijk’s mistake and incredibly Leeds lost a third player to injury when Mateusz Klich was replaced by Charlie Cresswell following a clash of heads.

BILLLL!!!!! pic.twitter.com/OZttzqkFCX — Leeds United (@LUFC) March 18, 2022 Leeds goalkeeper Illan Meslier produced a superb save to divert Jonny’s goalbound shot, but Trincao left Leeds with a mountain to climb by adding Wolves’ second before the interval. Joao Moutinho’s quickly-taken free-kick caught Leeds sleeping and when Daniel Podence cut the ball back, Trincao planted a low finish inside Meslier’s right-hand post in the 11th minute of added time. It took only a few minutes after the restart when there was another halt in play due to injury. Meslier and Jimenez clattered into each other as the Leeds goalkeeper raced out of his area to clear a long ball over the top and both players needed treatment. Meslier was replaced by Kristoffer Klaesson, while referee Kevin Friend deemed Jimenez’s part in the collision warranted his second yellow card of the match and he was sent off. Leeds came storming back against 10 men. Harrison turned the ball home in the 63rd minute after Ayling had seen successive shots hit a post and cleared off the goalline. Rodrigo then struck the equaliser two minutes later from a tight angle after James’ effort had hit a post. Wolves refused to settle for a point as both sides went toe-to-toe, but it was Leeds who came out on top. Harrison and substitute Charlie Cresswell both had chances for Leeds and when the home side failed to clear a free-kick from their area Ayling lashed home an unstoppable shot in the 90th minute and it sparked a touchline melee as tempers flared in both dug-outs. Wolves poured forward in stoppage time and were denied an equaliser when the impressive Trincao’s fierce shot was superbly diverted by Leeds substitute goalkeeper Klaesson. ",positive,liverpool,0

Former United and Everton man Rooney started his career as a centre-forward but moved further back into an attacking midfield role later in his career. Why the last eight will all win the CL (and why they won’t) Kane is edging closer to Alan Shearer’s Premier League goalscoring record but his ability provide for his teammates and be involved in the build-up play has improved vastly improved in recent seasons. It’s this asset to his game that has made former Everton and Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott make the claim that he can see Kane following Rooney into a deeper role. “Strikers with his level of finishing ability are judged on their goal return and that starts with taking up the correct positions,” Lescott told LiveScore. “Cristiano Ronaldo is a prime example of someone who adapted their game to be an out-and-out goalscorer – but I actually think Kane may end up moving backwards with time. “He’s never been a forward reliant on having the highest leap or the quickest sprint. His intelligence, vision and movement are some of his strongest traits. It makes me think he could end up moving into an attacking midfield role in later years, not too dissimilar to Wayne Rooney. Kane has been heavily linked with a move away from Spurs, having missed out on a summer transfer to Man City, and Lescott believes United could be a good move for him. “I think he’d consider that very strongly. For all their faults, United are closer to winning trophies than Spurs right now. Not the Premier League, but knockout competitions. You could see them winning an FA Cup or Carabao Cup. “Somewhere like a Real Madrid or Bayern Munich would also be a good fit. But with Karim Benzema and Robert Lewandowski as good as ever this season, I’m not sure those are viable options. “It would make sense for United to try for him.

The Chicago Cubs owners have lodged their consortium offer for the Stamford Bridge club, ahead of merchant bank Raine Group’s Friday night deadline. Why the last eight will all win the CL (and why they won’t) New York bank Raine had set a cut-off of 5pm New York time for bids for Chelsea amid frenzied interest in the sale of the Blues. Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts has partnered with US hedge fund chief Ken Griffin on a potent submission, centred around sports ownership expertise and major stadium redevelopment know-how. Roman Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale on March 2, amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The 55-year-old was then sanctioned by the UK Government last week, after Downing Street claimed to have proved his links to Vladimir Putin. Russian-Israeli billionaire Abramovich has always denied those links, but had already moved to sell Chelsea amid the major geopolitical shift. Abramovich’s UK assets are frozen by the Government but Downing Street has allowed Chelsea to continue operations under special licence. The Blues are continuing to lobby for relaxations to that licence, but Raine Group is now expected to carry out a quick sale of the club. The Ricketts’ experience of steering the Cubs to the 2016 World Series title and also completing a major renovation of much-loved neighbourhood stadium Wrigley Field will bolster their bid. Plans for the redevelopment of the Stamford Bridge ground will be central to the bidding process, with more than simply the highest offer being considered. Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly remains another front-runner, with the US magnate understood to have added California investment firm Clearlake to his consortium. British property developer Nick Candy continued to build his own bid for Chelsea, with his submission appearing to go down to the wire. Candy’s bid involves a major renovation of Stamford Bridge to keep the Blues at their traditional home, with former Chelsea striker and manager Gianluca Vialli on board with his company Tifosy. A spokesperson for The Blue Football Consortium said: “I can confirm that the two South Korean firms Hana Financial Group and C&P Sports Group are a significant part of Mr Candy’s global consortium of investors. “Their involvement is representative of Chelsea’s global brand and huge loyal fan base in Asia.” ",positive,liverpool,0

The Brazil midfielder was originally shown a yellow card by referee Craig Pawson for his challenge on Allan Saint-Maximin late in Everton’s 1-0 victory only for VAR to advise the official go to the pitchside monitor. Big Weekend: Boro v Chelsea, Leeds, Spence, El Clasico Having looked at replays Pawson overturned his decision and issued a red card. Manager Frank Lampard disagreed, saying as Everton lodged their appeal: “In the cold light of day that is not a red card and we don’t want to lose Allan for three games.” However, an independent regulatory panel rejected the appeal – plus a second request to downgrade the punishment for excessive punishment – and the midfielder will now serve a three-game ban, starting with Sunday’s FA Cup quarter-final at Crystal Palace. Having only recently fallen foul of a VAR mistake, what Lampard does not want is another apology from referees’ chief Mike Riley. It is only just over two weeks since Professional Games Match Officials Limited general manager Riley called Lampard and chairman Bill Kenwright to admit mistakes were made when VAR official Chris Kavanagh failed to advise referee Paul Tierney over a handball by Manchester City’s Rodri, which would have given the Toffees the chance of a late penalty equaliser. “We had a really bad decision against us which we had an apology for but apologies don’t mean points,” said Lampard, speaking before the outcome of Allan’s appeal was known. “There was nothing from that other than a ‘Thanks very much’. This one there is no need for an apology. “It wasn’t a decision that should have been changed to a red card. It was very clear from my end.” Allan will also miss league matches against Burnley and West Ham. Lampard accepts mistakes will be made but struggles to understand the lack of consistency in the application of video technology. And while he does not want another apology he would welcome further dialogue with Riley. “There are question marks over VAR. I understand the human side and I don’t want to bang the drum about that,” added the Toffees boss. “I don’t think the conversation with Mike Riley is pointless, as long as the process gets better. “There will be faults in it because we are human. I make mistakes as a manager, the players make mistakes, this is the world we live in and we don’t want to get rid of the system but it is the consistency. “I’m very happy to have those conversations. We have to have them to move forward.” ",negative,liverpool,0

It never quite worked for Emery at Arsenal after he was brought in to replace club legend Arsene Wenger, lasting less than 18 months at the club. Big Weekend: Boro v Chelsea, Leeds, Spence, El Clasico However, since joining Spanish side Villarreal in the summer of 2020, he has gone from strength to strength, and won the Europa League last season. This season has seen them continue to improve in Europe and upset Juventus earlier this week to qualify for the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Now, former Chelsea and West Ham man Cole has claimed Emery was the right man at the wrong time for the Gunners. Cole told BT Sport (via Metro): “Unai Emery was the right manager at the wrong time. Arsenal were in a state of self imposed disarray they were all over the place they had the post-Wenger years and they weren’t ready for someone to come in. “Everything he did he was getting criticised for. I think they missed a trick with that one although they’re in a good position now with Arteta.” Cole’s BT Sport colleague Rio Ferdinand added: “This guy knows his way around European football. “He’s done it in the Europa League numerous times for years and years, he’s won it numerous times at different clubs. “Sometimes it just doesn’t fit between a manager and a certain football club but that doesn’t make him a bad manager. “The history he’s got as a coach and what he’s doing with this team now and beating Man Utd in the final last season this guy is a top level manager.” Elsewhere, Paul Merson has told West Ham midfielder Declan Rice to leave the club this summer, naming Chelsea and Manchester United as possible destinations. Writing in his Daily Star column, Merson said: “Declan Rice should strike while the iron’s hot and leave West Ham this summer. He’s taken his game to another level this season and is playing like N’Golo Kante now, affecting things at both ends of the pitch. “I’d be surprised if Declan Rice is playing for West Ham next season.

Rice has been in fine form this season for the Hammers, and is now widely recognised as one of the top midfielders in the Premier League. Was this the night that West Ham United finally came home? His performances have seen him linked with a move to a number of different clubs including Chelsea, where he played in the youth academy, and Manchester United. Now former Arsenal man Merson has urged him to make the move in the upcoming summer transfer window, naming the aforementioned clubs as possible destinations dependent on differed factors. Writing in his Daily Star column, Merson said: “Declan Rice should strike while the iron’s hot and leave West Ham this summer. He’s taken his game to another level this season and is playing like N’Golo Kante now, affecting things at both ends of the pitch. “I’d be surprised if Declan Rice is playing for West Ham next season. They have completely punched above their weight for months. “Where could he go? Depends what happens at Chelsea and who buys the club. Manchester United would be a good move, but will they get in the Champions League? That’s where Rice wants to play. “They play Tottenham this weekend and playing Spurs should always be a big game for West Ham but the Europa League game against Sevilla was a bigger one. “West Ham have gone past Spurs, and to be honest I don’t know how Tottenham have allowed that to happen. “You just hope West Ham don’t miss out on the Champions League by a point or two, because they will be kicking themselves. They will be wondering why they didn’t go out and get another striker in January.” United’s need to midfield reinforcements is well known, especially with Paul Pogba set to depart on a free transfer in the summer. Chelsea, on the other hand, have been been regularly linked with the England international, but any move could be dependent on the club’s ongoing ownership crisis. ",positive,liverpool,0

The Bees goalkeeper has been included in Luis Enrique’s 23-man squad for the friendlies against Albania and Iceland – but there is no place for Manchester United number one David De Gea. Big Weekend: Boro v Chelsea, Leeds, Spence, El Clasico Barcelona-born Raya, 26, joined the Bees from Blackburn in 2019 and helped them secure promotion to the Premier League for the first time. Athletic Bilbao stopper Unai Simon and Brighton’s Robert Sanchez will provide stiff competition to break into the international side. Frank, though, is confident Raya – fit again following an extended lay-off with a knee injury – can prove he is up for the challenge. “He was top three in the Championship, maybe better, the year that we lost in the play-offs,” the Brentford boss said. “He was heavily involved in the first goal that decided that (2020) play-off final (against Fulham) which was devastating for him. “I clearly remember going to him the day after saying he needed to be even braver and have an even higher starting position the next year. “We then got to the Premier League and he performed unbelievably well in the first eight games, then he got another slap in the face with the big injury. “He has come back even stronger. We all know that mental mindset is so important; that is one thing that only gets stronger with the setbacks. You can’t have a strong mentality if you don’t have any setbacks.” Frank told a press conference: “David has clear and obvious abilities in terms of playing with his feet, high position, and being very aggressive in coming for crosses.

Eriksen, who joined the Bees during January, has made successive 90-minute appearances in the past two Premier League games, and provided an assist in the win over Burnley. “It was a very special day for him, his family, and us involved, when he came on against Newcastle because of what happened back in June,” said Frank, who had a spell in charge of Denmark’s youth international teams early in his career. “That was a milestone and the next milestone he needs to get past is when he puts the Danish shirt on and steps into Parken (Stadium).

The Italian manager spent one season at Goodison Park, guiding the Toffees to a tenth-place finish in 2020/21. Everton get the win they needed in a game that made no sense He departed for Real Madrid last summer, however, and is enjoying a terrific season back in La Liga after leaving Los Blancos in 2015. Richarlison loved working with Ancelotti, and during an interview with the Brazilian version of Goal,he was asked if the 62-year-old is the best manager he has worked with. “Absolutely! He’s a winning guy,”said Richarlison (via Sport Witness). “I remember that once we went to play at home, if I’m not mistaken against Leeds. He wasfull of tactics, put us to play with three defenders. I said: ‘Wow, professor! Is there no way to put one more striker to help me up front?’ He turned to me and said, “Wow, Richy! You must be kidding!

If he stayed here, we would definitely reach a Champions League, a Europa League. His work is very good.” Richarlison was also high in praise of his current manager, Frank Lampard, and expects the Chelsea legend to be a success at Goodison Park. “We try to learn as much as possible from him” the Brazilian added. “As he was once a player, he understands our side, he knows that the moment is not so good, but he is always there, encouraging, talking to the players. “So we have everything to help him. It’s his second job in the Premier League, the first was at Chelsea. “He has everything to do a great job at Everton. It’s enough for the players to believe in his work, as we have been doing.

124,https://www.football365.com/news/feature-man-city-v-liverpool-five-premier-league-title-deciders-man-utd-chelsea-arsenal-newcastle,The five biggest ‘title deciders’ in Premier League history,"Ahead of Sunday’s potentially decisive clash at the Etihad, we’ve looked back at five previous ‘title deciders’, all of which involved Man Utd, with four proving pivotal… Newcastle 0-1 Man Utd – 1995/96The circumstances: Fergie’s United went to Newcastle on a Monday night having whittled down Newcastle’s 12-point lead – with a game in hand, too – to just four. Keegan’s Entertainers had lost and drawn in their previous two games but extending their advantage to seven points would have calmed the nerves on Tyneside as they chased their first title in 69 years. The game: Newcastle burst out of the traps and had United pinned back for most of the first half. But Peter Schmeichel was in the way of everything the hosts threw at his goal. When they beat Schmeichel, the crossbar denied Philippe Albert. Then, early in the second half, they got Cantona’d…  The impact:There was still a quarter of the season left (was it really a title decider then?) but the smash-and-grab win galvanised United and made arses on Tyneside twitch terribly. Newcastle continued to cave, losing three and drawing two of their last 10 games, while United won seven of their nine, three by the same 1-0 (Cantona) scoreline. It went to the final day but United breezed past Boro while Newcastle drew with Spurs to give the Red Devils a four-point margin of victory.  Big Weekend: Man City v Liverpool, Lampard, Arsenal, Cornet  Man Utd 0-1 Arsenal – 1997/98The circumstances: United entered March with a 12-point lead, somewhat juiced by the fact they had played more games than Arsene Wenger’s men. By the time Arsenal went to Old Trafford, the Red Devils had seen that reduced to nine after a defeat to Sheffield Wednesday and a draw with West Ham in the two games prior the welcoming the Gunners. The game:United were second best for much of it, with Tony Adams and Martin Keown passing every test the Red Devils posed. At the other end, Marc Overmars, Dennis Bergkamp and Nicolas Anelka caused United’s defence huge problems. It was Overmars who broke the deadlock by latching on to Anelka’s flick to coolly beat Schmeichel with 11 minutes remaining. United got desperate, with Schmeichel pulling his hamstring while retreating to his own goal after a late dash forward.  The impact: The victory left Arsenal six points off United but in control of the title race because of the three games in hand they had over the Red Devils. Fergie said it was inevitable that Arsenal would drop points – “There’s no question about that” – and they did. But only after winning eight in a row to secure the title after United drew two home matches with Liverpool and Newcastle. They were also dumped out of Europe by Monaco in their next game after the Arsenal defeat.   Chelsea 2-1 Man Utd – 2007/08The circumstances:Only three points separated leaders United and Chelsea when the two clubs met at Stamford Bridge in the antepenultimate game of the season. But United’s superior goal difference made it a must-win for Avram Grant’s Blues. The game:Chelsea were the better team but aside from a Joe Cole volley against the bar, they struggled to break a defence shorn of Nemanja Vidic early on after the centre-back put his face in the way of Didier Drogba’s knee. The Blues led, though, after Michael Ballack headed in on the stroke of half-time, but Ricardo Carvalho’s mistake gifted Wayne Rooney a second-half equaliser. That put United on the front foot and prompted Chelsea to squabble among themselves. But United conceded a penalty for the first time all season when Michael Carrick handled with four minutes remaining. Ballack stepped up to send Edwin van der Sar the wrong way and pile the pressure on United with two games left.  The impact: Despite having their lead cut to goal difference, United recovered their composure to win their final two games against West Ham and Wigan and make the Chelsea defeat inconsequential, while the Blues could only draw their last match of the season at home to Bolton. Chelsea had the chance for revenge in Moscow in the Champions League final but John Terry f***ed it.  Man Utd 1-2 Chelsea – 2009/10The circumstances:Chelsea were playing catch up again two seasons later but United’s cushion was just a single point as the two rivals met with six games left to go. The game:United were missing Wayne Rooney who had been injured at the end of the midweek Champions League clash with Bayern Munich. In his absence, the hosts struggled for creativity and they fell behind to Joe Cole’s flick in the 20th minute. The decisive moment came 11 minutes from time when Drogba headed in a second which was allowed to stand despite the Chelsea substitute being offside. Federico Macheda pulled one back, but Chelsea hung on for a huge win.  The impact: Chelsea moved to the summit with a two-point lead and they stayed there through the remaining five games, despite one defeat to Tottenham. United also won four of their last five but a draw at Blackburn after the Chelsea defeat, which was also followed by a Champions League exit, allowed the Blues to claim the title if they beat Wigan on the final day. They nicked it 8-0, then won the FA Cup to claim the Double.  Man City 1-0 Man Utd – 2011/12The circumstances: Both sides had wobbled in the title race, with City winning one in five to give United a three-point advantage when they went to the Etihad with three gamesremaining. United themselves had won one of their previous three before a derby from which a point would have sufficed to retain control. The game: Knowing a draw would do while City needed the win, Fergie opted for a defensive shape, leaving Rooney to toil up front on his own. City gladly accepted the initiative and they were the better side, deserving of a victory given to them by Vincent Kompany’s header in first-half stoppage-time.  The impact: City and United both won their penultimate games 2-0 against Newcastle and Swansea respectively, setting up a final-day shoot-out.

High priority ‘Erik ten Hag will make Ruben Neves his No1 priority if he lands Man Utd job after holding transfer talks with chiefs’ – Jordan Davies,The Sun exclusive, April 6. ‘Man Utd draw up three-man shortlist with Kalvin Phillips their top transfer target for midfield overhaul’ – Martin Blackburn, The Sun exclusive, April 8. Can your ‘No1 priority’ be different from your ‘top transfer target’? Particularly when they play in the same position?  The Dunn thing The back page of theDaily Mirroryells about how ‘Erik ten Hag could have just £20millon to rebuild the squad if Manchester United fail to make the Champions League’. Matthew Dunn’s piece, detailing ‘UEFA’s new Financial Sustainability regulations which were voted through yesterday,’ flies very much in the face of stories about Ten Hag inheriting a TRANSFER WAR CHEST at Old Trafford. The bloke has at least two No1 priorities so will need more than £20m. But also, it offers quite the juxtaposition with this Daily Mirror website story: ‘How Man Utd could line up under Erik ten Hag after Paul Pogba and Cristiano Ronaldo exits’ Absolute best of luck to Manchester United in their hopes of signingNoussair Mazraoui, Jurrien Timber, Kalvin Phillips, Antony and Darwin Nunez for £20m.  Shake and Beek That XI finds absolutely no room for the subject of another hugeSunexclusive on what is becoming a pretty stacked Manchester United midfield. ‘Donny van de Beek to be handed second Man Utd chance if Erik ten Hag is named new manager,’ writes Daniel Cutts in what is, remember, an item or story published or broadcast by only one source. Literally no-one else has ever suggested Van de Beek could feature under Ten Hag. No siree. This is exclusive. ‘The two Dutchmen worked together for more than three-years atAjax, and struck up a close relationship.’ Just been violently sick at the sight of that hyphen. ‘SunSport understands Ten Hag still holds him in high regard, and suits the style of football he wants to bring to Old Trafford.’ How strange that Ten Hag still quite likes a player he won three trophies and reached a Champions League semi-final with. And thank god someone exclusively noticed that someone who made 110 appearances under a certain coach probably ‘suits the style of football he wants to bring to Old Trafford’.  Diego, woah The Sun proudly proclaim that ‘OUR COLUMNISTS ARE THE TALK OF SPORT’ and Mark Irwin accepts the burden of proving why on Friday. He dedicates his article to ‘pantomime villain’ Diego Simeone and his ‘joyless, negative and downright soul-sapping team,’ whose ‘unacceptable’ approach against Manchester City ‘was an affront’ to the Champions League. To emphasise his point, Irwin draws comparison with the quarter-final that took place the following evening. ‘Wednesday’s game at Stamford Bridge was everything the Champions League is supposed to be about, a celebration of the world’s finest players going toe-to-toe.’ And the losers were beaten 3-1 at home by a very good team. ‘The previous evening at the Etihad, it was simply one team trying to engage with the paying audience and the other looking to suck the very life out of proceedings.’ And the losers were beaten 1-0 away by one of the two best teams in the world. Chelsea will definitely be happy that they played in a way that showed ‘everything the Champions League is supposed to be about’, rather than ‘looking to suck the very life out of proceedings’ like Atletico.  French fancy Lyon had more shots (six to four) and the majority of possession (62.8%) before Aaron Cresswell’s red card for West Ham on Thursday, but The Sun go all in on ‘the French dark arts and a smirking, remorseless Dembele,’ as if the forward should have shown any regret for being fouled in an important match. Jordan Davies continues to eulogise a ‘plucky’ West Ham for their ‘gumption and bravery’, while claiming Lyon ‘could not handle’ their hosts and ‘were forced to play’ after going behind. They are admonished for ‘using every time-wasting trick in the book’ and ‘slowing the game down with ‘injuries’ galore’ through their ‘devilish’ tactics. English team: brave, plucky and set for ‘revenge’. French team: remorseless, time-wasting masters of the dark arts who had to be ‘forced to play’ (and have 18 more shots than their opponents and almost three-quarters of the ball).  On your Emery way ‘Unai Emery aims subtle dig at Arsenal after his latest Champions League success’ is another headline on the Daily Mirror website and it is more than enough to pique interest; what could such a nice man, who has only ever really been complimentary on Arsenal, said about his former employers? ‘Speaking on Thursday, the coach was asked about the biggest clubs in the world and he reiterated that despite his experience at the Gunners and at PSG, those clubs were not on the same scale as the two giant clubs in Spain. Emery explained onMarca’s radio station:“When I have travelled with Arsenal and PSG, it is difficult to find around the world two teams as much in the focus of football asReal MadridandBarcelona.” And there’s your ‘subtle dig’. Emery reckons “it is difficult to find” two bigger teams in world football than Barcelona and Real Madrid. Translation: f**k Arsenal.   Treble makers In a continuation of Thursday’s Mediawatch, Ken Lawrence of The Sun calls Klopp ‘the Quadruple-chasing German’ but colleague Martin Blackburn makes no mention of the Treble when it comes to Pep Guardiola on the opposite page. It’s just a bit weird.  Singing the Blues ‘A distant third in the Premier League title race and outclassed by former Blues boss Carlo Ancelotti in Europe, there is a very real prospect of Chelsea now finishing the season empty-handed’ – Mark Irwin and Tom Barclay, The Sun. Way to brush over last season’s FA Cup runners-up still being in this year’s competition and facing the weakest remaining side in the semi-final. ",positive,liverpool,0
126,https://www.football365.com/news/feature-everton-too-good-to-go-down-premier-league-relegation,"Five clubs, like Everton, who looked too good to go down","West Ham had the talent and they appeared to have points. Not so. Forest had Brian Clough; Leeds had recently been in the Champions League semi-finals. With Everton facing the very real threat of relegation, we looked at the fortunes of five other clubs who were thought to be too good to go down. Leeds aside, it bodes well for a swift return if Frank Lampard becomes the first Everton boss in 71 years to be relegated… Nottingham Forest, 1993 Why did they go down? Brian Clough’s Forest finished eighth the season before and they began the campaign by beating Liverpool in the first ever Premier League match broadcast on Sky Sports. But the scorer of their winner that day, Teddy Sheringham, was sold along with Des Walker and Forest went into into free-fall. They won two from 21 after the opening day and were rock-bottom by New Year. Forest rallied with five wins in seven but it was a fleeting revival. Clough had run out of answers and before their relegation was confirmed in the second-to-last game of the season at home to Sheffield United, the Forest legend’s retirement was announced, bringing down the curtain on an incredible managerial career at the City Ground in desperately ill-fitting circumstances. How did they react? Once Clough had received the send-off he deserved, Forest appointed Frank Clark and set about returning to the top flight. They had to make do without Roy Keane, who was sold to Manchester United for a British transfer record fee. But Clark retained most of Forest’s Premier League squad while adding Stan Collymore, David Phillips and Colin Cooper. Forest made relatively light work of their season in the second tier. They finished runners-up behind Crystal Palace but with a nine-point cushion between themselves and those made to endure the play-offs. What happened then? Never a dull moment at Forest through the ’90s. Forest initially thrived back in the Premier League. They finished third in 1994-95 with 77 points and qualified for Europe. Then dropped to ninth the following season, before plummeting back to the bottom of the pile in 1997. Then they won the Championship. Before finishing bottom of the Premier League for the third time in seven seasons. They haven’t been seen in the top flight since.  Portrait of an icon: Brian Clough  Middlesbrough, 1997 Why did they go down? Because they literally didn’t turn up for a game at Blackburn. Boro were docked three points after they insisted they were unable to field a team at Ewood Park because of an injury and illness crisis. The FA weren’t having it and punished the Teessiders by stripping them of the points that ultimately would have saved them from the drop. Boro shouldn’t have been down there anyway after a recruitment drive saw them sign Juninho, Emerson and Fabrizio Ravanelli. A bright start had them fourth but Bryan Robson’s Boro then went 12 without a win to tumble down the table. They lost only two of their last 12 and reached both domestic cup finals. Which they lost. And they still went down. How did they react? Brilliantly. Ravanelli was gone and Juninho too – he’d be back, though – but Steve Gibson wasn’t put off from buying some big names. Boro bought Paul Merson at the start of their season in the second tier, with Paul Gascoigne, Marco Branca, Hamilton Ricard and Alun Armstrong all following. Mikkel Beck top-scored as Boro finished second, only three points behind First Division champions Forest and a single point ahead of Sunderland in third. Which precipitated the Black Cats’ famous play-off defeat to Charlton. What happened then? Boro found some safety in mid-table in the Premier League, finishing anywhere between seventh and 14th in the next 10 seasons. They also won their first major domestic honour and enjoyed a couple of thrilling UEFA Cup runs, including one all the way to the final.  West Ham, 2003 Why did they go down?Indeed, especially with that squad… Glenn Roeder, after finishing seventh the previous season, was able to field Paolo Di Canio, Joe Cole, Michael Carrick, Jermain Defoe and David James but the Hammers’ star quality counted for little during a dreadful first half of the campaign. Three wins in 24 games left West Ham bottom of the table. They roused themselves to win seven of their last 14, but it wasn’t enough to save their skin. With Trevor Brooking now in charge after Roeder had to step down due to ill health, the Hammers were relegated on the final day despite amassing 42 points. How did they react? By having a clear out. Through the summer and during the following season, the Hammers raked in around £40million for Cole, Defoe, James, Trevor Sinclair, Glen Johnson and Frederic Kanoute. Di Canio and Les Ferdinand also departed but Carrick stayed to play alongside new recruits like Matthew Etherington, Rob Lee, David Connolly and Nigel Reo-Coker. Roeder returned to the dug-out but he was replaced once again by Brooking upon being sacked three games into the season. Alan Pardew eventually took over and dragged the Irons to a fourth-place finish. But in Cardiff, they lost to Palace in the play-off final. They spent another year in the second tier, this time finishing sixth but Pardew’s side returned to Cardiff to beat Preston and secure a place back in the top flight at the second attempt. What happened next? Three top-half finishes in four seasons, but the Hammers failed to heed their warning after flirting with another relegation in 2010. Instead they appointed Avram Grant and went down in disgrace the following year.   Leeds, 2004 Why did they go down? As a consequence of ‘living the dream’. That was how Peter Ridsdale described Leeds’ approach to life in the early 2000s, when they went toe-to-toe with the biggest clubs in Europe, reaching the Champions League semi-finals in 2001. After splurging on players, the Whites finished third, fourth and fifth in the Premier League, but that last failure to secure a Champions League return left the club in a financial black hole. From fifth in 2002, they dropped to 15th the following season. A year later, £100million in debt and with most of their assets already stripped, Leeds finished 19th and were banished to the Championship after 14 years in the Premier League. How did they react? They sold what few decent players were left – Alan Smith, Aaron Lennon and Paul Robinson were their last remaining assets – before selling the training ground and their stadium. Kevin Blackwell was given the unenviable job of avoiding a second successive relegation, which he achieved after a start as poor as was anticipated. They finished 14th while being taken over by Ken Bates. What happened next? A brief revival to reach the play-off final, which they lost 3-0. Then they finished bottom of the Championship before spending three seasons flailing around in League One, eventually getting out of the third tier in 2010. It would be eight long seasons before Marcelo Bielsa arrived to part the clouds.  Newcastle, 2009 Why did they go down? ‘Mike Ashley’ is the short answer. His first season as Newcastle owner had replica shirt-clad Ashley downing pints in the stands with the fans. The appointment of Kevin Keegan to replace Sam Allardyce enhanced his popularity even further. But Keegan’s stay ended early in the 2008/09 season amid clashes with director of football Dennis Wise. King Kev’s exit saw the Toon Army turn on Ashley and his Cockney Mafia, one of its member being interim manager Joe Kinnear, who began his reign like this. Kinnear was given the job until the end of the season before having to step down due to heart trouble. Chris Hughton stepped in once more before Alan Shearer was handed the task of saving Newcastle from relegation through the last eight games of the season. Amid all the chaos upstairs, even with Michael Owen, Mark Viduka, Obafemi Martins, Damien Duff and Joey Barton, on the pitch the Magpies were floundering. After a 3-2 win at West Brom at the start of February left them snug in 13th place, Newcastle won only one of their remaining 13 matches to suffer a final-day relegation. How did they react? Owen, Viduka, Duff and Martins formed part of an exodus and thanks to Hughton’s seemingly endless reserves of patience with those running Newcastle, the caretaker boss was made the permanent manager and he inspired the Magpies to finish a 102-point season as the Championship winners. What happened next?All still on Ashley’s one-eyed watch, five seasons in the Premier League, including a fifth-place finish in 2012. Then history repeated itself and Newcastle were relegated in 18th before returning as Championship winners. Five years later, Ashley is finally gone and Newcastle are one of the richest clubs in the world.  ",positive,liverpool,1
127,https://www.football365.com/news/premier-league-preview-man-city-v-liverpool-lampard-arsenal-cornet,"Big Weekend: Man City v Liverpool, Lampard, Arsenal, Cornet","There’s one game to rule them all but intrigue all over the place in another huge weekend for most… Game to watch – Manchester City v Liverpool The managers and players can claim this isn’t a title decider until the cows come home – it doesn’t matter. For Sky Sports’ benefit as much as anyone, this is the title decider. City and Liverpool will win all of their remaining seven games against no-hopers. Goodbye logic, hello narrative: it’s winner takes all on Sunday. After a 2-2 draw at Anfield in October, with both teams on course for the Champions League semi-finals and set to face each other in the FA Cup semi-final a week later, the single-point lead Manchester City hold over Liverpool in the Premier League represents the only means of separating these two wonderful football teams. Liverpool haven’t won at the Etihad in the Premier League since January 2018, and given this isthe title decider, but also because they still have Manchester United and Tottenham to play, while City have just West Ham to face from the top half of the table, Liverpool need to go for it. But they both will. They always do; it’s unlikely to disappoint.  Manager to watch – Frank Lampard We’re essentially watching to see if Lampard has a crisis against Manchester United, which feels wrong. He’s lost seven of his nine Premier League games in charge of Everton, and even if you include the FA Cup wins over Brentford and Boreham Wood, he’s got the worst points per game ratio (1.00) of any Everton manager this century. Rafa Benitez must be chortling. He’s blamed his players. He’s blamed misfortune; as was the case when he was at Chelsea, he’s blamed most things other than himself. The general consensus until now has been that Everton are ‘too good to go down’, but that’s an opinion based on the quality of the players, not the manager. Richarlison, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Ben Godfrey and Jordan Pickford are all Premier League players, but when you offset their ability with the inability of the man leading them, Everton Football Club is not too good to go down. Lampard and his players need the Goodison Park crowd behind them on Saturday and an early goal will get those United player turning on each other. It always does. That’s got to be the gameplan: attack early and get the other team crumbling before they do. Team to watch – Arsenal Mikel Arteta’s side were truly terrible against Crystal Palace–he admitted as much. The defeat in itself wasn’t too damaging, it was the manner of it that will have worried the Arsenal manager this week. They’re level on points with Tottenham, but that’s a Tottenham very much in form and likely confident in their ability to pip their rivals to the last Champions League qualification spot. With the north London derby to come and a tougher run-in than Spurs, Saturday looks like a must-win. A home fixture against Brighton is about as comfortable a game as it’s possible to get at this point. Graham Potter’s side are safe and have been playing like it for a while. The point from their 0-0 draw with Norwich last weekend was their first in seven games. A win and a return to free-flowing attacking football against the Seagulls, and then Southampton, will be just the tonic ahead of Chelsea and Manchester United.   Player to watch – Maxwel Cornet The £13.5m summer signing scored his seventh goal and claimed his first assist of the Premier League season in the massive win over Everton on Wednesday. He didn’t sign to play in the Championship, he signed to play attritional, unattractive football in the Premier League, and another goal or two against Norwich would put them in the driving seat to keep the dour dream alive. Assuming Ralf Rangnick uses the same ‘lads, it’s Everton’ type team talk as Sean Dyche said he did on Wednesday, Everton won’t get anything from their Saturday lunchtime kick-off against Manchester United. So come Sunday evening, Burnley can climb out of the bottom three for the first time since alphabetical order wasn’t the defining factor in league position.   EFL game to watch – AFC Wimbledon v Milton Keynes Dons A grudge match, for obvious reasons. Milton Keynes Dons are gunning for automatic promotion to the Championship, while AFC Wimbledon are four points from safety in the relegation zone. MK Dons currently hold the second automatic promotion spot, but Rotherham are just two points behind with two games in hand. There will be even more needle than usual in this one.  European game to watch – Napoli v Fiorentina Napoli are one point behind AC Milan in the race for the Serie A title, while Fiorentina are two points off a Europa Conference League place and four points off a Europa League place. Serie A is a great league in general this season. Inter Milan and Juventus both also still have a chance at the title, while former Chelsea managers battle at Roma and Lazio just below them.

128,https://www.football365.com/news/feature-ranking-chelsea-strikers-drogba-lukaku-havertz-salah,Where Lukaku ranks among the 14 Chelsea strikers since Drogba,"It’s been almost 10 years since Didier Drogba packed up his shooting boots and left Chelsea forthe Chinese Super League. In the decade since, the Blues have attempted many times to replace the Ivorian goal machine, including a return for Drogba himself. For the most part, it has not gone well. When Alex Sewellfirst attempted this ranking in January last year, perhaps only two out of 12 could be qualified as a success.The £97million signing of Romelu Lukaku last summer was supposed to be when Chelsea finally got it right. But the Belgium hit-man’s return to Stamford Bridge has only served to prove Ole Gunnar Solskjaer right. We’ve added Lukaku – and Kai Havertz since he now seems to serve as a striker – to that initial dozen. It doesn’t reflect well on the club’s record signing… 14) Alexandre Pato I used to buy Alex Pato on FIFA 12 manager mode. I’d take Ipswich out of the Championship (those were the days), spend a couple of seasons in the Premier League, then put in a £35million bid for the mercurial Brazilian. He served me well – he had a good understanding with Grant Leadbitter – but he was so, so awful when he played for Chelsea. Signed from Corinthians on loan for the duration of the 2015/16 season, Pato made only two appearances for Chelsea, scoring one goal. I would say it was a total waste of a year for everyone involved, but that would be ignoring the fact that it produced the greatest fan-cam tribute video made about a player that I have ever seen. Three minutes of the forward giving the ball away over ever-increasingly jarring EDM is genuinely worth the watch for just how hilariously sh*t it is…  But yes, apart from that, it’s a no from me: 14th.  13) Radamel Falcao The 2015/16 season was not a year of successful loans for Chelsea. Alongside Pato came El Tigre on a season-long arrangement from Monaco. Having been shipped out to Manchester United the previous season and spending a pretty innocuous time there (four goals in 26 appearances), it felt like the obvious thing to bring him down to Stamford Bridge, satiate his extortionate wage demands and see if his luck would turn. It did not. One goal in 10 appearances for Chelsea leaves him 13th on my list. Unlucky, Radamel – maybe it’s a South American thing…  Benzema tears Chelsea apart with a *real* perfect hat-trick  12) Mohamed SalahIt’s not a South American thing. Mohamed Salah is arguably the best worst footballer in the world right now, but it’s all about being in the right place at the right time. Chelsea in 2014 was neither. Two goals in 19 appearances saw him shipped off to Fiorentina, then Roma. Where Salah began to make Jose Mourinho look a bit silly. But there was no suggestion in his performances at Chelsea that Salah would go on to be the goal machine he has become at Liverpool.  11) Romelu Lukaku Salah could reasonably claim he wasn’t given a fair crack of the whip at Chelsea. Lukaku, though he would probably try, absolutely cannot. The £97.5million Chelsea paid for Lukaku should have been a guarantee of goals. He couldn’t stop scoring for Inter Milan, where he took great delight in ramming Solskjaer’s assessment of his qualities back down his former manager’s throat. But at Chelsea, Lukaku has reverted to the Man Utd iteration when Thomas Tuchel really needed the Inter version. Tuchel is not one for hiding his feelings and his patience for the big-money centre-forward has evidently evaporated. It was already waning before THAT interview. The fact that 43 players have scored more Premier League goals than the division’s most expensive striker tells its own story.  10) Alvaro MorataAlvaro Morata cost £60million. Which seems like a bargain when compared to Lukaku. But the Spain striker endured a similar spell to the Belgian: a bright start before he quickly began eyeing the exit door, all the while looking increasingly forlorn until he could escape. And £60million for someone who got booked for diving in an FA Cup third-round replay against Norwich and then sent off a minute later for dissent is still £60million wasted. At least it would have been if Atletico weren’t so daft as to give them their money back.  9) Gonzalo HiguainReally very good at other clubs but ultimately failed at the Bridge? Hang on… I’m starting to see a pattern here. What is it about myopic, ill-thought-out signings, based on the ever-changing philosophies and tactics adopted by a conveyor belt of managers fired and hired at the drop of a hat by a Russian oligarch that somehow inhibits the long-term growth of a club? Couldn’t possibly tell you.   8) Timo WernerIt was reasonably assumed that Lukaku’s arrival would be bad news for Werner. The Germany striker’s opportunities have certainly been more limited but at least Lukaku has borne the brunt of the criticism that Werner was copping last season. And with good reason. Six goals in 35 Premier League appearances was a p*ss-poor return for almost £50million. Werner showed glimpses – occasionally he still does – but more often than not he seems on a different wavelength to his teammates. So many of his runs simply aren’t compatible with the service he is being offered. Werner has had to accept a more bit-part role in his second season while being shunted across the front line. Which at least showcases more versatility than Lukaku is capable of.  7) Loic RemyAnother talented forward whose time at the club slips into insignificance. Not a failure but certainly not a success, Remy felt like someone always on the verge of being really good. All the same, seventh in a list of 14 seems unjustifiably high. He was certainly no Didier. He was barely even a Michy.  6) Michy Batshuayi Batshuayi’s time at Chelsea has played out in fits and starts since the Belgian forward signed from Marseille in summer of 2016. He’s only played a handful of games for the Blues since 2018 following a spree of season-long loan moves, but his goal at West Brom to clinch the title for the Blues in May 2017 has secured his place near the top of the list. Somehow secured a contract extension last summer before being shipped out for a fifth loan spell as a Blue.  5) Samuel Eto’o He’d lost most of his pace that made him so electrifying at Barcelona and Inter Milan by the time he came to Chelsea, but nine goals in 21 appearances during the 2013/14 season isn’t a bad return.  4) Demba Ba Like Batshuayi, Ba’s career at Chelsea will be remembered for one specific moment: that goal against Liverpool. As a staunch Gerrard-over-Lampardian I find it hard to watch that slip and subsequent finish even now, but still, Ba was pretty good when he was at Chelsea. Not as good as he was at Newcastle playing alongside Papiss Cisse, of course, and his best goal came against Chelsea at the Bridge. But it’s a rule of thumb that Chelsea players are immediately less good than they once were just after the club pays big money for them.  3) Olivier GiroudIf Olivier Giroud were quick he’d be the greatest player ever. Better than Ronaldo, better than Messi, than Maradona, Pele, better than the lot of them. Instead he’s just slow and beautiful – but that doesn’t stop him being effective. Tall, wide, but with the first touch and skill of a man half his size, Giroud is the consummate target man. People thought his career was ailing when he headed across London to join the Blues from Arsenal, but since then he’s helped Chelsea to Champions League, FA Cup and Europa League wins and bagged a World Cup winner’s medal to boot. Perennially underrated, Giroud is just a really good, stupefyingly-handsome footballer who keeps proving his doubters wrong.  2) Kai HavertzThis time last year, Havertz was being pinned as yet another expensive flop. But his conversion from an attacking midfielder to a centre-forward or false 9 was just beginning. And Chelsea would have paid double the£72million they gave Bayer Leverkusen for the goal that won them the Champions League last May. Now, Havertz is Chelsea’s most threatening presence through the middle, as demonstrated during the first-leg defeat to Real Madrid, when he showed Lukaku how to bury a header.  1) Diego Costa It takes a sh*thouse to know a sh*thouse and when Mourinho brought Costa to Chelsea during his second spell at the club, it was a partnership destined for greatness. The tw*t’s tw*t, between 2014 and 2017 the Spaniard dived, spat and kicked his way to being the most divisive player in the Premier League. The sort of guy you hate until he’s on your side getting the opposition sent off and scoring goals. And score goals he did – a lot of them. His partnership withCesc Fabregas was magical and it was this combination that helped Chelsea to a fourth Premier League title in 2015. In the 2016/17 season, and under Antonio Conte’s management, Costa’s 20 goals again drove Chelsea towards a title. It was ultimately the breakdown in his relationship with the Italian that was Costa’s undoing at Chelsea and in September 2017, he returned to Spain to re-join Atletico Madrid – the club from which he’d joined the Blues. Despite only spanning three seasons, the volume of goals that Costa scored at Chelsea, the success of the club during his time there and the absence of any real rival for the title competition means he has to be their greatest forward at Stamford Bridge in the post-Drogba era.

129,https://www.football365.com/news/arteta-unacceptable-palace-defeat-was-not-down-to-top-four-pressure,Arteta: ‘Unacceptable’ Palace defeat not down to top four pressure,"Mikel Arteta insists that his young Arsenal side are not feeling the pressure of the top-four race following Monday’s 3-0 defeat at Crystal Palace. The Gunners were blown away by their old captain Patrick Vieira, who saw his side go two up inside 24 minutes through Jean-Philippe Mateta and Jordan Ayew before Wilfried Zaha’s late penalty added some deserved gloss. F365 says: Arsenal sleep through the din at Palace A 5-1 win for Tottenham over Newcastle on Sunday saw them leapfrog rivals Arsenal in the race for Champions League qualification but Arteta hit back at suggestions his young side are feeling the heat following a chastening night. “Overall, it is unacceptable, we hold our hands up, me the first one and apologise, we regroup, tomorrow is a new day and a new opportunity to start to prepare against Brighton,” the Gunners boss said. “No, because the pressure has been there for the last seven or eight weeks and we are talking all the time about the race and the top four and this is while they have been performing extremely well, getting results and playing well. “Today we didn’t perform and it is as simple as that. We were second best in every department, especially in the first half.” Arsenal had won six of their previous seven fixtures before visiting Palace, but looked unsettled from the outset and it was no surprise when Mateta nodded in a 16th-minute opener following Joachim Andersen’s header across goal. It was 2-0 eight minutes later when Ayew collected Andersen’s pass and bent his shot around Aaron Ramsdale and into the bottom corner. Selhurst Park was rocking now but Arteta would have again been left aghast at the defending of Gabriel Magalhaes and Nuno Tavares. The second half was better for the visitors but Emile Smith Rowe and Martin Odegaard squandered fine openings before Zaha’s excellent run won a spot-kick, which he converted to make it 3-0. “No, we have a game in hand still,” Arteta replied when asked about whether Spurs being fourth had been a psychological blow to his team. “We know in the nine games a lot of things are going to happen. We have to play each other, we have to play some big games coming up and we have to focus on ourselves. The problem we had today was not Spurs, it was us and what we did in the first half.” To compound a poor night for Arsenal, Thomas Partey limped off in what Arteta described as a “big concern” while Kieran Tierney is set for a scan on Tuesday that will determine the extent of a worrying knee injury. On Tierney, Arteta said: “He is seeing the specialist tomorrow and we will know more about the extent of the injury but the feeling that he had wasn’t really positive and what the scan showed either. We have to wait and see what happens.” Victory for Palace moved them up to ninth and extended their unbeaten run to seven matches ahead of their trip to Wembley in a fortnight for an FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea.

Antonio Conte’s men won’t look a gift horse in the mouth… Mikel Arteta took it upon himself to apologise to Arsenal fans on behalf of his players last week. But the Gunners boss should be seeking atonement for his own mistakes that made amends impossible against Brighton, all the while inviting Spurs to strengthen their grip on fourth place. Arsenal lost three goals and three points at Crystal Palace on Monday at the same time as being deprived of arguably their most important player. A thigh injury ended Thomas Partey’s evening at Selhurst Park prematurely and it remains unclear when the Ghanian might return. On today’s evidence, that cannot happen soon enough for Arteta. Since the turn of the year, Partey has excelled at the base of Arsenal’s midfield. The big-money buy from Atletico Madrid struggled for much of his first year in north London but since returning from AFCON, Partey has found his feet, screening Arsenal’s back four off the ball while dictating their tempo on it and offering the Gunners’ most effective route out of any opponents’ press. Partey was pocketed by Palace on Monday but the midfielder was hardly alone in having an off-night. A reaction was expected against Brighton but, largely because of Partey’s absence, it never came. At least not until they were 2-0 down at the Emirates. Arteta had a couple of options to replace his midfielder. The first and simplest was to shift Granit Xhaka into a deeper role; another was to pair the Swiss midfielder with Albert Sambi Lokonga and allow the pair to share the burden. Instead, Arteta opted to give Lokonga the job of pivoting his midfield, which he has yet to prove capable of, hence why the 22-year-old has started only once since November.  F365 Says: Ten Hag or anyone else will need a miracle with this Man Utd… Instead of double-pivoting with Xhaka, Arteta chose to field the midfielder at left-back, apparently reluctant to give Nuno Tavares another chance after his poor performance at Palace. It was a decision that backfired everywhere, with Lokonga swamped in a midfield that Partey might have danced through, while Xhaka looked every bit the central midfielder filling in as a full-back. There is obviously no like-for-like replacement for Partey in Arteta’s preferred system so the Arsenal manager may have to change his shape, especially if the Ghanian is missing for a large chunk of a tough-looking run-in.  There are no such concerns for Tottenham. Everything seems to be coming up Conte… The Spurs boss was able to watch United and Arsenal soil themselves before naming an unchanged side to face a woefully inconsistent Aston Villa. Three minutes in Heung-min Son gave Tottenham a lead with a glorious waft of his left foot. The goal, though, served to rouse Villa and, if their tackling is any indication, anger them. The Villans made sure there was a little something extra in every 50-50 and most of the 60-40s they contested. It was plainly a tactic decreed by Steven Gerrard, who pleaded for a 90-minute performance to be proud of. Villa got going more quickly this week than last Saturday at Wolves, but not before the early damage was done. Matty Cash took it out on Matt Doherty, who has been so impressive in Spurs’ re-emergence in the top-four race under Conte. Doherty tried twice to carry on but a third check from the physio prompted the end of his afternoon. For Conte, though, the loss of a key man was no problem. It simply meant the arrival of Sergio Reguilon, who might argue that he offers better balance as a natural left-sider. Seeing Doherty depart and Villa maintain their attempts to literally make their mark on their visitors might have seen Spurs wilt, or at least lapse in concentration. But Conte’s side were dead-eyed in their focus, asserting their retribution in front of goal. 7 – Hugo Lloris made seven saves in the opening 45 minutes against Aston Villa; since Opta have this data available (from 2006-07), it's the most by a Tottenham goalkeeper in the first half of any Premier League match. Resistance. pic.twitter.com/Rcau7gx4oi — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 9, 2022  Tottenham’s dominance was established with three goals glorious in their simplicity and a fourth that showcased their quality and superiority. Where a loose ball precipitated their opener, their second arrived via Route One, with Harry Kane nodding Hugo Lloris’s clearance intoDejan Kulusevski’s pass. Kane did the same again for Son’s second before the South Korean’s hat-trick came after Villa’s centre-backs, Ezri Konsa and Tyrone Mings, had been nutmegged and sat down respectively. Spurs’ creative movements and their resistance in the face of Villa’s force offered the starkest contrast possible to what Manchester United phoned in at Goodison at lunchtime. Arsenal may have showed Tottenham a clear path to the Champions League, but it should not be forgotten that United allowed them a free run at Conte when the Italian was available. Since Conte was appointed, only City and Liverpool have accrued more points, the last 12 of which have come as a maximum haul from four games that have put Tottenham in control of the fight for fourth. It’s hardly a foregone conclusion, with only three points separating Spurs and Arsenal who have a game in hand. But Conte’s side are purring and peaking while Arteta exacerbates the Gunners’ weakness. ",positive,liverpool,1

Gordon was able to alleviate the pressure that was on Everton after their 3-2 loss against Burnley on Wednesday. Neither side were at their best but Everton did enough to move four points clear of the bottom three. Gossip: Man Utd battle for £267m Premier League quartet Ralf Rangnick made half a dozen changes from the side that drew 1-1 against Leicester last week – Lampard himself made four – as Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcus Rashford were restored to the starting XI. The bustling Rashford was thwarted twice early on by Jordan Pickford but Ronaldo was largely subdued as United remain cut adrift from the Champions League places after being downed by Gordon’s shot, which thudded into visiting captain Harry Maguire and left goalkeeper David De Gea stranded. Everton, up until that point, were lacking in inspiration but they noticeably grew in stature after going ahead, when the mood around Goodison Park dramatically changed, although they were given relatively few scares by a United side that have won just one of their last five top-flight fixtures. Given both teams are low on confidence, it was perhaps little surprise that it was a cagey opening few minutes, complete with stray passes and the sides loose in possession, although Everton were particularly hesitant, with United getting on top and having two early sights at goal through Rashford. The hitherto out-of-form forward was lively on the left and had a snap shot parried away by the outstretched Pickford, who moments later excellently got down low to deny a header from the England forward as Gordon snuffed out any danger on the rebound. Everton appeared listless and lethargic, with their fans growing restless, but the atmosphere and momentum changed as they took a 27th-minute lead following some sluggishness at the back from United. Richarlison’s attempted cutback to Alex Iwobi broke just outside the area for Gordon, who prioritised placement over power and was grateful for a wicked deflection off Maguire, wrongfooting De Gea, as the ball sailed into the net. The goal galvanised Everton, with Michael Keane heading over shortly afterwards while another deflected effort, this time from Richarlison, had to be tipped over by De Gea. United were forced into a change before the break, with Fred seemingly nursing an injury and withdrawn for Paul Pogba, whose first meaningful contribution saw him upend Gordon on halfway to go into the referee’s book after the interval. Moments earlier Rashford had ghosted in behind the Everton defence and while he was unable to make contact with Bruno Fernandes’ pass, the ball only just trickled wide with Pickford out of position. It was to be Rashford’s last involvement as he and Nemanja Matic were hooked for Anthony Elanga and Juan Mata, with Ralf Rangnick using all three of his substitutes within 64 minutes. United gradually started to exert pressure in the closing stages, with Everton throwing bodies in the way when the ball was worked into the box, although Pogba forced a smart save from Pickford late on. Pickford was again called upon in time added on to deny Ronaldo on the half-volley after being teed up by Maguire before the referee’s whistle for full-time was greeted by an eruption of noise. Lampard pumped his fist on the touchline, and no doubt breathed a sigh of relief, following a momentous win – just the third in his tenure in the league in 10 attempts. ",positive,liverpool,0
132,https://www.football365.com/news/lampard-everton-loss-at-crystal-palace-due-to-a-lack-of-confidence,Lampard: Everton loss at Crystal Palace due to a lack of b******s,"Frank Lampard has put Everton’s 4-0 defeat at Crystal Palace down to a lack of confidence, as well as something more candid, throughout the squad. The Toffees went into Sunday’s match on the back of a crucial 1-0 win over Newcastle in the Premier League. Could this be Crystal Palace’s greatest ever season? After a positive start, Marc Guehi’s first-half header appeared to knock Everton back before Jean-Philippe Mateta doubled Palace’s advantage. After the heavy defeat, Lampard said that his players didn’t have enough “b******s” to make it through to the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. He said (via Liverpool Echo): “It’s done damage that we won’t go to Wembley, our fans won’t go to Wembley and we won’t have the opportunity to go to a final. But after the break it’s up to us. “There’s a balance of confidence stroke playing at the cut-throat end of football. This is a quarter-final today to get to Wembley, and if you haven’t got the confidence to play, then you can quickly flip to say have you got the b******s to play? Excuse me, but that’s the football reality. “If you fall somewhere in the middle then don’t worry about it. We didn’t play that badly today and Palace didn’t play that well today, and we lost 4-0. Because of a lack of confidence, and a lack of what I just said. “If you can’t be clinical in front of goal, you can’t score goals. If you allow people to stroll into your box to finish with ease, they’ll finish with ease. It was real basics.” Lampard is adamant, however, that Sunday’s defeat at Selhurst Park will not affect their bid to avoid relegation from the Premier League. “It should be nothing,” he said. “Every time we win people talk about momentum, every time we lose people talk about damage done. In reality, we need to be bigger and stronger than that.” Andros Townsend had to be replaced in the 17th minute after suffering a knee injury. Lampard has said the injury “looks bad”, saying that his departure had a negative effect on his team’s performance. “It looks bad, we think it’s a knee injury. He got his studs stuck in the grass,” the manager added. “We’ll scan him over the next day or two, but the early signs are that it will be a bad knee injury. “We were playing well, we started well, Andros was contributing. We stopped the game, the change of personnel – even after that I thought we remained in relative control until the goal goes in obviously. “It (the injury) was a blow in those terms, yeah. Two things hindered us, one was the scheduling – which is difficult to rely on when you’ve just lost 4-0. But we could have played at 3pm or 6pm, but the broadcasters want to show other teams. “And then Allan’s suspension not being turned over, because it was a wrong decision and it was easier to save face and leave him with a three-game suspension. We missed a big player today and we will now for two league games.” ",negative,liverpool,1

The Clarets went into the break 2-1 down to their relegation rivals. However, Jay Rodriguez and Maxwel Cornet netted in the second 45 minutes to pick up a crucial win for Dyche’s side. Man City are doomed and Luis Diaz impact is ‘unheard of’ Victory leaves Burnley one point behind Everton, who have a very difficult run-in from now until the end of the season. Next up for the Toffees is Manchester United at home, meanwhile Burnley travel to Carrow Road to take on Norwich City. Dyche has revealed what he said to his players at half-time with his team a goal down after Richarlison scored two penalties. He told Sky Sports:“A very important win, a good display in patches but better. It’s a restart really, we looked good in patches. “I think they’ve taken six points from 42 away from home so we thought there was an edge we could attack them. I reminded them at half-time that they had two soft penalties. But the reaction is very pleasing. “At half-time I said we need to get back to basics. We lost our shape and discipline and they had a pen out of nothing. Second half I said let’s go back to basics with a bit of shape and quality. “We created chances over the full game. Sometimes the mentality is hard. I’ve been down there, every season there are tough patches for us. You sense a team doesn’t know how to win a game, I said to our players that this lot don’t know how to win a game away from home. “It wasn’t glorious, but there were patches where we found three goals and I’m pleased with that. “It’s one game you know.

134,https://www.football365.com/news/everton-back-basics-bollocks-manchester-united-fabian-delph-allan,Early winners: Everton back to f***ing basics and b*llocks,"In a battle of two pretty terrible teams, Everton showed they gave a sh*t. Have you got the bollocks to play? That was the question asked by Everton manager Frank Lampard after a 4-0 demolition by Crystal Palace in the FA Cup and the answer after Premier League defeats to West Ham and Burnley was ‘actually, no’ but also ‘have you got the tactics to play?’ and ‘f***ing hell, this really is horrible and Everton really could get relegated’. The answer right now – after a victory that pulls them four points clear of relegation – might well be ‘actually, yes’ but also ‘it helps when you are playing a rank Manchester United side‘. Make no mistake, this was a terrible, terrible football match blessed with very, very little attacking quality. That it was settled by a heavily deflected goal is absolutely apt. But the difference between these two rotten football teams was that Everton cared. They really, really cared. They worked ridiculously hard with limbs thrown in front of shots, heads put on lofted balls, feet launched into tackles and Jordan Pickford’s be-gloved hand flying over the heads of various hapless Manchester United players. If that’s how you show bollocks then Everton have gonads for days. The charge was led by Fabian Delph, playing his first football of 2022 but picked for his sheer bloody-minded Yorshire-ness. This is the man who stood up in a Manchester City dressing-room after one defeat to United and said: “It’s just the basics of football. It’s simple. It’s straightforward. We stopped f***ing running in the second half. I’m not blaming anybody. I’m saying, it’s the basics of football.Winning our individual battles. Sticking together as a unit. F***ing defenders defending. Midfielders, box-to-box. F***ing keepers… Just the basics of football.” Just the basics of football. That’s what Delph brought to Goodison Park on Saturday with a performance full of simplicity and energy. Winning individual battles? Absolutely. It helps when you are playing against mannequins but everything he did was exemplary. He won the ball, he passed the ball, he cleared the ball into the stands when that was needed. As he came off after 84 minutes, he was still pointing to his head in the universal language of football to say ‘keep yours’. They did. With every block, every tackle and every towering header, roared on by a Goodison Park crowd that could yet be their 12th, 13th and 14th men in the fight against relegation. Ben Godfrey made 13 clearances, Allan made four tackles, Richarlison covered every blade of grass and then Demarai Gray came off the bench and flung himself selflessly into the path of a goal-bound shot because when there is such an obvious and overwhelming collective stance of ‘thou shalt not pass’, it is contagious. United could have had the ball for another two hours and still not scored. Some of that can be attributed to the putrid state of this famous old club in red but much can also be attributed to the back-to-basics, b*llocks out attitude of these Everton players. Is it what Everton need going forward to establish themselves back among the middle tier of Premier League clubs? Absolutely not. But is it what they need to survive this season and remain in the top flight? God yes. READ MORE: What next for Lampard if he manages to get Everton relegated? ",positive,liverpool,0
135,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-man-utd-1-1-leicester-rashford-rangnick-maguire,"Early loser: Marcus Rashford and Man Utd, ghosting to the beach","Manchester United look like they can’t wait for the season to end and for a new manager to arrive. No one more so than the ghost of Marcus Rashford… Individually and collectively, Manchester United’s draw with Leicester reaffirmed every little thing we already knew about these Red Devils. And doubtless reinforced all the opinions formed by Ralf Rangnick during his four-month stint so far. Even if the interim manager would prefer that we didn’t attribute ownership of this rabble to him, Rangnick’s men were once again painfully passive against the Foxes, with some players scratching around for confidence while others barely bothered to seek the motivation they so woefully lacked. Despite a Champions League place still being within reach, United grabbed the holiday brochures. It’s all been said and written before and absolutely nothing occurred at Old Trafford to provoke any rethink of the judgements already made of this squad. David De Gea pulled off another world-class save to spare United further embarrassment, and Fred was one of few in red to show himself in a positive light. Beyond that pair, and Bruno Fernandes’s intensity even if the finesse was lacking, there are very few other reasons to be positive in the wake of another draw that could leave them in seventh place come Monday night, six points off Arsenal having played a game more.  Some players have more reason than most to mope their way to the beach. Marcus Rashford for one… The United forward has had a rotten season. Obviously, he’s in good company, but Rashford has looked a shell of the player we all know he can be. So his already depleted reserves of confidence must have evaporated completely upon hearing Rangnick’s line up. With Cristiano Ronaldo absent with flu-like symptoms and Edinson Cavani apparently allergic to English grass, Rangnick decided that playing with no striker was better than using Rashford through the middle. ‘Big decision’ – Neville concerned about Man Utd star ‘having massive low’ Rangnick opted for a similar tactic in the embarrassing derby defeat to City, an experiment which ought never to have been repeated. But Rashford watched on again as Fernandes buzzed and Paul Pogba preened, all the while United attempted to switch the play from side to side, too often finding touch rather than a team-mate. The absence of a focal point in their front line was excruciatingly apparent. The false 9 system is intended to perplex centre-backs used to being touch-tight and to draw them from their posts but the only players befuddled by United’s set up were their own. Even at half-time, Rangnick refused to turn to the child-feeder. Belatedly, with 10 equally-listless minutes gone in the second period, Rashford was called back from his lone warm-up to end Scott McTominay’s miserable evening. Roared on to the pitch by a United crowd counting down the days until the end of the season, the stage was set for Rashford to make his point to Rangnick. But Rashford simply emphasised Rangnick’s. In his first half an hour, the forward managed a miserable four touches, two of which were in his own half and none inside the Leicester box. For that, the blame goes beyond Rashford; it can be spread throughout his team-mates and all the way to the coaching staff. But Rashford carried the air of a young man just hoping to stay out of sight until the final whistle. When he was thrust into the box and into action, upon United offering something resembling intent in added time, Rashford’s two moments that could have marked a turning point, for himself if probably not his side, summed up the rut he and United find themselves in. First, the ball passed through him like the ghost some have described him as lately on the way to Jadon Sancho, who horribly miscued at the end of a performance that took him back to the dark days before his recent resurgence. Then, in the dying seconds as Rashford carried the ball through the Leicester defence and the goal beckoned, he was kicked from behind by his own player coming from an offside position. That moment of calamity and the final whistle that soon followed was greeted with silence by an Old Trafford crowd too apathetic by now to boo. The sooner the season finishes and United appoint their new manager, the better. For Rashford and for Rangnick.   ",positive,liverpool,0

The 29-year-old was part of the Red Devils squad who underwhelmed in a 1-0 loss to Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday, coming off the bench in the second half. Defeat to the Toffees saw United’s hopes of finishing in the top four this season take another blow with Ralf Rangnick’s side now six points off fourth-placed Tottenham. Man Utd won’t improve unless they drop two players, Arteta out and… Pogba looks set to leave Man Utd at the end of the season with his contract running out in the summer and Beckford thinks he would be better suited to another league. “Players like Paul Pogba have come in to Manchester United for humongous money,” Beckford toldStadium Astro. “I’m one of his biggest fans because technically he’s one of the best in the world. I just don’t think he’s suited to Premier League football where the pace of the game is very quick and intense. “A lot of money has been spent at United but in the wrong areas and on the wrong players, and that’s something they need to look at going forward. “I think Pogba will leave [in the summer] and that will be the right decision because we’ve seen how good he is atJuventusand with France – that’s the player I want to see but I don’t think we will see that at United. I think he’ll leave for those reasons.” When asked if Pogba’s time at Man Utd had been a failure, fellow pundit Rene Meulensteen replied: “Failure is a big word but has Pogba lived up to the expectations? I don’t think so. “He knew what the expectations were when he came back, to compete for the Premier League and the Champions League. “Not everything has clicked with the players around him or the system, does he actually suit the Premier League? “What frustrated me a little bit is Paul has never really outspoken his commitment to United. He’s never came out there and said he’s going to stay and bring United back to where they belong. “There’s always been issues over his future and that doesn’t sit well with the fans. It’s not just one player though, there’s many more issues that need to be addressed before United are going to get back on the right track. “Since he’s come back it hasn’t really happened for him or Manchester United. I think he will leave now.” ",positive,liverpool,0

There have been rumours circulating that Rashford could look to leave Old Trafford after being left on the bench in recent weeks. The England international was left out of the Red Devils starting XI for their 1-1 home draw against Leicester City last weekend despite Rangnick not having any other recognised strikers to call upon. Ten Hag or anyone else will need a miracle with this Man Utd… Rangnick did chuck him into the line-up to face Everton yesterday, though, but decided to haul him off on 64 minutes, to the disbelief of Murphy and Wright. Murphy said on BBC’s Match of the Day: “Today he did not deserve to be taken off. “Wrighty and I were gobsmacked when he came off, there were other players on the pitch who weren’t contributing. From minute one he was trying to make things happen. “He was getting himself in central areas and in a game where United were struggling to create, he was the one trying to run in behind with his pace.” Fellow pundit Wright added: “I couldn’t believe it. “It’s one of those where we always knew he would be up against it with everything he’s done off the field. It gives people fuel to say ‘you should be concentrating on football’. “He’s going through a bad patch of form but it happens. The manager hasn’t worked at Manchester United so it will be interesting to see what they do in the summer.” Rangnick thought Anthony Gordon’s strike for Everton, which was the only goal of the game, turned the tide of the match against Man Utd. “The first 25 minutes we were in full control of the game,” Rangnick said after the match. “We didn’t even in those 25 minutes take enough and make enough advantage out of that dominating period in the game. “You could literally feel that they were crumbling after that result against Burnley, they were quite logically not full of confidence but we didn’t take advantage of that and with their first shot on goal, it changed the game and changed the atmosphere in the stadium. “In the second half they just defended with all their outfield players on the pitch and we were not able to break that wall down in the second half.” ",negative,liverpool,0

Rashford has not scored since January and wasted his start against Everton on Saturday, failing to score before being hooked after 64 pretty poor minutes of a 1-0 defeat. The United forward has scored only four Premier League goals this season and has rarely looked comfortable anywhere across the front three. There are some suggestions that he could reject the offer of a new contract and move elsewhere in an attempt t0 revive his career but Ferdinand insists he needs to see stability at United. “It has left me worried. I’m asking a lot of questions of what is going on behind the scenes, and I think that every young player does it,” said Ferdinand on BT Sport. “He has slumped shoulders, not looking as confident. When Marcus Rashford burst onto the scene, you thought ”Oh my god, this kid”. It’s like Roy of the Rovers – he is going to do what he wants in the game. “I think a lot of that [lack of confidence] stems from the uncertainty of the football club. He’s a local boy that is desperate for this football club to do well – he grew up on success.That’s all he has ever known as a kid, that’s all he has watched. To be in this situation, I know it hurts him.” When asked what he meant by uncertainty, Ferdinand said: “The uncertainty in terms of the manager, even contract, I think he has been offered a contract but he is probably sitting there thinking ‘I don’t even know who the next manager is. This manager hasn’t played me as much as I like to and when he has played me, he has played me out of position as well’. “In time he will understand sometimes you have to go to put on a show for people that might not necessarily show how you feel at that time.’ “There is no doubt, the talent is there.

There have been rumours that the England international is thinking about leaving Old Trafford over a lack of belief from interim boss Ralf Rangnick with his career at Man Utd stalling Rashford came back from time out following shoulder surgery on fire with three goals in his first four matches of this campaign. Gossip: Man Utd prioritise Leeds star, rival Liverpool for winger However, that is as good as it has got for the 24-year-old, who has scored just twice in his last 23 outings in all competitions for Man Utd. With Cristiano Ronaldo and Edinson Cavani injured for their match against Leicester City at the weekend, Rangnick still decided to leave Rashford on the bench despite having no recognisable striker to call upon. But The Sun claims that Man Utd ‘chiefs hope to convince Marcus Rashford to stay — and reignite his career at Old Trafford’ despite his relationship with the club hitting a ‘new low’ on Saturday. Rashford has ‘considered quittingUnited’ with Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid all understood to be interested if he does leave. However, the report adds that Man Utd have ‘stressed that they still value Rashford’ and they have told any new manager that they want him as part of the club’s plans moving forward. A source told The Sun: “Marcus is having a really tough time this season — especially in the games where he has not started even though United didn’t have another striker available. “It’s happened a couple of times, so he is concerned that Ralf Rangnick just doesn’t fancy him. “But the club have let him know that the contenders for the manager’s job have told them that he is a vital asset to the club — and would still figure strongly in their plans to rebuild. So now Marcus is just staying calm.” Meanwhile, Rangnick spoke after the match against Leicester about Rashford’s struggles and has urged the England forward to “take the steps himself” to return to form. “Marcus, it’s no secret that he is not having his best time right now,” Rangnick said. “It has to do with rhythm and confidence, it’s our job to help him to get this confidence back. “The only thing we can do is speak to him regularly and tell him what we expect from him and what he should do. The rest has to be done by himself. “It is possible to develop within a couple of weeks a level of confidence where you can be a different player again. “We all know that Marcus can play better, but in the end he has to take the steps himself.”  ",positive,liverpool,1
140,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-everton-1-0-man-utd-ten-hag-rangnick-pochettino,Ten Hag or anyone else will need a miracle with this Man Utd…,"Erik ten Hag or Mauricio Pochettino? Unless either of the prospective Manchester United managers can demonstrate a proficiency in sorcery, it hardly matters. That was evident yet again when the Red Devils went to Everton and chucked in the battle of the banter clubs. With these players, this dearth of character, this shameful lack of motivation, this half-arsed hierarchy, what chance has any new manager got? Any United fans pinning their hopes on either Ten Hag or Pochettino riding into Manchester to straighten out such a chaotically assembled squad is kidding themselves. Ten Hag reportedly proposed a five-year plan to rebuild the football club. On recent evidence, the Ajax coach could be written off as a dreamer; he will need ten. To say that the defeat to Everton is their worst performance of the season – the reaction on many on social media in the immediate aftermath of the final whistle at Goodison Park – perhaps feeds off a hearty portion of recency bias. Because United have played as hopelessly as that on a few occasions this season. And last season. And each time it gets harder to stomach, for the United fans who’ve fought the notion that their team is comprised largely of bluffers, and the neutrals scarcely able to fathom what this great club has become. So often have the players revealed their barely-concealed disdain for the travelling supporters that this result, to a team deep in the mire and themselves lacking the necessary bollocks, comes as no surprise. To an Everton side, pinned by Sean Dyche this week as one that ‘don’t know how to win’, the sight of the United circus rolling in to town must have been manna from heaven. Early winners: Everton back to f***ing basics and b*llocks The Toffees, themselves a shambles from top to bottom, at least had a cause to fight for. United did too – the top four – but you wouldn’t know it. Not from their intensity here, or last week at home to a Leicester side who spent the first hour waiting to beaten before they realised: “Lads, it Man Utd.” It took Everton and their fans just under half an hour to catch on too. Few grounds can be as intense as Goodison but initially it was just tense, which is understandable given what the home supporters have been subjected to by Frank Lampard’s side of late. United did not even need to quieten the crowd because the Toffees have spent the last few weeks doing that for them. Nor did it seem that it was the Everton players who geed up the Gwladys Street, more that Evertonians sussed that, actually, United really are as bad as reports had suggested. As if they couldn’t quite believe it without seeing for themselves. The opening goal, of course, swelled that belief among the Goodison faithful. And, of course, it came as a consequence of United failing to perform their basic tasks. Nemanja Matic, seemingly wading through quicksand all afternoon, failed to scan upon receiving the ball in midfield and gave up possession far too easily; Aaron Wan-Bissaka tracked back an overhit pass for Richarlison with his customary apathy whenever there is no prospect of a slide tackle; Matic offered an impression of a tackle to deny Alex Iwobi; before Anthony Gordon’s shot found the net via the shell of Harry Maguire. For the remaining hour, United did what they do best. They pretended. They pretended to attack, pretended to tackle, pretended to care. But there was no disguising their lack of intent. We could pick on individuals, but what’s the point? Every technical, tactical and mental deficiency has been nit-picked already on these pages and there was no new or interesting conclusion to draw aside from to question how far a group of players can actually drift. Like last week, this performance simply served to reaffirm every pessimistic view of these United players, with Ralf Rangnick surely more gloomy than anyone of their prospects. The interim manager has carried the air of a man who can scarcely believe what he is witnessing on a daily basis and the German called it on Friday: “Game plan and tactics is one thing tomorrow but the other thing, and probably the most important thing, is mentality, attitude, physicality.” The message, evidently, is yet to pierce the bubble these United players reside in.  Yes, some will go. Not enough since the club is still obliged to field 11 players on the opening day of next season, but there will be a clear-out of sorts. There has to be. United finished with a midfield of Juan Mata and Paul Pogba, both of whom are counting down the days to the end of their contractual obligations. Jesse Lingard too will be off and many of their team-mates will watch with envy as they skip towards the door. For Marcus Rashford, once more it looked like the novelty of playing for his boyhood club has vanished, while Wan-Bissaka appears to know that he can’t get away with it for much longer. But Pochettino or, more likely, Ten Hag will still have to work with many of these players, under these owners. For both, it’s not yet too late to block Richard Arnold’s phone number.

141,https://www.football365.com/news/premier-league-xis-aguero-2011-12,Premier League XIs: Aguero and the headliners of 2011/12,"Here are the headliners for the 2011/12 season, when the neighbours became more than noisy… Goalkeeper: David de Gea After the retirement of legendary goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar, Manchester United signed highly rated 20-year-old ‘keeper David de Gea from Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2011. As the Red Devils’ new number one, the Spaniard’s performances were put under the media microscope and although he produced a number of fine displays, his mistakes made the headlines. A heavy, morale-sapping 6-1 defeat to rivals Manchester City did little to inspire confidence and questions were raised surrounding De Gea’s long-term suitability at Old Trafford.  Right-back: Kyle Walker Tottenham Hotspur qualified for the Champions League again after finishing in fourth spot in the 2011/12 season. Young right-back Kyle Walker was one of the standout performers of the campaign, with the Yorkshire-born defender winning the PFA Young Player of the Year award as well as earning his first England cap in the November of ’11. He won the affection of the White Hart Lane crowd with a blistering winner against Arsenal but unfortunately for Tottenham fans, manager Harry Redknapp’s ongoing legal trial and speculation linking him to the England job overshadowed an otherwise promising season.  Centre-back: John Terry The position of England manager became vacant in 2012 due to the resignation of Fabio Capello, with the Italian stepping down after the FA stripped John Terry of his national team captaincy. The Chelsea defender made the headlines for all the wrong reasons after allegations of racist language towards Anton Ferdinand in a match against QPR, with the situation causing a headache for new England boss Roy Hodgson at Euro 2012. Anton’s brother Rio was controversially left out of the squad, whilst Terry was included. The full-kit shenanigans in the Champions League final did little to improve his public image either, with Terry appearing in his Chelsea shirt, shorts and socks despite being suspended.  Centre-back: Vincent Kompany The title-winning captain and Premier League Player of the season, Vincent Kompany became the first of his countrymen to win the competition in the 2011/12 season. The Belgian’s leadership proved vital, especially after former captain Carlos Tevez’s refusal to play against Bayern Munich in the Champions League. The Argentinean forward’s subsequent golfing sojourn made the headlines and threatened to de-rail City’s season but the side rallied and capitalised on Manchester United’s slip-up late in the season to win the Premier League title in the most dramatic fashion possible. Kompany is top 3 of all time captain in the PL, always turned up when needed. His goal against Man U in 2012 and Leicester last season are among most iconic the league has seen. — gaydb (@fuckUEFA_) June 15, 2020   Left-back: Gael Givet Blackburn Rovers defender Gael Givet and Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba both suffered heart-related scares during the 2011/12 season. Muamba’s collapse in an FA Cup quarter-final match was particularly harrowing, with the former Arsenal youngster nearly losing his life. Givet underwent surgery to correct his heart palpitations and returned to the side but he could do little to stop Rovers dropping into the Championship. The Ewood Park faithful expressed their anger at owners Venky’s and manager Steve Kean throughout the campaign and their worst fears were confirmed after a 1-0 defeat to relegation rivals Wigan in May. Bolton also went down after a decade in the top flight.  Central midfield: Stiliyan Petrov Aston Villa captain Stiliyan Petrov was sadly diagnosed with leukaemia early in 2012 and began to receive treatment straight away. The Bulgarian struggled with the gruelling chemotherapy sessions but thankfully made a full recovery and later returned to Villa Park in a coaching capacity. On the pitch, Villa had a terrible 2011/12 season, with new manager and former Birmingham boss Alex McLeish proving to be an unpopular choice. The side stayed narrowly avoided relegation, despite not winning any of their last ten games.  Central midfield: Joe Allen 2011 came to end with football still in shock over the tragic death of Wales manager and Premier League legend Gary Speed. Swansea’s match with Aston Villa went ahead after news of his death broke, with several members of Speed’s Welsh team appearing in the game. Swans midfielder Joe Allen had lined up for Speed whilst on national team duty and impressed throughout the team’s debut season in the Premier League. Club manager Brendan Rodgers also received praise for his work and departed for Liverpool at the end of the season, taking Allen with him to Anfield.  Central midfield: Steven Gerrard Following the controversy surrounding John Terry, Steven Gerrard captained England at Euro 2012. The Three Lions lost out on penalties against Italy in the quarter-finals, despite Gerrard successfully converting his spot-kick in the shoot-out. The Merseyside-born midfielder didn’t fare so well in the League Cup final, seeing his penalty superbly saved by Tom Heaton after the game had ended 2-2. Luckily for Gerrard, his own cousin missed a decisive kick for the Bluebirds later in the shoot-out, meaning Liverpool won the match.  Striker: Didier Drogba Despite getting his hands on the League Cup trophy, Steven Gerrard missed out on lifting the FA Cup after Didier Drogba bagged the winner for Chelsea against Liverpool in a 2-1 win for the Blues at Wembley. The Ivorian striker yet again proved himself to be the man for the big occasions after scoring against Bayern Munich in the Champions League Final. Chelsea’s rollercoaster ride to the European showpiece saw them miraculously overcome Napoli and Barcelona in the knockout rounds, before meeting the German giants. Drogba’s equalising goal sent the match into extra-time and penalties were required to decide a champion. No prizes for guessing who scored the winning spot-kick. Eight years ago on this very day Chelsea became the ONLY London club to win the Champions League. Did Chelsea get lucky at times? 100%. But Cech’s heroics & Drogba’s last minute header will never be forgotten May 19th 2012 is when London truly became blue.. pic.twitter.com/uj73WGTMhV — Conn (@ConnCFC) May 19, 2020   Striker: Robin van Persie Chelsea became the first London club to lift the Champions League trophy after their victory in Germany, leaving Arsenal fans with plenty to be upset about in the 2011/12 season. A humiliating 8-2 defeat to Manchester United early on in the campaign led to questions over Arsene Wenger’s future as boss, with matters made worse after dramatic losses against Blackburn Rovers and local rivals Tottenham. Robin van Persie’s form kept the Gunners in contention though, with the Dutchman finishing as the Premier League’s top scorer and bagging the PFA and FWA Player of the Year awards for his outstanding form. However, he wasn’t going to be a hero at the Emirates for much longer.  Striker: Sergio Aguero No-one needs reminding of why this man made the headlines in 2011/12, right?

142,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-16-conclusions-man-city-0-1-chelsea-guardiola-tuchel-mount-havertz,16 Conclusions: Man City 0-1 Chelsea,"Pep Guardiola gave Thomas Tuchel a gift before kick-off and he and Chelsea gratefully unwrapped it to win the Champions League. 1) It was so comfortable. That’s a statement you thought could only be made after a Manchester City win. They’ve got the best coach in the world, they’ve got the best squad in the world, they finished 19 points clear of the team they were playing in the Premier League. It was a game lost on the field, but one swayed hugely before any boots touched the grass. Guardiola did another nonsense, Tuchel stuck to his principles and the favourites became the underdogs when the teams were announced. No holding midfielder? It was baffling.  2) City had one shot on target, in the eighth minute. Save a couple of crosses across the face of Chelsea’s goal and two blocked Phil Foden shots, they created nothing. Chelsea defended expertly. The back five, the two holders and the three forwards were so tightly packed, forcing City into wide areas towards the Blues full-backs, who were impeccable. But still, we expected far more. Yes, Guardiola will be blamed and rightly so, but Riyad Mahrez, Bernardo Silva, Kevin De Bruyne and Ilkay Gundogan were all way off it, while Chelsea – to a man – were brilliant.  3) Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard – the Champions League final has a rich history of very good English midfielders. But none of them are like Mason Mount and Phil Foden: these boys are a new breed. The aforementioned were – and this is admittedly a bit of a generalisation – box-to-box midfielders. Some qualities were more pronounced than those of their counterparts, but they were the best of your typical English midfield general. Power, grind and effort were their enviable qualities, while praise for intricacy and touch was reserved for those from a more southerly latitude. Before Xavi or one of his millions of Paul Scholes-based spokespeople gets in touch, the Manchester United man was a bit different – less blood and guts; more finesse. ButevenScholes didn’t have the attacking influence that Mount and Foden have on Chelsea and Manchester City. Without them, it – whatever it is – simply doesn’t work. It’s amazing enough to be playing in a Champions League final as a kid from the academy of one of these teams: among the most free-spending in the world. But for Man City and Chelsea – whose starting lineups cost £453million and £307million respectively – to turn to this pair, who cost precisely £0, to win them the very biggest of games, is truly incredible. English midfielders used to make football look like a war, but for these guys it’s a game. And what a pleasure it is to think of people from across the Channel watching them and worrying, not that they’ll be outfought by them, but outplayed.  4) ‘No DM’ was the trend, an indication of the key talking point ahead of kick-off, rather than a mass effort from one half of Twitter to prevent the other half from sending unwelcome X-rated messages. Guardiola has been predictable enough this season to make the decision not to start Fernandinho or Rodri a genuine surprise. This was just the second game of 60 this season in which neither of them has started – the other was against Olympiacos. Joleon Lescott was perplexed in the BT Sport studio and Joe Cole became more cockney with excitement at what he – and surely all Chelsea fans – suspected was a welcome increase in their odds ahead of kick-off. “You have to shake,” Pep Guardiola said in an interview with Rio Ferdinando, referring to the need to adapt to grow over a period of time rather than his penchant for unexpected tactical decisions. This “shake” made City look shaky.  5) Timo Werner should have scored twice in the opening 15 minutes. He was excellent in everything until the key moment, as is his wont. He snatched at and completely missed a pull-back from Ben Chilwell, before getting the ball caught under his feet to spurn another great chance moments later. But he got in behind Kyle Walker and Oleksandr Zinchenko continously. That ball was always on and Ruben Dias and, in particular, John Stones, did not look comfortable being pulled so frequently from the middle of the pitch. And Werner’s run was a huge factor in the goal. Dias went with the German’s wide dummy run, to open up a massive gap between him and Zinchenko. KaiHavertz’s run was nothing special, in fact it was downright simple. It was really poor from Zinchenko, who could see Havertz the entire time and did nothing to get goalside of him, leaving the Chelsea man to round Ederson and stroke into an empty net. It was the classic combination of a moment of real quality from one side and negligence from the other.  6) The quality came from Mount. He had far too much time and space, and finding it was too easy – more on that shortly – but there is no Chelsea player better equipped to play that pass. There may not be another Chelsea player able to play that pass. What a season he’s had. This is the customary point at which credit is given to Frank Lampard. And yes, he took him to Derby and put him in the first team at Chelsea. But is anyone really watching Mount right now thinking he would not have made it were it not for Lampard? His rise may have been boosted slightly and Mount himself will no doubt feel he’s indebted to his former manager.But Tuchel saw italmostimmediately, as any manager would. He is one of the best midfielders in Europe and credit shouldn’t be doled out willy-nilly when it’s Mount himself who’s had to battle through the academy to get to this stage. Splitting the merit diminishes what is almost solely his achievement.  7) What must Gundogan have been thinking as Guardiola put up the teamsheet? I’m going to get my pants pulled down here? Or something less PG. The plan was for him to be the deepest midfielder, to enable Manchester City to have as many between-the-lines footballers on the pitch as possible, in the knowledge that the gaps between those lines would be paper thin. But putting more bodies in those central areas doesn’t widen those gaps and through playing Gundogan over either Fernandinho or Rodri in that role, City were not only left with a lack of defensive solidity, but also suffered through their top goalscorer being nowhere near the opposition goal. Fernandinho eventually came on for Bernardo Silva – who was useless – to enable Gundogan to push on, but it was too late. Chelsea were in front and had firmly retreated into their shell, which has proven to be impenetrable time and again under Tuchel.  8) The way through was blocked; the way round was the only option. Reece James and Ben Chilwell were very good, but City did get in on both sides a couple of times, through those neat one-twos and the speed of Sterling and Kyle Walker. But this team has an understandable reticence to play in that manner. The two occasions the ball was passed across the six yard box, there was no-one on the end of it. Chelsea covered those spaces brilliantly, but if there was ever a game that City missed a proper striker, this was it. Their six attacking midfielders, wingers, no.10s – whatever you want to call them – were almost laughably ineffective. Chelsea were almost urging them to take the ball and pass the ball in those tight spaces, in the knowledge that N’Golo Kante would be there to nip it away from them, or Antonio Rudiger, Andreas Christensen and Cesar Azpilicueta would be a couple of metres away if Kante failed. Ha, Kante failing, what an absurd notion.  9) The guy is ridiculous. Chelsea’s former diminutive Frenchman, Claude Makelele, had a position named after him. That would be a pointless exercise with Kante. No-one else does or is likely ever to be able to play ‘the Kante role’. His hit-rate for tackles is sensational, his energy, of course, knows no bounds and his speed with and without the ball is remarkable. He’s a sniffer and a snuffer: working out where the ball is going to go and taking the best path to win it back. It felt like he was man-marking all six of City’s forward players. He was supposedly injured in the lead-up to this game, FFS. And English fans watching this, buoyed by the performances of Mount, James and – to a lesser extent – Foden, ahead of Euro 2020, would do well to remember that it’s really the only big trophy left for Kante to win. And who would bet against him snaffling that one up, like he does everything else.  10) The goal was lovely from Chelsea. Mount’s pass, Havertz’s finish, Mendy’s initial floated ball out to Chilwell and the left-back’s cushioned lay-off for Mount. It was all very neat, very tidy, with – as said already – one moment of magic. But back to poor Gundogan and the lack of a midfield buddy. Mount is an expert in finding space to operate in, but he needed none of that expertise. He just collected the ball after two touches from Mendy and Chilwell, looked up and saw no-one around him. Stones half went with Mount and then realised his absence from the backline was a problem. It wasn’t great from him, it wasn’t great from any of them. But what did Guardiola expect? They don’t know how to play this way and he chose the biggest game in the history of the football club to what?! Try it out? If I was in that Manchester City dressing room after the game, I would be angry with one man, the manager. It’s his fault they lost.  11) What is it with Guardiola? Arrogance? A desire to be heralded not purely as a genius, but a flawed, troubled one? He was very gracious in defeat and was understandably not keen to talk tactics after losing the game. But it would be great to hear him explain himself at some point. It’s not as though Chelsea’s forward players have clearly defined roles. If anything, Tuchel’s front trios are famous for interchanging their positions, making it very difficult before the game for an opposition coach to point to Mount, Havertz or Werner and assign them to one player or another. That’s why youhaveto play a defensive midfielder. Rodri has been great all season and Fernandinho was superb in the semi-final win over Paris Saint-Germain. Even if Guardiola does explain, there is nothing he could say that would make that decision seem anything but downright daft.  12) Raheem Sterling was also a surprise starter: he had played just ten minutes across the four quarter-final and semi-final legs. But his worth was made clear very early on. With the ball at Ederson’s feet, Sterling ran in front and behind Reece James, who wouldn’t have caught him had the forward’s control been better. It was a really entertaining battle between Sterling and James. It was clearly a ploy for City to test the young right-back; a lot of the probing – particularly in the first half – came down that side. But James ensured the probing never became full penetration. Whenever it looked as though Sterling had got the better of him, James outmuscled, outpaced or outplayed him. If the Chelsea right-back wasn’t already in Gareth Southgate’s starting XI, he probably is now.  13) And on the other flank, Ben Chilwell put in his best performance in a Chelsea shirt. Apart from a couple of his dramatic, pathetic falls to the ground at the slightest touch, he was excellent. Linking up with Mount, getting forward whenever possible and dealing with Mahrez with a stunning minimum of fuss. The Man City winger is one of the trickiest customers around, but other than his last-minute fluffed shot which had Chelsea hearts in mouths, he did nothing of note. It could easily be a Chelsea full-back pair for England.  14) If there was a surprise selection from Tuchel, and as surprises go it would be akin to a balloon popping unexpectedly compared to Pep driving a car through the wall of your front room, it was Havertz’s place in the side over Christian Pulisic or Hakim Ziyech. The German didn’t start the FA Cup final or the recent Premier League games against West Ham, Man City or Leicester, i.e. the big games. His talent is unquestionable and he is such a gliding, effortless joy. His spatial awareness is really wonderful and he takes one touch to beat a man where others would take three or four. He’s deceptively quick, decent in the air and runs a hell of a lot. That goal is worth the £72million alone, of course, but Chelsea will get a hell of a lot more bang for their buck next season. He’s 21 and very, very good at football.   15) Thomas Tuchel had lost four and drawn one against Pep Guardiola before he joined Chelsea. And even though he had won both of the previous games against him this season as Chelsea boss, team strength caveats were fairly pointed out by the detractors, to make what were very impressive wins not as impressive as they could have been. Four of City’s front six on Saturday – Ilkay Gundogan, Bernardo Silva, Riyad Mahrez and Phil Foden – didn’t start either of the two previous games.Yes, Chelsea won, but it wasn’t therealCity. And it’s possible to claim – due to their sub-par performance level – that this wasn’t either. But this was at least supposed to be the best of Manchester City, the best team in Europe. And Tuchel’s team were so much better than them. “If you sign for Chelsea you sign for the hunger of titles,” Tuchel said in his first Chelsea press conference. “You sign for being absolutely competitive in every competition you play.” And that “hunger” is so evident in him but also in his players. They didn’t have that under Lampard. They didn’t really have tactics or a game plan either, which Tuchel implemented almost immediately and is now totally ingrained in the team and the whole squad, but it’s the desire that’s most impressive. His squad is nearly as good as Manchester City’s and what will be scary for Guardiola, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Jurgen Klopp is the fact that many of Chelsea’s forward players have got nowhere near their potential this season. The ceiling for this club under his management is very high indeed. What an unbelievable job he’s done.  16) It was a horrible final for City. Losing is tough; not turning up is devastating. But what a moment for Chelsea, who again sacked their manager mid-season – a club legend at that – in their insatiable search for silverware. And what a night for the Chelsea fans, who get a second taste of European glory, one very different to the first. 2012 was the end of an era – the end of John Terry, Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba.But what a way this is to start another one. This was the making of Mount, the coming of Kai. Welcome to Tuchel time.  ",positive,liverpool,0
143,https://www.football365.com/news/eternal-delights-of-football-outfield-players-in-goal,Eternal delights of football: Outfield players in goal,"Overpaid players. Sunday lunchtime kick-offs. Absurd ticket prices. Non-black boots. Football’s menu of perceived ills is long. Where has the joy gone? Why do we bother?Saturday, 3pm by Daniel Grayoffers a glorious antidote. It is here to remind you that football can still sing to your heart. We brought you Gray on watching an away end eruptandthe wonderof the slide tackle and they are just twooffifty short essays of prose poetry dedicated to what is good in the game.Lastly, for us (buy the book), it’s outfield players in goal. The substitute goalkeeper leads a lonely life. He is only called upon when something goes wrong – a paramedic in a number 13 shirt – and exists as something of a legal obligation. Even when he is outsourced by way of a loan to a smaller club, it is to fill in for someone else and then return home, a row added to his appearances panel on Wikipedia. The loan club’s manager will probably have saluted his ‘professionalism’, but still the bench beckons once more. Then one afternoon his fellow goalkeeper is clattered while rising to pluck a corner from the air. He is told to warm up. He stretches and wishes concussion – just a mild one – upon his teammate. The sign is given, off comes his tracksuit and on he sprints, stopping by the number one’s stretcher to check there is definitely no pulse. I should be happy for him, the patient understudy finally giving us his Hamlet. And yet I resent him. I resent him because the very existence of the substitute goalkeeper has half-ruined one of football’s perfect diversions. There is nowadays very little call for an outfield player to go in goal. Instances are rare since some bureaucrat, blind to slapstick, created an emergency service by allowing far too many substitutes. However, there are just enough circumstances to make the scenario plausible, if unlikely, and so well worth crossing your fingers for: a sent-off goalkeeper followed by an injured one; no substitutions left to make; or no goalkeeper on the bench. All such cataclysms of misfortune can lead to this spectacle. Roll up, roll up for the cabaret. If this unusual firework is lit, the atmosphere in the ground will be crackling. All the better if an injustice has caused the anomaly – from adversity comes volume. When the candidate emerges – ‘He’s always mucking about in goal at training,’ you hear in post-match interviews – the first part of the performance can begin. For some reason, a goalkeeper’s shirt is always too big for an outfield player. It flaps baggily in the wind, and laps towards the ends of his shorts. He pulls on gloves drenched heavy by sweat, yanking the Velcro wrist straps tight with his mouth, and only then begins to tuck in his shirt. It is like shoving a flag into a drain and when he is finished, he still resembles a schoolboy dressed from the lost-property box. Once he has jumped up to demonstrate – to himself as much as anyone else – that he can reach the crossbar, play can begin. Often, an outfield player in goal’s first act is to face a penalty. This means a prompt opportunity to witness his diving style. There will be plenty more as opponents sniff fear and blood. That style is usually exaggerated rather than controlled. He is a civilian throwing himself on an unexploded bomb. He seems to move like a child’s lost helium balloon, zigzagging wildly according to the whims of a gust. Elbows and knees are engaged, jazz hands rigid. Some shots fly by him, many more hit various spots on his body and cannon against the bar or out for a corner. Nothing is of greater use to the outfield player in goal than the kick-save. ‘Use your hands!’ the crowd cry as they did at reluctant street keepers in childhood. He rarely will. It is a basic reflex for him, even if he looks as though he is being controlled by strings from above. The whole episode makes for chaotic, unbridled fun. It reminds us that all footballers are descendants of 25-a-side contests in the park. The frolics of these have-a-go heroes rekindle in everyone, on and off pitch, a childlike, raw love of the game.

144,https://www.football365.com/news/benzema-tears-chelsea-apart-real-madrid-perfect-hat-trick,Benzema tears Chelsea apart with a *real* perfect hat-trick,"Karim Benzema was the spearhead of a majestic Real Madrid display against a suddenly out-of-sorts Chelsea. The 13-time champions stormed Stamford Bridge to place one foot firmly in the semi-finals. People often talk of “perfect hat-tricks”, by which they – quite wrongly – mean one comprising a goal scored with each of the head, left foot and right foot. Then there are “German hat-tricks”, which (to my mind needlessly) place extra restrictions on what counts as a proper hat-trick by insisting they must be three consecutive goals scored within the same half. The logical extension of those twin daftnesses is the Perfect German hat-trick. Left-footed, right-footed and headed goals scored without any other goals or a half-time whistle interrupting. At this point you’re raising the difficulty tariff to something approaching cricket’s version of the achievement. But it’s all tish and fipsy. Because the perfect hat-trick was scored tonight at Stamford Bridge by Karim Benzema. Two brilliant goals and a comical one is definitely the best kind of hat-trick. It was also his second consecutive hat-trick in the competition having turned the PSG tie on its head in the last 16. Having emerged from Cristiano Ronaldo’s shadows to become indisputably Real Madrid’s main man he is on Ballon d’Or-winning form right now. More importantly, it’s potentially Champions League-winning form. His first two goals were magnificent, both absurdly difficult and very different headers sent arcing beyond a despairing Edouard Mendy. Key to both, beyond Benzema’s exemplary movement and finishing, was the quality of delivery. The first was created by the equally excellent Vinicius Junior, whose pacy delivery from the left allowed Benzema to get enough on the ball to find the top corner from a good 14 yards out.  Then Luka Modric – the second former Spurs schemer to have a lovely old time at Stamford Bridge this week – curled in a beauty from the right which Benzema almost just let hit him on the head and rebound back inside the post. It was reminiscent of a couple of goals at the old White Hart Lane, actually. One scored against Spurs by Edin Dzeko, one by Harry Kane against Arsenal a few years later. But it was better than both, marked out by the freakish apparent effortlessness of it all. It was surely the greatest header anyone at Stamford Bridge had seen for, ooh, a good three minutes. Chelsea at this point were also, it should be noted, a shambles. Madrid’s midfield three had seized full control of the pitch and both Vinicius and Benzema had more than served notice of their threat before the goals came. Chelsea, four days after an embarrassing defeat to Brentford, were being overrun again. Real Madrid are very much like Brentford in many ways. Yet they still got to half-time with a foothold. Kai Havertz – once again proving himself Chelsea’s man for the big occasion – pulled one back with a fine headed goal of his own. Definitely the best headed goal to be only the third best headed goal of the half. FACT. Thomas Tuchel looked to grab the lifeline with significant half-time changes. Off went Andreas Christensen to spare him any more torment from Vinicius. More contentiously but also perfectly understandably based on the evidence of the 45 minutes that had just gone, so too did N’Golo Kante. On came Mateo Kovacic and Hakim Ziyech. This was bold stuff, and it was to Tuchel’s credit that he saw Havertz’s goal before the break as an opportunity but not vindication. Maybe those changes could have turned the tie back in Chelsea’s favour. We’ll never know, because then came the calamity Chelsea’s play had threatened. Mendy left a routine short pass to Antonio Rudiger short. Rudiger, already on a booking, didn’t commit to tackling the onrushing Real Madrid player which was, of course, Benzema and the rest was a formality. Two great goals, one stupid one, and Benzema became only the fourth player to score consecutive Champions League hat-tricks, joining Luiz Adriano and the two you’ve already guessed. That was already more than enough narrative and action for one night, but there was still time for more. Romelu Lukaku came on and touched the ball four times. Two of those touches were headers from which he really should have scored to at least reduce Chelsea’s deficit and offer a slim chance of pulling something out of the fire in Madrid. The contrast from Benzema’s first-half masterclass could not have been more stark. The elite striker at the peak of his powers, and the one struggling desperately to relocate his spark.

Jurgen Klopp is gunning for an unprecedented Quadruple, while Pep Guardiola is hoping to lead his team to the Treble.

Goalkeeper: Fabian Carini Twenty years ago, Arsenal claimed a third Double after going on a 13-game winning streak to clinch the league title and beat pre-Abramovich era Chelsea in the FA Cup final. However, a maiden Champions League crown evaded the Gunners as they crashed out of the competition in the much-maligned second group phase. Arsene Wenger’s men faced Juventus in the final match and as the Bianconeri had already been eliminated they fielded a weakened team. But back-up keeper Fabian Carini made the most of a rare start, saving a Thierry Henry penalty to keep the match at 0-0, before a late Marcelo Zalayeta goal ended Arsenal’s Treble chances. If you fancy a goalkeeper challenge, try naming the Deportivo keeper who saved a penalty from Henry a week before the Juventus game.  Centre-back: Gerry Ryan Versatile Irishman Gerry Ryan will have to a do a job at centre-back for this side, with the former Brighton man playing a part in halting Liverpool’s bid for a Quadruple in 1984. Ryan also found the back of net in 1983 to help the Seagulls knock out the Reds en route to the FA Cup final and despite suffering relegation in the same year, the south coast side proved to be a thorn in Liverpool’s side as a second-tier team, with Ryan scoring again as Joe Fagan’s men exited the cup in the fourth round. It proved to be the only blot on their campaign: the Anfield faithful went on to watch their heroes lift the First Division title, League Cup and European Cup.  Centre-back: Daniel Agger Chelsea’s 2011/12 season will be remembered for a remarkable run to the Champions League final and the big-game heroics of Didier Drogba that helped the Blues to an unlikely triumph in Europe. Caretaker boss Roberto Di Matteo had already guided his players to FA Cup glory against Liverpool – a victory that contained an element of revenge. Kenny Dalglish’s team were the only side in the Premier League to do the double over Chelsea that year, with Daniel Agger scoring in a 4-1 win for the Reds in May, denying the Stamford Bridge outfit a chance at making the top four.   Centre-back: Phil Jagielka Ten years after their Treble triumph in 1999, Manchester United looked to be on course for going one better after beating Tottenham on penalties in the 2009 League Cup final. Despite leading his side to a Champions League final for the second year in a row and adding another Premier League title to his vast collection, Sie Alex Ferguson was left furious after watching his players blow their Quadruple chances following a penalty shootout defeat to Everton in the semis of the FA Cup. Phil Jagielka converted the winning spot-kick and to make matters worse for United, the Everton defender had earlier gotten away with what looked to have been a clear foul on Danny Welbeck in the box.  Right-wing: Kai Havertz Last year it was the blue side of Manchester gunning for a Quadruple but Chelsea twice thwarted Pep Guardiola’s lofty ambitions. The League Cup and the Premier League crown both ended up at the Etihad but defeat in the FA Cup semis to Thomas Tuchel’s men was followed up by a loss in Europe to the same side. Kai Havertz scored the only goal in Porto as Manchester City came out second-best in their first Champions League final, while the result also extended Guardiola’s drought in the competition to ten years.  Central midfield: Jimmy Greenhoff If Liverpool can defeat Manchester City on Sunday and find a way past the Citizens in their FA Cup clash the following weekend, Manchester United will be the next obstacle facing Jurgen Klopp in the hunt for the Quadruple. The Red Devils will be out for revenge after their 5-0 humbling at Old Trafford earlier in the season and they have previous when it comes to denting trophy aspirations at Anfield. 1977 saw Liverpool lift the first of their six European Cups and Bob Paisley also guided his side to a league championship. However, defeat in the FA Cup final prevented a then-unprecedented Treble, Jimmy Greenhoff scoring the winner for Manchester United in a 2-1 win for Tommy Docherty’s side.

The Red Devils memorably defeated the Blues on penalties in Moscow to clinch a third European Cup win, but a spot-kick ended their FA Cup chances at the quarter-final stage. Eventual winners Portsmouth secured the shock win after Milan Baros was fouled by Tomasz Kuszczak in the box, which led to the Polish keeper receiving his marching orders. Sulley Muntari then smashed the ball past stand-in keeper Rio Ferdinand to send Pompey to the semis at United’s expense.  Left-wing: David Ginola Manchester United’s thrilling Treble-winning story in 1999 was famous for dramatic turnarounds at home and abroad but a quarter-final tie against Tottenham in the League Cup proved to be the one time the Red Devils couldn’t snatch victory after going behind. Ferguson selected a weakened side and Spurs took full advantage, running out 3-1 winners. French winger David Ginola was at his imperious best, setting up Chris Armstrong for a goal before sealing passage to the semis with a superb long-range strike that killed off any chance of a trademark comeback.  Striker: Kubilay Turkyilmaz After winning the inaugural Premier League title in 1993, the following campaign marked Manchester United’s first foray into Europe’s premier competition for over 20 years. Unfortunately for Ferguson’s men it was a short adventure, the Red Devils going out to Turkish champions Galatasaray in the second round on away goals. Swiss international Kubilay Turkyilmaz bagged a brace in a 3-3 draw at Old Trafford to end any hopes United had of a clean sweep that season. However, a historic Double was completed come May and a domestic Treble was a whisker away after defeat to Aston Villa in the League Cup final.  Striker: Samuel Eto’o Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has put a huge dent in Chelsea’s hopes of retaining the Champions League this year but back in 2010, the Italian was masterminding the Blues to a domestic Double in his first season at Stamford Bridge. Reigning champions Manchester United were pipped in the race for the Premier League, while relegated Portsmouth lost out in the FA Cup final. However, Inter Milan dashed any dreams of a hat-trick of trophies in the Champions League round of 16, with the Nerazzurri guided to their own Treble by former Blues boss Jose Mourinho.  Striker: Fernando Llorente A clean sweep of all the domestic trophies available to Manchester City in 2019 meant that a maiden win in the Champions League would’ve made it the most successful season any English side has ever had. However, a memorable quarter-final clash with Tottenham ended up with the Citizens crashing out on away goals after a bonkers second leg at the Etihad. Fernando Llorente scored the decisive goal after a check for handball was completed and more VAR drama was to ensue following a decision to rule out a late Raheem Sterling strike for offside.

146,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-coventry-bright-future-mark-robins-championship-promotion,Sky Blues with bright future: Coventry can celebrate season,"Their unlikely promotion charge is over but Coventry City have a phenomenal season to look back on and the brightest of futures ahead. For many fanbases, the dashing of play-off dreams this late into the season would land somewhere on a bitter scale from crushing disappointment to ‘[insert manager X] out’ memes littering replies to every social media post put out by the club. In the case of Coventry City supporters, Wednesday night’s defeat to Nottingham Forest likely put paid to any chance of promotion. But it matters not when considering the resounding success of this campaign. Even the most optimistic of Sky Blues’ fans could not have foreseen Mark Robins’ side legitimately challenging for a place in the Premier League so deep into the season. A four-game winless run since hitting Sheffield United for four almost a month ago has left Coventry eight points off the Blades in sixth place with just six games remaining. Coventry’s chances of being in the top six were not fleeting. They were there for the majority of the first half of the season, but have not returned since dropping out towards the end of November. Since then, they have flirted with those positions but remained on the periphery. QPR and Blackburn were the middle of the season’s dark horses and Luton Town are the underdogs finishing in style; Coventry got the ball rolling in giving us hope of an unexpected team making their way to the top flight. Best season we've had at the Ricoh.Some unbelievable games up there throughout the past 10 months.I've got memories of games with my boys and mates that we'll never forget.Mark Robins and the team have done us proud. — Mark (@mabmab71) April 6, 2022  The use of the word ‘team’ there is important, for Coventry as a club should not be a surprise for promotion. Yet their recent history has been anything but straightforward. Only half a decade ago, the Midlands club were in League Two. This time last year, they were still exiled in Birmingham, trapped in a stadium to which they return as visitors over the Easter weekend. It will be a stark reminder – not that it’s needed – of just how far Coventry have come in a short space of time. Promotion has looked an outside bet for a few months, but that is small fry compared to a fanbase having its club back. The progress is steady yet majestic. Two promotions in four years and a solid first season back in the Championship last time out have given great cause for celebration, and this campaign has had many magical moments. There is some sweetness to the fact that Coventry’s season of hope was bookended with fixtures against Nottingham Forest. The last-minute opening-day victory over Chris Hughton’s side showed this was a side with stardust in their boots before defeat to the same opponents this week effectively ended promotion hopes.  But when we all look back on this campaign, it is the spirit of the former which will bring many more memories to mind: the 98th-minute winner against Reading in August; Matty Godden’s November injury-time strike against Bristol City; two goals in the final five minutes to snatch a draw at Bournemouth; a 93rd-minute leveller at Huddersfield; another late winner away at Reading; a 1-0 win with the deadlock broken three minutes into injury-time at home to Barnsley; a late winner at Bristol City; and injury-time equalisers against Preston and Blackburn. It has all added up to an amazing season. That’s not even including the 4-1 home victory over Fulham back in October. In many ways, that never-say-die spirit exemplifies a club who have fought back from the brink to re-establish themselves in their city at a stadium that isn’t quite theirs. There are plans to find somewhere more suitable and beneficial than the Ricoh Arena in the medium to long-term, but the going is very good right now. Coventry have been far from perfect – snatching victories from the jaws of draws and points from the jaws of defeat is not sustainable – but this is a club that looked like not having a long-term future whatsoever at one stage. Next season, it is important that Coventry address some of the issues within the squad to continue their perennial progression over the last five seasons. Strikers Viktor Gyokeres and Godden have both reached double figures for goals, but no other Coventry player has scored more than three times. More defenders have reached that tally than midfielders, going some way to showing that beyond the front two, Coventry do not have attacking players on whom they can consistently rely. Godden has only managed to play 24 times due to a variety of injuries and lack of early form. Having a regular source of goals beyond the strike force is crucial in progressing further, while a deeper squad will be useful in plugging gaps or changing systems when the going gets rough on winless runs such as the current one. But all that matters little when taking into account that this season has been exactly what it should be for football fans: fun and with plenty of memories made along the way. For a fanbase who have suffered so much in the 21st century, the present and future are looking particularly bright for the Sky Blues. ",positive,liverpool,0
147,https://www.football365.com/news/16-conclusions-liverpool-manchester-city-salah-foden-de-bruyne-premier-league,16 Conclusions: Liverpool 2-2 Manchester City,"Manchester City will feel aggrieved at a couple of decisions that went against them, but a draw was probably a fair result against Liverpool at Anfield. 1) Football is at its absolute best when the script gets thrown out of the window. Much as we love our tactics and predictions, and much as we all believe that we know exactly what will happen before a ball is kicked, even the most meticulously planned matches can head to some extraordinary places, once everybody has loosened up. There was no sign whatsoever at half-time that we could be in for one of the best 45 minutes of football that we’ll see all season, but that is exactly what followed.  2) It’s fair to say that Manchester City have been blowing hot and cold. They rattled six goals past RB Leipzig in the Champions League and Wycombe Wanderers in the Carabao Cup, while their 1-0 win at Chelsea was a consummate team performance. But sandwiched between those were a goalless home draw against Southampton and a loss to PSG. Strange though it may seem to say of a team that has already twice scored six and five so far this season, their most pressing recent issues had come in front of goal. With just two in their previous three Premier League matches, attention returned to the subject of why Sergio Aguero was not replaced during the summer. Manchester City’s ‘issues’ are far from terminal, but when expectation levels are sky-high, the margins for error reduce to the breadth of a hair. Liverpool, on the other hand, have had an air of serenity about them for much of this season so far. Apart from their Premier League match against Brentford – which was the sporting equivalent of being sucked into a tornado and deposited somewhere an hour and fifty minutes later – they’d looked fairly solid, winning without breaking into too much of a sweat and holding Chelsea to a draw. Mo Salah had been in electrifying form, the defence had been sound. While the drama has been going on elsewhere already this season, Liverpool had been quietly getting on with the job of positioning themselves well in both the Premier League and the Champions League.  3) City’s lack of a striker glared most obviously midway through the first half, when Bernardo Silva wriggled his way skilfully through the Liverpool midfield and then threaded a perfectly-weighted pass through the left-hand channel for Phil Foden, who drew Alisson out, only for his shot to be blocked by the goalkeeper’s legs.  4) After this slightly sluggish opening, Manchester City started to leave Liverpool behind a little. Three minutes after Foden’s chance came another, when Cancelo fed the ball inside to Kevin de Bruyne, whose shot from a tight angle was a little optimistic and flew wide. But with half an hour played, Liverpool were moving from sluggish to pedestrian. Phil Foden broke through on the left and went to ground following a challenge from James Milner that had a hint of foul about it, but not enough to persuade the referee to put his whistle to his lips. There’s some debate to be had over whether it happened inside or outside the penalty area, most of which was academic because no foul was given. Barely 30 seconds later, Jack Grealish was in plenty of space on the left and managed to cut along the touchline, only to rifle his shot high and away from goal.  5) Liverpool spent most of the last 15 minutes of the first half camped in their own half of the pitch. Smothered in midfield and with space starting to show behind the home side’s defence, the City attackers grew in confidence as the half progressed after an opening which had seen them defending far deeper than they did against Chelsea. As soon as Manchester City had identified the weakness on the Liverpool right, they started to tailor their movement towards getting the ball towards that channel, and as soon as they did that they started to really dominate the game.  6) When Ederson signed for Manchester City for £35m in the summer of 2017, there were one or two who questioned spending that amount of money on a goalkeeper. That question should have been emphatically answered by now regardless, but at the very end of the first half he showed exactly what extra options the best goalkeepers in the world bring to a team with an absolutely sumptuous 70-yard pass to set up a chance from almost nothing for Phil Foden. It was only another good save from his opposite number that managed to keep the score goalless.    7) By the end of the first half, Jurgen Klopp was open-mouthed, having watched his team’s first-half performance. To say that he will have been more relieved than Pep Guardiola to have got to half-time on level terms is one of the understatements of the season, with James Milner, who was alleged to be playing at right-back, looking particularly tortured in his position. Liverpool would have been at least a goal or two behind by half-time had Alisson not been on top of his game for the first 45 minutes. But it wouldn’t been difficult to imagine a certain amount of concern on the part of Pep Guardiola. Manchester City had dominated possession, created all the best chances, and had come away from 45 minutes of football without any tangible reward. Not only was this starting to look like a repeat of the PSG match, but it also served as a reminder of that broader question over City’s attacking options in the post-Aguero age. It was a bit of a surprise that neither manager opted to make any changes at half-time.  8) Liverpool did at least come out for the second half with a little more purpose, and five minutes into the second half Diogo Jota brought a fine save from Ederson. Indeed, Jota seemed particularly animated throughout the first ten minutes after the restart. A couple of minutes after this shot he was running at the Manchester City defence again, this time drawing Cancelo into a tackle which made contact, but didn’t impress referee Paul Tierney enough to give Liverpool a penalty. But none of this energy did Jota a great deal of good. He was withdrawn in place of Roberto Firminho mid-way through the second half.  9) Liverpool’s reward for their refreshed second-half performance took just 13 minutes to arrive. Some tidy interplay on the right left the ball with Salah, who ran at the Manchester City defence before feeding the ball an absolutely inch-perfect through ball for Sadio Mane to score. Mane’s run across the central defender and finish past Ederson was superb, but it would have counted for nothing had it not been for a brilliant pass from Salah, who’d been particularly anonymous prior to this.  10) Anfield had not been silenced by Liverpool’s first-half inertia, and the noise reached a familiar level of crescendo with the goal. With the noise of the crowd swelling behind Liverpool, it was as if the two teams’ roles had been completely reversed during the half-time break. And when Manchester City’s equaliser came, it came from out of nowhere. Gabriel Jesus cut in from the right-hand side, but the Liverpool challenges that he faced weren’t particularly, well, challenging. He played the ball right to Phil Foden, and Foden looked at first to have carried the ball a little too far wide before collecting himself and shooting across Alisson to bring City level. Foden had been the best of Manchester City’s players by a substantial distance, and he thoroughly deserved his goal.  11) After 73 minutes, Bernardo Silva was fouled by James Milner, who was already on a yellow card. It looked pretty much nailed on to be a second yellow; the video assistant doesn’t check for second yellow cards so this never followed. Pep’s reaction to all of this will have looked very familiar to those who remember his reaction to a handball not being given during a fixture between Liverpool and City in 2019 and sure enough, these reactions are never not funny (and all the more so for the fact that the fourth official for this match was one Mike Dean), but it wasn’t difficult to see why he reacted in the way that he did, even though he did pick up a yellow card for his troubles.  12) And if Pep was ready to explode with the failure to send Milner off, he was likely ready to go supernova three minutes later. Mo Salah had endured a difficult first half, but his form throughout the season so far has been superb, and he picked the ball up on the right-hand side of the penalty area, twisted and turned his way through the defence, and slid the ball coolly across the goalkeeper and in to put Liverpool back into the lead. It was a superb piece of invention, a supreme example of a player grabbing the entire game by the scruff of the neck. If the aftershocks of Pep’s reaction to the non-sending off had been loud, they were drowned out by the wall of sound that accompanied the ball hitting the back of the net. From the point of view of Sky Sports’ microphone muters, this was almost certainly a very, very good thing indeed.  13) Anfield’s delirium lasted for precisely five minutes. Phil Foden was picked out by a long, raking pass from central defence, turned it inside and rolled the ball towards Kyle Walker. Between Walker and his marker, the ball flicked loose to Kevin De Bruyne, whose curling shot was deflected past Alisson to bring Manchester City level again. Pep’s reaction to the goal was a perfect 50-50 between furious and delighted, but it was no less than his team deserved, even though Liverpool had broadly dominated the second half to that point.  14) Even after these four goals in 22 minutes, there was still time for another opportunity to decisively swing the match to one of the teams. Liverpool won a free-kick on the right, and Jordan Henderson took it short to Salah. His cross wasn’t the best we’ll see this season, but Ederson seemed to have a bit of a rush of blood to the head and charged out to try and gather it, but only succeeded in letting it sail straight past him. At the far post was Fabinho, who found himself suddenly staring an open goal full in the face, but he wasn’t reckoning on Rodri sliding in to make a literal game-saving tackle to deflect the ball from goal. Both teams were a little sloppy in the closing minutes, but neither seemed to have settled for a draw and the game undulated as they both tried to push forward in search of a winning goal.  15) That a winning goal didn’t come was, just about, fair. Liverpool didn’t really turn up for the first half at all, but the way in which they controlled the game throughout the first 20 minutes of the second half meant this was largely forgotten by the closing stages. Mo Salah summed up their afternoon, largely anonymous in the first half, inspired and transformational in the second, but Jurgen Klopp will be concerned at the sluggishness of their first-half performance, especially coming after a fairly straightforward win in their previous match against Porto. Manchester City may feel aggrieved at the failure to send off Milner, but if luck evens itself out over the course of a season, then sometimes it can even itself out over the course of just a few minutes. The deflection on their second goal was big, and the ball might not have gone in otherwise, and had Liverpool’s late chance fallen to a striker rather than Fabinho, then things might have ended up different again. A genuine question remains over whether they can negotiate their way through the entire season without having bought a replacement for Sergio Aguero during the summer, but when Phil Foden is playing the sort of football that he was in this match, that question at least feels a little less important than it did before.  16) It’s too early to say whether this result will have any significant bearing on the eventual destination of the Premier League trophy, but when the football on display is this good, when the match leaves you on the edge of your seat even though you don’t have any particular interest in one team winning or one team losing, does that really matter? Both Manchester City and Liverpool may emerge from this game feeling a a little disappointed – City were probably just the better team over the whole 90 minutes, but Liverpool did lose a lead twice – but in truth, both teams deserve congratulations for a heart-stopping and tumultuous match.

Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola have taken the Reds and the Citizens to new levels with the two sides separated by a single point over the past four seasons put together. Man City have 338 points from 144 Premier League matches, while Liverpool have 337 points from exactly the same amount of games. Big Weekend: Man City v Liverpool, Lampard, Arsenal, Cornet And only one point splits them this season too with Klopp’s side travelling to the Etihad Stadium to face City on Sunday in a potential Premier League title decider. There have been many great rivalries down the years in the Premier League with Liverpool vs Manchester United always fierce, while the Red Devils against Arsenal was a huge clash when Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger were fighting for titles. But Carragher reckons it is hard to beat the current Liverpool versus City rivalry with the two Premier League clubs “the two best teams in the world”. Carragher wrote in the Daily Telegraph: “Liverpool versus Manchester City has become the greatest, most intense and highest quality rivalry in English football history. “There is a uniqueness to it. This is the first time the two best teams in England are the two best teams in the world, led by the two greatest coaches of their generation. “I can hear the dissent from Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea fans as I argue this. There are plenty of head-to-heads worthy of comparison. “Many will claim that the fixtures overseen by Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger at their peak were of similar quality and packed just as much of an emotional punch. “To me, the parallels run out of steam when applied to European competition.” Carragher added: “Even at the height of their Premier League power – when it was obvious if one club did not end the season champions, the other would – could it be argued that United and Arsenal were the two best teams in Europe? “Ahead of Real Madrid, Juventus and AC Milan? No, United versus Arsenal was generally a domestic squabble.” ",positive,liverpool,6
149,https://www.football365.com/news/guardiola-manchester-city-overthink-threatens-play-12-players-atletico-madrid,‘I overthink’ – Guardiola threatens to play 12 players vs Atletico,"Pep Guardiola has made fun of accusations that he overthinks his tactics in key Champions League matches by joking he will play with 12 players against Atletico Madrid on Tuesday night. Although Guardiola has guided City to three Premier League titles, four League Cups and one FA Cup, he is yet to taste glory in Europe with the Citizens. There has been criticism over the years of Guardiola for overthinking his tactics when his team faces big matches in the Champions League. Spurs > Man City and other 2022 Premier League stats Guardiola was criticised for not starting Rodri or Fernandinho in last season’s final defeat to Chelsea, while fingers were also pointed towards him the previous year as they crashed out to Lyon in the quarter-finals. Speaking at a pre-match press conference before they face Atletico Madrid on Tuesday, the Spaniard said: “In the Champions League always I overthink. New tactics, tomorrow you will see a new one. “I over think a lot, that’s why I have very good results in the CL. Would be boring if I always played the same way. If people think I play the same against Atletico and Liverpool, I don’t like. “The movements are different, the players are all different with different personalities. That’s why I overthink and create stupid tactics. Tonight I take an inspiration and I’m going to do incredible tactics tomorrow. We play with 12 tomorrow!” On Atletico Madrid potentially using the ‘dark arts’ to beat City, Guardiola added: “We have to do the same, defend our position. It’s part of the game. Southampton in the cup when we concede we played terrible. I’m not going to judge what they do, analyse what to do to get a good result to go to Madrid next week. “What is playing ugly? My team won in Old Trafford 1-0 and Bernardo Silva spend five minutes in the corner, that is not ugly. It’s defending the position. I’m here to talk about what we try to do, I never judge the opponents. What they do, what we have to do to win.” On how no away goals rule changes their preparation, Guardiola continued: “We were out three times on away goals. Unfortunately now is changes, influence is less. We are going to play to win, high intensity to create chances and in Madrid the same. We are going to have success or go out. “We adapt to the rules, all the time we’ve tried to win. When you are out because they score away you can’t score. 5-5 you are out because they score three and you score one. Always, ‘oh my god’, a pity. Now it’s not a debate. Try to play the game best as possible.” ",positive,liverpool,1
150,https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-manchester-city-liverpool-guardiola-klopp-friendly-fire,Man City and Liverpool await face-off after friendly fire,"The rivalry between Manchester City and Liverpool – Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp – has a thread of friendly fire running through it. It seems aeons ago since Manchester City and Liverpool last initiated hostilities on the pitch. Their relationship has always been a rather distant one, compiling wins on a never-ending loop until – after trampling over everybody else – they face off to slap each other. Six months ago they produced pulsating drama at Anfield, sharing four goals in a game that had a manic, knockout tie quality to it. The fixture list now demands both come out and put on a Goliath versus Goliath Super Sunday and then do it all again with a Saturday matinee performance. There’s arms-length friendly fire respect between Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola, which isn’t the most enticing trailer for movie time. Very little energy is wasted on the build-up apart from the standard appreciation society. Neither manager expects the other to drop any points. Tick. Klopp always puts the favourites tag around the blues so that his rednecks can feel like the hunters. Tick. Pep tells us for the umpteenth time that Jurgen is the toughest opponent he has ever faced in his career. Tick. It’s all rather respectful if a little forced. The only time they broke into a spontaneous spat was when the German claimed his rivals had enjoyed a two-week break because of Covid. As Guardiola retorted at the time: “I thought Jurgen was not that kind of manager.” Gentle put-downs are as aggressive as it gets. The rest of the Premier League are craning their necks to see if they can get a glimpse of what might be happening up there in this rarefied air. The nerd stat being bandied about is that these two have taken a monumental 337 and 338 points from their last 144 matches. They are streets and interplanetary systems ahead of the rest. This is a proper premium rivalry. It just doesn’t have the historical edge that elicits cosy nostalgia. When Sir Alex Ferguson scoffed at Mark Hughes for suggesting the Manchester derby was the biggest school fight in town, he would have stopped clocks to prevent United not even being in the playground a few years later. Only once has the duopoly disappointed: when the two played out a shadow boxing goalless draw at Anfield in October 2018. That game was full of newly-formed mutual respect, driven by the experience of the helter-skelter style and intensity of Liverpool’s two most famous thrill-seeking wins. Pep, with furrowed brow and all, couldn’t stop worrying about that front three in those 4-3 and 3-0 losses. Something had to be tweaked to neuter the flying fortress of firepower. Klopp graduated from that base style where his team had to fight like “animals” just to get the ball. The last time the Reds went to the lion’s den in vital title race territory back in January 2019 they carried a seven-point lead which may have influenced a more conservative line-up. Sticking a half-fit James Milner into midfield alongside the workaholics Gini Wijnaldum (is he still not missed?) and Jordan Henderson didn’t quite work out. This autumn, Liverpool’s limited midfield was torn asunder again at times with Milner operating as a ragdoll full-back ripped to shreds by Phil Foden. Curtis Jones and Henderson struggled to shut doors as Foden, Rodri and Bernardo Silva flooded the not-so-watertight compartments. In the second half, Liverpool came roaring back with their “killers” as Gary Neville likes to describe them. Guardiola waxed lyrical: “What a game. That is the reason the last years Man City and Liverpool were always there because we try to play in this way.” It’s been 17 months since Liverpool saw the Etihad. Klopp went full metal jacket, throwing all four strikers onto the pitch from the off in a 1-1 draw. It worked for about 20 minutes before City managed to sort themselves out and then gain the ascendancy.  The overriding feeling of the last few years is that this match, especially at home, rests on Pep’s racket. Guardiola constantly talks about playing with personality. Results, although not secondary for one minute, will always be less important to his mantra: being themselves. City excel in finding the comfort of constant mesmeric rhythms which the opposition just can’t disrupt. He joked he was going to be clever against Atletico and play 12 men. Only overthinking and a courageous opponent can disturb the beats and lead to defeat. This Liverpool have now developed enough to change it up without relying on emergency Divock Origi mode. Their sophistication in-game will be curious to witness if things start to unravel on Sunday. They were the team with literally no substitutes in Kyiv four years ago. Now they have some aces to play to seize the day. As Klopp might say, this is “boom” or bust. ",positive,liverpool,8
