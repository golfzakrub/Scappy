0,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60970965,Manchester City 2-2 Liverpool: Top two draw to maintain pulsating title race,"Manchester City retained their slender one-point advantage at the top of the Premier League as they fought out a classic draw with closest rivals Liverpool at Etihad Stadium. The meeting between the country's two outstanding sides lived up to its pre-match billing and in the end there was nothing to separate them, with the destination of the title still hanging in the balance with seven games remaining. City flew out of the blocks to take an early lead through Kevin de Bruyne's deflected strike but Liverpool were quickly on terms when Diogo Jota turned home Trent Alexander-Arnold's pass. Pep Guardiola's side dominated a magnificent first 45 minutes but failed to convert a host of chances before Gabriel Jesus stole in behind Alexander-Arnold to restore their lead from Joao Cancelo's cross nine minutes before the break. Liverpool had been strangely nervous but came out rejuvenated after the re-start, equalising when Sadio Mane celebrated his 30th birthday by scoring from Mohamed Salah's perfect pass in the 47th minute. Raheem Sterling had a goal ruled out for offside as both sides pressed for a winner in this superb match, with City substitute Riyad Mahrez wasting a chance to win it in the dying seconds as he lifted his finish over the top. Manchester City and manager Pep Guardiola may regret their failure to turn first-half superiority into a more meaningful advantage but they will not be wholly dissatisfied with the outcome. There will certainly be no dissatisfaction with City's level of performance, which was outstanding apart from a sloppy first 15 minutes at the start of the second half, during which Liverpool equalised and the reigning Premier League champions were on the back foot. City's supporters seemed happy enough with the final outcome, clearly living on their nerves in the closing stages knowing Liverpool's threat and their capacity to strike at any time. De Bruyne was at his imperious best, although Sterling struggled against his former club, his day summed up when arguably his most composed piece of play in a frenetic afternoon saw a low finish past Alisson ruled out for offside, while Liverpool's keeper also denied him in the opening moments of the game. City's advantage at the top of the table is just that one point but knowing how formidable Liverpool's challenge can be, you suspect Guardiola will settle for it with only seven games left and a fixture list that looks manageable. He would have preferred the victory that would have opened up a crucial gap but City have survived their toughest fixture of the season against their most dangerous opponents largely unscathed. This was never going to be the so-called title decider, no matter what the outcome. There is still the capacity for too many potential twists and turns to call it so soon. Liverpool came into the game in outstanding form, on the back of 10 straight league wins and a club record eight successive away wins in all competitions. And yet, they started with uncharacteristic unease and hesitancy, especially at the back where there were several nervous moments. Even when they are off their best, Liverpool still possess ever-present menace and the poacher supreme Jota settled Jurgen Klopp's side with a trademark finish for his 15th Premier League goal of the season. Liverpool were fortunate to be only 2-1 down at half-time, although City keeper Ederson sent palpitations around Etihad Stadium when he lost control of the ball on his goal-line with Jota in close attendance, recovering to show nerves of steel and regain his poise. Klopp clearly delivered some stern messages to his players at the break and Liverpool were much more themselves in the second half, Mane striking almost immediately and their pressing game finally rushing City into mistakes. Liverpool may still be in second place but they are right in this title hunt. Like Guardiola, Klopp would have preferred all three points but he will not be unhappy with one from this wonderful Premier League spectacle.

1,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60970969,Norwich City 2-0 Burnley: Pierre Lees-Melou and Teemu Pukki keep Canaries' hope alive,"Bottom club Norwich City kept alive their slim hopes of avoiding a quick-fire return to the Championship and dealt a blow to fellow strugglers Burnley with a crucial win at Carrow Road. Pierre Lees-Melou's first goal since signing from Nice last July and Teemu Pukki's 86th-minute finish settled a tense relegation scrap - and earned the Canaries only their fifth Premier League victory since winning promotion last season. French midfielder Lees-Melou's ninth-minute deflected shot, which went in off the post, put the hosts on their way before Pukki drilled home the second to give Norwich a glimmer of hope of staying up, with Dean Smith's side now seven points from safety with seven matches left. Burnley had their moments, with Maxwel Cornet, the match-winning hero against Everton in midweek, missing a glorious chance from three yards out. In what was a must-win game, Norwich's defence came under relentless pressure at times but recorded back-to-back clean sheets in the league for the first time since October. ""We know it's hard and still a mountain but we have seven games to go now, so if you put a few wins together the table looks different,"" said Norwich boss Smith. The result leaves the Clarets 18th in the table, four points from safety with eight matches remaining. ""It's still the same challenge but a game down,"" Burnley manager Sean Dyche said. With struggling Everton beating Manchester United on Saturday, Norwich started Sunday's game 10 points from safety with eight matches left. But Smith's side passed the pressure test in style with a first win in nine league games. It will still require a monumental effort for them to survive. Three of their final seven matches include teams challenging for Europe - West Ham (home), Tottenham (home) and Manchester United (away). ""We want to take it to the last game, but we know how hard it could be,"" added Smith. ""Hopefully we can find that resilience in the results."" Even before Lees-Melou's goal, Milot Rashica forced Nick Pope into a diving save, while the Burnley keeper denied Pukki with his legs. Just as impressive for Smith was his side's performance at the back. Norwich made several vital blocks to frustrate Burnley, including one by former Clarets defender Ben Gibson to keep out Ashley Westwood's volley. In the closing stages, Norwich's Grant Hanley headed against the bar while Pope denied Rashica before Pukki had home fans celebrating a rare win. Cornet will have nightmares about his 65th-minute miss, just days after he left the pitch at Turf Moor with fans singing his name following his late winner against Everton. He looked certain to equalise as he slid to meet Dwight McNeil's lovely pass, but somehow put it wide as Burnley failed to score for the 15th time in the league this season. ""We can't miss chances like that,"" Dyche said. ""He's done well for us this season. But we have to take the game on and be better than that in the front third."" Earlier, Cornet was denied by Tim Krul, but the Norwich keeper was not tested nearly enough in what was a high-stakes game. Dyche will still believe his side can climb out of trouble in the closing weeks, and they still have to meet fellow strugglers Watford on 30 April. But despite beating Everton on Wednesday, Burnley's task has become more difficult after this defeat at Carrow Road. ""It was a huge setback after a huge step forward,"" added Dyche. ""It might come easier in a strange way when people write you off. Virtually everyone will think we're done, but we don't think that.""

2,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60970968,Brentford 2-0 West Ham United: Hosts deliver huge blow to Hammers' top-four hopes,"Brentford delivered a huge blow to West Ham's top-four hopes as the Bees moved further clear of the relegation places with victory in west London. Second-half goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney saw Thomas Frank's side climb to 13th in the table, 12 points clear of the bottom three, to all but confirm their Premier League safety. Mbeumo fired in from Toney's pass shortly after half-time, before turning provider for his team-mate as Toney headed in after 64 minutes. ""I'm very proud. It was a top performance against a very good side who are in the quarter-final of the Europa League and fighting for a Champions League spot,"" said manager Frank. ""It was close to a complete performance. The way we did it shows how far we've come. It's a combination of a top performance and a good win."" He added: ""Of course I looked at the table, but I want to focus on the next game."" The hosts had appeared the more likely to break the deadlock before half-time, but the heavily involved Mbeumo headed at Lukasz Fabianski and also saw a powerful strike pushed away by the West Ham goalkeeper. The visitors managed only one shot on target - a first-half Tomas Soucek header - in a subdued display, while Kurt Zouma was forced off early with an ankle problem ahead of Thursday's Europa League quarter-final second leg in Lyon. The Hammers remain sixth, six points adrift of fourth-placed Tottenham in the race for Champions League football, having also played a game more than Spurs. There was no shortage of motivation for West Ham, after defeats for fellow top-four hopefuls Arsenal and Manchester United on Saturday left the fight for the European positions wide open. But, with the game falling between two huge meetings with Lyon, the Hammers struggled against a Brentford side full of confidence following their memorable 4-1 win over Chelsea last week. Instead, it was the hosts who maintained their fine form at the end of their first Premier League season, deservedly securing a fourth win in five league games. That upturn in results has coincided with the signing of Christian Eriksen, who once again produced a superb midfield display to offer the base for Brentford's superior attacking output. The hosts had been by far the more fluent in the final third in the opening 45 minutes, recording nine shots to the Hammers' two, but Mbeumo in particular was unable to capitalise with any of his five attempts. They made their chances count in the second half, though, as the 22-year-old Mbeumo seized his first opportunity after the restart, before his looping cross allowed Toney to put the game beyond West Ham. David Moyes called on Said Benrahma and Nikola Vlasic from the bench in the hope of inspiring a fightback, with Benrahma seeing a deflected effort drop on to the roof of the net. Brentford had further chances to extend their advantage too, Mbeumo notably shooting over at close range, but their misses did not prove costly as another excellent result was secured. It is now all eyes on Lyon for West Ham, who must rest up and regroup quickly as they attempt to reach the club's first European semi-final since 1976. ""I don't have any complaints at all, we weren't really at it from the start,"" said West Ham boss Moyes. ""There are mitigating circumstances. We had a tough game on Thursday and the Thursday-Sunday schedule is not ideal. For the most part this season we've been very good but today felt like one too many.""

3,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60970974,Leicester City 2-1 Crystal Palace: Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall stars in hard-earned win,"Leicester continued their fine run of recent form as homegrown talent Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall played a starring role in a hard-earned win over Crystal Palace. The Foxes started slowly at the King Power Stadium but Dewsbury-Hall carved Palace open with a superb ball for Ademola Lookman to fire home, before whipping his own finish high into the net six minutes later. The 23-year-old's moments of quality proved telling in a fixture both sides could have been forgiven for looking past given their mid-table status and with key cup fixtures in the coming week. Palace - who missed early chances through Wilfried Zaha, Jean-Philippe Mateta and Joachim Andersen - refused to give in after the break and Youri Tielemans' foul on Jordan Ayew in the penalty area offered them a route back into the match. Zaha saw his penalty saved and when VAR pointed to encroachment in the area by home defender Caglar Soyuncu, his retaken penalty was also palmed away by Kasper Schmeichel, only for the Ivory Coast international to head in the rebound. It prompted a spirited 10 minutes from Palace - who went close through a Jeffrey Schlupp flick - but their seven-game unbeaten run ends. Leicester now have four wins and a draw from their past six league games - form that lifts them to ninth in the table, one place above the beaten visitors. A closely matched game - possession was 50-50, while Leicester managed just one more shot than their visitors - was arguably to be expected given two sides enjoying very similar fortunes. Leicester did not pick up a league win for all of January and February but have found late-season form. Palace won just once over the same period and have themselves found momentum deep in the campaign. Throw in the fact that Leicester face a key Europa Conference League second leg against PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday while Palace have one eye on next Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea and it would be easy to see why either side might have opted to preserve energy. And Leicester's seven changes from their 0-0 first-leg draw with PSV appeared to cause a lack of cohesion that Palace might have exploited. But the visitors were unable to take half-chances and Dewsbury-Hall made them pay by reversing a defence-splitting pass into Lookman's path for the opener before patiently creating shooting space of his own for a rifled second. The 23-year-old was certainly not coasting. He ran further than anyone else on the pitch - clocking 11.3km - and hit a higher top speed than anyone in his sprints. ""It means so much,"" he said of his goal. ""It's a dream come true to score in the Premier League. I have dreamt it since I was a little boy. I have come close but I am so happy today."" Palace, who have not ended a top-flight campaign higher than 10th since finishing third 1990-91, will rue a period late in the first half when they slackened off and let the Foxes in. Dewsbury-Hall's assist saw them opened too easily, while his goal owed much to a missed clearance by Marc Guehi in the build-up. When they did rally, Zaha was integral to the improvement and his form will offer confidence for next week's semi-final. After scoring, he fought admirably to conjure an equaliser, notably when teeing up Schlupp who saw his flick blocked by a sea of Leicester bodies.

4,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60970958,Fulham 1-3 Coventry City - Sky Blues stun league leaders at Craven Cottage,"Coventry City shocked Championship leaders Fulham 3-1 at Craven Cottage to delay the home side's seemingly inevitable promotion to the Premier League. Michael Rose and Viktor Gyokeres scored four minutes apart a quarter of the way through the game to give the away team a commanding lead. Substitute Bobby Decordova-Reid's neat, left-foot finish set up a grandstand end to the game after the hosts had squandered a number of chances, with Rodrigo Muniz's deflected effort almost finding its way in to equalise. Callum O'Hare tapped into an empty net following a howler from Fulham captain Tim Ream in added time to secure the points that moved Coventry up to 10th in the table, six points off a play-off place, while Fulham still need two wins to guarantee automatic promotion. Coventry took the lead from a corner as Rose leaped highest to divert the ball past Marek Rodak in the Fulham net. The Slovakian was picking the ball out of his net again four minutes later, and this time he was at fault as he let Gyokeres's long-range shot go through him for 2-0. Fulham carved out their best chance of the first half when Neeskens Kebano met Neco Williams' cross on the volley, crashing his shot against the crossbar. Coventry almost had the game won just before the interval but Fulham somehow managed to keep the ball out from a corner, blocking three shots before finally getting the ball away. Marco Silva sent on Decordova-Reid at half-time in place of Nathaniel Chalobah to inject more pace into the attack and it almost had an instant impact, with Decordova-Reid's ball in turned narrowly wide by Aleksandar Mitrovic. Harry Wilson fizzed a free-kick just over from a threatening position before chances for Williams and Mitrovic as the hosts cranked up the pressure. Decordova-Reid pulled one back with eight minutes to play before Mitrovic sent two headers over. And deep into added time Fulham's hard work was undone when O'Hare turned the ball home following Ream's mistake to kill any hopes of a late point for the hosts. Fulham boss Marco Silva said: ""This afternoon they were more confident and better than us. ""I have to give praise to them, I know at this level it's tough [to win games]. ""It wasn't our afternoon in terms of being clinical because we had six or seven chances to score, we lost this game because of mistakes."" Coventry boss Mark Robins said: ""It's the first time we've won away from home against one of the top 10 teams. ""We created a number of chances on the counter-attack and the position of our defenders against a top scorer (Mitrovic) who's the record holder in the Championship now was very good. The way we played was superb really."" On play-off hopes: ""Until it's mathematically impossible, of course we have [to believe we can do it].

5,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61053312,Ralf Rangnick questions whether Man Utd deserve Europe after Everton defeat,"Ralf Rangnick said Manchester United ""do not deserve"" to play in the Champions League next season if they perform how they did against Everton for the rest of the season. United lost 1-0 at Goodison Park despite Everton going into the game just a point above the relegation zone. It has harmed United's chances of finishing in the top four and securing Champions League qualification. ""If we play like we did here we just don't deserve it,"" said Rangnick. ""The players themselves should be eager to play international football, if possible Champions League.  In order to qualify for Europe you have to be able to score in 95 minutes in a game like this."" Everton came into the match following a disappointing 3-2 defeat by relegation rivals Burnley, who sit just one place below them in the table. Rangnick bemoaned his side's lack of ability to score against Everton, who he believed were low on confidence following that loss to Burnley. ""With all respect to Everton - because they have a good team - but if you don't score against a team who conceded three goals against Burnley, you cannot expect to get anything out of it,"" he added. ""The first 25 minutes we were in full control of the game. We didn't even in those 25 minutes take enough advantage out of that dominating period. ""You could literally feel that Everton were crumbling after that result against Burnley. They were quite logically not full of confidence but we didn't take advantage of that."" Earlier this week, United edged closer to appointing Ajax boss Erik ten Hag as their new manager at the end of the season. They have taken several months over the recruitment process, but interim boss Rangnick said the uncertainty over the managerial situation was no excuse for their underwhelming performances. United have won just eight of the 17 Premier League games Rangnick has overseen - the lowest win percentage (47%) of any manager for the club in the competition. ""I don't think this should be an excuse,"" Rangnick told BT Sport. ""We are Manchester United. We have lots of international players. There shouldn't be an alibi. ""There will be a new manager next season. If this is announced now or in 10 days it shouldn't have an impact."" Goalkeeper David de Gea said Manchester United, who currently sit in seventh place, are ""not good enough"" following the defeat. United have won just once in their past five Premier League games to slip adrift of the top four in seventh. ""We're not good enough, for sure. It's going to be very difficult now to be in the top four,"" said De Gea. ""We don't score, we don't even create proper chances to score."" The Spain keeper also criticised United's lack of hunger to fight for the points, contrasting it with the Toffees' tenacious display. ""We knew before today Everton were struggling and how difficult it was going to be - they were tired, they were nervous, but they keep going and keep fighting,"" the 31-year-old told BT Sport. ""They had more desire than us, which is not acceptable. It's very sad to lose today."" ",positive,liverpool,0
6,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60963800,Arsenal 1-2 Brighton: Gunners boss Mikel Arteta 'concerned' by performance in home defeat,"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said he was ""concerned"" by his side's performance as they handed the initiative in the race for Champions League qualification to rivals Tottenham with a deserved defeat by Brighton at Emirates Stadium. Brighton - seven games without a victory before kick-off - frustrated the home side with their organisation and efficient forward play in a game where Arsenal failed to look threatening until they mustered a desperate late push. Leandro Trossard's curling first-half finish - after a fine assist by the impressive Enock Mwepu - gave Graham Potter's side something to build on. And after Gabriel Martinelli appeared to have headed Arsenal level moments before the break - only for a four-minute VAR check to rule him offside - Brighton remained solid before doubling their lead with a superb Mwepu finish. The Zambia midfielder side-footed home with power from the edge of the box to cap a rounded individual display and produce a look of disbelief on the face of Arteta. ""We made it really difficult for ourselves,"" Arteta told BBC Sport. ""We were sloppy, we had no purpose to attack, we were really imprecise and we didn't want to play forward. ""There are many games to play but we have to be concerned about that performance, especially first half."" Arteta's side rallied late on with Martin Odegaard firing home from range via a deflection but they stay fifth - three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham, who won 4-0 at Aston Villa later on Saturday - while Potter's Brighton move up to 11th after just a fourth win in 26 league games. Were it not for their fine start to the season, Brighton might well have been worrying about escaping the bottom three, such has been their recent run of results. Potter's side had scored just one goal in their previous seven league games and failed to find the net with 31 attempts in last week's 0-0 draw with Norwich. This win, though, saw them take their opportunities and Potter later praised the way they were able to ""hang on and suffer"". Arsenal were simply lacklustre and showed little in the way of a response to what Arteta described as an ""unacceptable"" display in Monday's 3-0 loss at Crystal Palace. It took 25 minutes for an attempt of note when Gabriel headed wide and, other than Martinelli's ruled-out finish from a yard out, they were largely limited to minor glimpses of goal until the closing stages. Lewis Dunk blocked brilliantly to deny Emile Smith Rowe at 1-0 and substitute Nicolas Pepe at 2-0, Yves Bissouma diligently broke up attacks and Marc Cucurella mixed his role in a back three with well-timed forays forward. Mwepu - who only returned from three months out with injury last week - showed exactly what Brighton have been missing. He produced an assist and a goal, won nine duels - a game high - and intercepted the ball more than anyone on the pitch. Potter called on Mwepu and Bissouma to drop into his defensive line for parts of the second half in a fluid tactical display and they shouldered the responsibility admirably. The game saw seven bookings - as many as there were shots on target - and Arteta may point to a stop-start match as a reason for his side's struggle to find momentum. When they did in the closing 10 minutes, Albert Sambi Lokonga whistled a shot wide, Odegaard and substitute Eddie Nketiah both hit the bar during the same attack and seconds later the deficit was halved. Odegaard's long-range effort deflected beyond the diving Sanchez, prompting a final few minutes in which Arsenal pressed keenly for a point they did not deserve. They saw 65% of the ball and had 20 shots - 16 off target - but Brighton's poise for long spells merited this win. Arsenal will need to put two abject displays behind them quickly if they are to claim that crucial fourth-place at the end of their eight-game run-in.

7,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60970965,Manchester City 2-2 Liverpool: Top two draw to maintain pulsating title race,"Manchester City retained their slender one-point advantage at the top of the Premier League as they fought out a classic draw with closest rivals Liverpool at Etihad Stadium. The meeting between the country's two outstanding sides lived up to its pre-match billing and in the end there was nothing to separate them, with the destination of the title still hanging in the balance with seven games remaining. City flew out of the blocks to take an early lead through Kevin de Bruyne's deflected strike but Liverpool were quickly on terms when Diogo Jota turned home Trent Alexander-Arnold's pass. Pep Guardiola's side dominated a magnificent first 45 minutes but failed to convert a host of chances before Gabriel Jesus stole in behind Alexander-Arnold to restore their lead from Joao Cancelo's cross nine minutes before the break. Liverpool had been strangely nervous but came out rejuvenated after the re-start, equalising when Sadio Mane celebrated his 30th birthday by scoring from Mohamed Salah's perfect pass in the 47th minute. Raheem Sterling had a goal ruled out for offside as both sides pressed for a winner in this superb match, with City substitute Riyad Mahrez wasting a chance to win it in the dying seconds as he lifted his finish over the top. Manchester City and manager Pep Guardiola may regret their failure to turn first-half superiority into a more meaningful advantage but they will not be wholly dissatisfied with the outcome. There will certainly be no dissatisfaction with City's level of performance, which was outstanding apart from a sloppy first 15 minutes at the start of the second half, during which Liverpool equalised and the reigning Premier League champions were on the back foot. City's supporters seemed happy enough with the final outcome, clearly living on their nerves in the closing stages knowing Liverpool's threat and their capacity to strike at any time. De Bruyne was at his imperious best, although Sterling struggled against his former club, his day summed up when arguably his most composed piece of play in a frenetic afternoon saw a low finish past Alisson ruled out for offside, while Liverpool's keeper also denied him in the opening moments of the game. City's advantage at the top of the table is just that one point but knowing how formidable Liverpool's challenge can be, you suspect Guardiola will settle for it with only seven games left and a fixture list that looks manageable. He would have preferred the victory that would have opened up a crucial gap but City have survived their toughest fixture of the season against their most dangerous opponents largely unscathed. This was never going to be the so-called title decider, no matter what the outcome. There is still the capacity for too many potential twists and turns to call it so soon. Liverpool came into the game in outstanding form, on the back of 10 straight league wins and a club record eight successive away wins in all competitions. And yet, they started with uncharacteristic unease and hesitancy, especially at the back where there were several nervous moments. Even when they are off their best, Liverpool still possess ever-present menace and the poacher supreme Jota settled Jurgen Klopp's side with a trademark finish for his 15th Premier League goal of the season. Liverpool were fortunate to be only 2-1 down at half-time, although City keeper Ederson sent palpitations around Etihad Stadium when he lost control of the ball on his goal-line with Jota in close attendance, recovering to show nerves of steel and regain his poise. Klopp clearly delivered some stern messages to his players at the break and Liverpool were much more themselves in the second half, Mane striking almost immediately and their pressing game finally rushing City into mistakes. Liverpool may still be in second place but they are right in this title hunt. Like Guardiola, Klopp would have preferred all three points but he will not be unhappy with one from this wonderful Premier League spectacle.

8,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60988011,Manchester City 1-0 Atletico Madrid: Kevin de Bruyne goal gives hosts a slender lead,"Kevin de Bruyne's second-half goal gave Manchester City victory as they overcame Atletico Madrid's typically fierce resistance in their Champions League quarter-final first leg at Etihad Stadium. Diego Simeone's side performed with their trademark defensive discipline, restricting City to very few opportunities until De Bruyne pounced to make the breakthrough with 20 minutes left. Phil Foden, on as a substitute, produced the moment of magic to unlock Atletico with a perfect pass through the legs of Reinildo for De Bruyne to slot past goalkeeper Jan Oblak. It was the decisive moment in the tightest of games but City manager Pep Guardiola's wild celebration illustrated just how much it means to take a lead, even if slender, to Madrid for the second leg on 13 April. It was clear from the opening moments this was going to be a night for patience from City as Atletico, to no-one's great surprise, strung a bank of five defenders across the pitch and invited Guardiola's side to break them down. For the first 45 minutes it worked to perfection as the hosts barely laid a glove on the Spanish champions, who protected keeper Oblak with the diligence and desire Simeone demands. It was actually Atletico who threatened with a couple of breaks early in the second half, but City eventually managed to impose themselves and become more of a threat. De Bruyne saw a free-kick well saved by Oblak and Aymeric Laporte headed over from a good position following a corner. But it was the introduction of Foden that finally allowed City to spread some stardust on proceedings. He showed glorious control and vision to nutmeg Reinildo, allowing De Bruyne to fire low past Oblak to ignite what had been a tense, largely subdued atmosphere inside Etihad Stadium. City could not add a second with De Bruyne denied by a block on the line from Stefan Savic, but any lead is precious against an Atletico side who have made a speciality of frustrating Premier League giants in the past. Liverpool found that out in 2020 when they lost both legs as holders in the last 16, while Manchester United were also eliminated at the same stage this season. ""We played an incredible top side who are difficult to face, but it is a good result,"" said Guardiola. ""We had chances to score a second and third. It is not easy to face a team with a lot of experience in this tournament. We will go there to score and try to win again."" Simeone marched off in defiant fashion at the final whistle and the Argentine will rightly feel Atletico are still in this tie - it would be folly to dismiss Simeone or his durable Champions League campaigners. The onus though, is now on them to attack in the return leg. ""It is a bad result because we lost 1-0 and we were looking to win,"" Simeone said. ""It is clear we were playing against an extraordinary opponent. The numbers and statistics speak for themselves and they play in a very dynamic way. We had to suffer but we have to go to Madrid now and use the tools we have at our disposal. ""We need to be better but we are still in the tie. Let's see if we can have the ball more in the second leg and create more difficulties for our opponents but that comes with being calm and having the collective defensive effort."" However, alterations to Atletico's approach may well suit City more than having to break down the red and white wall of resistance that made their lives so difficult until that important De Bruyne strike on his 50th Champions League appearance for the club.

9,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60986738,Benfica 1-3 Liverpool: Reds in control of Champions League quarter-final,"Liverpool will take a two-goal lead into the Champions League quarter-final second leg at Anfield but Jurgen Klopp says his side are ""not in dreamland"" after an important victory over Benfica in Lisbon. Luis Diaz scored late on to put Klopp's side in control of the encounter but they could have been out of sight were it not for a number of fine saves from Benfica goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos. Ibrahima Konate rose highest to head the visitors into the lead from a corner before Sadio Mane added a clinical second to dampen the mood at a lively Estadio da Luz in a dominant first half. The home fans ramped up the noise again shortly after the interval when Konate's mistake allowed sought-after striker Darwin Nunez to pull one back for the Portuguese outfit and make it a contest. But the Premier League side will have a healthy advantage when they welcome Benfica in the second leg next Wednesday after Diaz added a late third with a composed finish after rounding Vlachodimos, who also denied Diogo Jota in the final moments. ""Coming here and winning an away game in the Champions League is tough. Obviously, Benfica fought for their lives,"" said Klopp. ""We could have scored in the last minute - the fourth one would be nice but we're not in dreamland here. ""It's half-time, we know much more about our opponent, they will go for it again. They won at Ajax, they ground out all the results out in the group stage that they needed, so we are aware of the quality and now we have a nice game in between and then we will be ready again for Benfica."" This was a near perfect start to a mammoth run of games for Liverpool that will define their season, with the return leg sandwiched between Sunday's game at Premier League leaders Manchester City and an FA Cup semi-final against Pep Guardiola's side six days later. The Reds are chasing a historic quadruple and have already won the Carabao Cup this year, despite Klopp saying four trophies is not a realistic target and insisting winning just one other competition this term would be ""outstanding"". Their progress in Europe now looks set but it was not comfortable for the visitors until Diaz skipped round goalkeeper Vlachodimos to score his side's third with three minutes to go. Diaz, jeered throughout because of his history with Benfica's domestic rivals Porto, was making his first Liverpool start in the competition but continued his seamless beginning to life with Klopp's side and proved a threat throughout. He had earlier been denied by Vlachodimos, who stopped Mohamed Salah adding a third before the break as well as keeping out Jota late in the second half. Liverpool were completely in control early on and were already threatening before Konate was left unmarked to head in Andrew Robertson's corner to score his first goal for the club. The visitors then ruthlessly punished a poor touch from former Tottenham and QPR midfielder Adel Taarabt, as Trent Alexander-Arnold angled a superb ball into Diaz and the forward cushioned a header into Mane's path to give him a simple finish. Benfica, who upset an in-form Ajax side in the previous round, responded four minutes into the second half when Konate missed his kick from Rafa Silva's low cross and 22-year-old Uruguay forward Nunez showed why he is so in demand with a composed finish from close range for his fifth goal in the competition this season. That gave the home side belief and, buoyed by the intense atmosphere their fans created, Benfica suddenly looked a different team as Everton tested Alisson from range and Nunez failed to convert after breaking in behind the defence, instead going down under pressure from Virgil van Dijk only to see his penalty appeal waved away. But it was Diaz who stole the show late on and Klopp's attention will now switch to a huge game against City in the race for the Premier League title.

10,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963791,Everton 1-0 Manchester United: Anthony Gordon strike boosts Toffees' survival hopes,"Everton secured what could prove a priceless victory in their battle to avoid relegation as lacklustre Manchester United were beaten at Goodison Park. Frank Lampard's side were plunged into even deeper crisis when they lost at fellow strugglers Burnley in midweek to leave them facing the prospect of dropping into the bottom three this weekend if results went against them. In a game low on quality but high in tension, Everton's victory came courtesy of Anthony Gordon's 27th-minute drive, which took a heavy deflection off United captain Harry Maguire to leave keeper David de Gea wrong-footed. Everton keeper Jordan Pickford made two important early saves from Marcus Rashford and a vital late block from Cristiano Ronaldo, but there was rarely any sense of siege as United lacked urgency, failing to break through in another blow to their hopes of making the Premier League's top four. This could be a huge result in Everton's season, stopping the rot and lifting some of those dark clouds that were starting to gather over Goodison. Everton's win was as far from a classic as it is possible to be but in the wider context it could mean more than so many others this season. Frank Lampard's side remain in trouble but the psychological lift provided by this victory, which removes the prospect of dropping into the bottom three for now at least, saw an explosion of joy around this famous old stadium when referee Jon Moss blew the final whistle. Everton dug deep for victory and had several figures who personified exactly what they will need if they are to maintain their Premier League status. It was fitting that Gordon was the match-winner, the local hero loved by Everton fans for his tireless energy and invention. The supporters warm to him because of his attitude and his deflected strike was a fitting reward. Richarlison is another who has been exempt from criticism, apart from the fact he might have scored more goals. The Brazil striker's work-rate is exceptional, chasing down every lost cause and he brought Goodison Park to its feet in the second half when he juggled the ball on his head by the touchline before winning a corner. He reacted by pumping his fists at the Gwladys Street End to raise the temperature inside an already frantic stadium. And, once more, goalkeeper Pickford made a vital contribution, denying Rashford twice early on as well as Paul Pogba and Ronaldo after the break. The deafening noise at the final whistle told the story, as Lampard joined in celebrations with the fans at the conclusion of a win that cannot be over-valued. Manchester United were still chasing a place in the top four and a slot in next season's Champions League at kick-off. They played as if no-one had told them. United's display was embarrassingly mediocre, a gift for an Everton side looking anywhere for assistance to ease their own troubles. It seems certain Ajax coach Erik ten Hag will be United's next manager, and if he was watching this he will have a notebook full of uncomplimentary references and names crossed out of his plans. Everton were nervous and tense but were ultimately placed under no serious pressure by a United side strolling around without the slightest sense of urgency, without any sense they still had something to fight for this season. The passing was sloppy, so many physical challenges were lost. It was a flat performance that suggests these players have given up on getting any inspiration from interim manager Ralf Rangnick - and he could be forgiven for giving up on them, so abject was this performance. It was only in the final minutes that Everton showed any serious signs of panic in defence, and the biggest condemnation of United is that Lampard's struggling side were themselves average but still deserved the win because they were prepared to fight to earn it. Ronaldo's late yellow card for kicking the ball away could also be marked down as a rare act of aggression rather than the petulance it was, such was the timid, desperate nature of their performance. If, as is expected, Ten Hag is the next United manager, what a task he is taking on.

11,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963798,Southampton 0-6 Chelsea: Saints blown away by devastating Blues display,"Chelsea put a terrible week behind them to return to winning ways in devastating style with a six-goal demolition of Southampton. Having been beaten 4-1 at home to Brentford in the Premier League and then suffering a 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid, Chelsea bounced back in a manner that will give Thomas Tuchel encouragement his side can salvage their Champions League tie in Spain next week. Tuchel said before kick-off that ""things are upside down"" after two damaging results but his players responded by hitting the woodwork three times and scoring four in an astonishing first half at St Mary's Stadium. Timo Werner hit the post and then headed against the bar inside the opening seven minutes before Marcos Alonso fired the visitors ahead after Mason Mount's assist. England midfielder Mount's clean finish from outside the box doubled the lead and then Werner was thwarted by Fraser Forster's fine save as Southampton unravelled in front of their own fans. Werner was soon celebrating his first Premier League goal for six months after bursting through and finishing before Kai Havertz made it 4-0 with a tap-in after Germany team-mate Werner hit the woodwork for a third time. Southampton were blown away and it required a remarkable one-handed stop by Forster to prevent an own goal by Mohammed Salisu before half-time. However, the Saints did concede a fifth in the 49th minute, Werner tapping home his second after N'Golo Kante had been thwarted. Mount made it six from close range on an embarrassing afternoon for Ralph Hasenhuttl and his Southampton players. This was Chelsea back to their clinical best as they took the Saints apart in destructive fashion. Yet Tuchel will be just as pleased with the clean sheet after Chelsea conceded seven times in the previous two games to leave confidence on the floor. Despite the absence of £97.5m forward Romelu Lukaku because of injury and captain Cesar Azpilicueta after a positive coronavirus test, they got back on track before another big week that will help shape their season. They face a huge challenge to turn around their Champions League quarter-final with Real in the Bernabeu on Tuesday before heading to Wembley to face Crystal Palace in next Sunday's FA Cup semi-final - their most realistic hope of a major domestic trophy as it stands. Werner could yet play a big part in how Chelsea's season finishes. Without a Premier League goal since scoring against Southampton last October, he was back to his very best against Saints and should have finished with a hat-trick. The first of his two goals was magnificent with the former RB Leipzig player having too much pace for the chasing Jan Bednarek before going round Forster and finishing. This was a sorry performance by Saints on an afternoon which revived painful memories of those two 9-0 defeats against Manchester United in February 2021 and Leicester in October 2019 under Hasenhuttl. From the opening minute it was far too easy for Chelsea and but for Forster, who produced a string of fine stops as Chelsea peppered his goal with 14 attempts on target, they would have suffered an even more embarrassing defeat. The Saints fans who stayed to the bitter end made their feelings known after this utter capitulation signalled a fourth straight home defeat in all competitions. Fortunately Southampton appear safe in the table. They are 12 points clear of the relegation zone after enjoying several highs this season, including twice coming from behind to win at Tottenham and holding leaders Manchester City home and away. But this was definitely a day to forget as they surrendered without a fight.

12,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/55806211,Manchester United 9-0 Southampton: Man Utd thrash nine-man Saints,"Manchester United equalled the Premier League record by putting nine goals past nine-man Southampton - the second time Saints have lost 9-0 in as many seasons. A red card for Saints' Alexandre Jankewitz after only two minutes triggered a complete collapse for the visitors, who were on the end of the same scoreline against Leicester City in October 2019. It is only the third time a team has lost 9-0 in the Premier League, with United also beating Ipswich Town by that margin in 1995. Aaron Wan-Bissaka opened the scoring with his first goal at Old Trafford. Marcus Rashford and Edinson Cavani also found the net either side of a Jan Bednarek own goal before the break. After a fairly drab start to the second half, United cut loose, scoring five times in the final 21 minutes. Anthony Martial ended an eight-match goal drought before Scott McTominay drove home from the edge of the area. Then, after Bednarek became the second Saints player to be sent off - bringing down Martial to allow Bruno Fernandes the chance to score from the penalty spot on 87 minutes - the French forward netted his second, before Dan James wrapped up the scoring in stoppage time. It was a stunning ending as United almost matched their club record 10-0 victory over Anderlecht in 1956. By the final whistle, it had been forgotten that United had come into Tuesday's game on the back of indifferent form - just one win in their last four matches. The massive impact on their goal difference means it is now bettered only by league leaders Manchester City. Martial should be particularly pleased with his contribution, even though it did not match manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's four-goal salvo as a United substitute in an 8-1 win at Nottingham Forest in 1999. At one point, it looked as though that seven-goal margin of victory was the one United would emulate. But Martial's 90th-minute second - the first time he has scored two in a game all season - took the home side beyond that, and James completed the rout in the third minute of injury time. Rashford and McTominay both produced noteworthy strikes for a United side that also had a penalty award overturned just before half-time. Making a full Premier League debut should be a cause for celebration in any young player's career. For Jankewitz, it was a catastrophic experience. His second-minute foul on McTominay was committed right in front of Saints boss Ralph Hassenhuttl, who did not require the replays which made the challenge look worse with every viewing. Hassenhuttl could only throw his arms up in the air in disbelief, knowing referee Mike Dean had no alternative other than to show the 19-year-old Swiss midfielder a straight red card. The incident came less than a week after Jankewitz's agent had started murmurings about a transfer and this sorry episode is unlikely to convince anyone the player has a future at St Mary's. After that, it was just a question of how long the visitors could survive, which turned out to be not very long, as Wan-Bissaka turned in Luke Shaw's cross at the far post from a position Jankewitz should have been defending. With Bednarek among the scorers after turning Rashford's cross into his own net for the third, and one of those marginal video assistant referee offside decisions that took away the goal Che Adams thought he had scored at the start of the second half, it really was one of those nights best erased from the memory completely. Unfortunately, that was not the end of the misery. While Hassenhuttl can rightly point to Jankewitz's dismissal as the key moment, there can be no excusing the way the team - though badly affected by injuries - had so totally collapsed by the end. Manchester United manager Solskjaer speaking to BBC Sport: ""When they had a man sent off it was up to us to get the first goal. ""You have to take your chances in tight or open games - you never know what might be the deciding factor. We know, better than anyone, what goal difference can do to you because we have lost the league on goal difference. ""Confidence is one thing but it was about the mojo and spark - the X-factor."" Southampton boss Hasenhuttl speaking to BBC Sport: ""One man down after three minutes against this opponent - congratulations to Manchester United, they worked us off and did not stop scoring. The second red card is most disappointing - we don't have any more players. ""We tried in the second half to keep a clean sheet as much as we could, but at nine men it was too easy for them to score. ""What can I say? It is horrible. But we stood up after the first 9-0 [against Leicester] and we have to do that again.""

13,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50092694,Southampton 0-9 Leicester City: Foxes equal record for biggest Premier League win,"Leicester City equalled the 24-year-old record for the biggest ever Premier League victory as 10-man Southampton were dismantled at a rainswept St Mary's. The victory sees Brendan Rodgers' side climb into second place, leapfrogging Manchester City and moving five points behind leaders Liverpool. The result, which matches Manchester United's 9-0 win against Ipswich in 1995, was only confirmed in stoppage time thanks to Jamie Vardy's penalty. Both Vardy and Ayoze Perez scored hat-tricks, with the visitors aided by Ryan Bertrand's red card for a reckless challenge on Perez in the build-up to Ben Chilwell's opener. That opened the floodgates for Leicester, who turned on the style just two days before the first anniversary of the helicopter crash that killed the club's former chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and four other people. Youri Tielemans also scored his third goal of the campaign and James Maddison added a superb free-kick on a miserable evening for Southampton, who drop into the bottom three. On a landmark night, Leicester also: Leicester 'here to stay at top' - Chilwell Saints boss Hasenhuttl takes '100% responsibility' for defeat Leicester may have played a game more than Liverpool but this emphatic result means that they have now scored more goals than the league leaders and are just four behind Manchester City. And the omens look good for Rodgers' side who have now collected one point more from the opening 10 games of the current season than at the same stage of their title-winning campaign in 2015-16. With trips to Crystal Palace and Brighton on the horizon either side of hosting Arsenal, Leicester have every chance to kick on from their strong start, but given the strength and form of Liverpool and Manchester City, a title challenge appears unlikely. But the manner in which the Foxes ruthlessly cut through the hosts will nevertheless serve as a warning to others, with their three goals inside the opening 19 minutes the fastest they have amassed that scoreline in a Premier League match since 1998. Also working in Leicester's favour is the attacking menace still being provided by Vardy. While the forward is approaching his 33rd birthday, there are few signs, if any, that his physical capabilities are waning and he looked as sprightly as ever as he recorded his first hat-trick for almost three years. His first showed nimbleness and awareness as he cut inside Saints defender Maya Yoshida to drill a close-range effort into the bottom corner, while his second showcased smart movement as he headed past Angus Gunn from close range. His trademark blistering pace then took him clear of the Southampton defence to win and convert a late penalty. His exploits were also complemented by Perez, who opened his account for the season after finding the bottom-right corner following a neat one-two with Tielemans. The Spaniard then superbly swept home Chilwell's pinpoint cross for his second before finding the bottom corner with a left-footed shot to complete his treble. At the start of the evening Southampton's focus was purely on ending a barren run of seven games without a home win dating back to April. But by half-time manager Ralph Hasenhuttl had changed tack considerably, by simply trying to avoid any further embarrassment. The Austrian, who at times appeared exasperated and spent much of the interval sitting in his technical area, introduced Kevin Danso and Jack Stephens to replace Jannik Vestergaard and Danny Ings, but it was too little to late. With the crowd visibly thinning in the second period, Hasenhuttl must now hope the scale of this defeat has not eroded the confidence of his players too much. While the Saints are a couple of points better off than at the same time last term, they appear in danger of being dragged into another relegation fight. And their road to redemption is unlikely to be an easy one with their next two fixtures away at Manchester City in both the Carabao Cup and Premier League. Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""I'm very pleased to see our work rate, we scored some great goals and we were very hungry tonight. It was horrible weather but our focus was outstanding. I'm very pleased how we defended, and we were ruthless. I'm very proud to stand and be the manager of that team. ""We wanted to get the ball back quickly and attack again. A mark of the good sides is you don't let up. We wanted to show we're a good side and we certainly did that in the second half. ""We were ruthlessly simple in our game. When you're so many goals up you can easily slow but we kept focused. We want to be a top team and to be a top team you must be clinical. ""It was a very good team performance and we're pleased to keep a clean sheet. It's good for our goals for but the clean sheet is equally important."" Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""That was one of the tough ones tonight. The performance was a disaster today and I have to apologies and take 100% responsibility - I've never seen a team act like this, there was no fight for anything. ""It was horrible to watch and everyone who stayed to watch is really a fan of this football club. Leicester were in every part of the game better than us I'm a proud man but the way we play today is not the way I want to see my team play. We must get our heads up and that is my job in the next few days. ""I said we must play to the last minute but I can understand why the fans that left. We all must to do everything to pull this back. I haven't looked at the [Ryan Bertrand] red card but it doesn't make any difference in this moment."" On what was said after the game: ""There is nothing I want to speak of here in front of the camera - we keep that for in the dressing room.""

14,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963575,Doncaster Rovers 2-0 Crewe Alexandra: David Artell's side relegated from League One,"Crewe Alexandra have been relegated from League One following Saturday's defeat by Doncaster Rovers. Tommy Rowe and Josh Martin scored either side of half-time to condemn the Alex to their eighth successive loss - and their 15th in 16 games. Crewe were only promoted to the third tier in 2019-20 but, after finishing 12th last season, have now suffered relegation with four matches still to play. Rovers, 23rd in the table, boosted their own survival hopes by halting a six-game winless run with a victory that leaves them five points from safety. Crewe had remained in touch with the teams above them and were only four points adrift when they beat Charlton on 12 January - but they have taken just four points from the 51 available since then. David Artell's side go down having clocked up just six league wins - crucially just four of them at home, as was the case the last time they got relegated back to League Two under Steve Davis in 2016. The defeat by Rovers also means they have lost eight games in a row for the first time since 1982. Crewe manager David Artell told BBC Radio Stoke: ""I can only apologise to the fans for the season we've had, it's been a season to forget for lots of reasons and it culminates in this afternoon. I've learnt more in this last 12 months than I had in the previous four-and-a-half years without a shadow of a doubt. ""I'm number one in the firing line as responsibility travels upwards and the fact that none of the fans were having a go at any of the players shows the good job I do at protecting the lads. I'm going to carry on until somebody tells me otherwise; we've rebuilt once and we'll do it again, I can promise people that."" Graham McGarry, BBC Radio Stoke's Crewe Alexandra reporter since 1988 The current managerial team and the squad of Crewe Alexandra players will look back on the 2021-2022 season as one of the worst in the modern-day history of the club. Unfortunately the team's poor performances have led to many unwanted statistics, which are now associated to this group. But the loss of their League One status is top of that list. The departure of five players who featured heavily last season all to Championship clubs, dreadful recruitment, long-term injuries, and the switching of systems and personnel far too often have all played a part in why Crewe are swapping Charlton for Colchester come next August. At any other club than Crewe, with such a shocking set of results, the manager would have been fired. But it looks pretty certain that David Artell will be handed the opportunity to lead a massive rebuilding programme - and he will need to hit the ground running in August or he may not be around to celebrate a sixth year in charge.
