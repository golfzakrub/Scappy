The match was billed as a title decider, with City leading Jurgen Klopp’s side by just a point heading into the final few weeks of the season. Kevin De Bruyne got the hosts off to the perfect start, Diogo Jota equalised for Liverpool before Gabriel Jesus then restored the lead going into break. Sadio Mane got the Reds back on terms seconds after the restart and neither side could find a winner that would have been a potentially decisive moment in the title race. City’s one-point lead remains with seven matches to go, and the teams will meet again next weekend at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-final. It was a breathless start at the Etihad, with Raheem Sterling missing a huge chance to put City in front. De Bruyne did score seconds later though to give the home side the lead inside five minutes. A free-kick was taken quickly, the Belgian drove forward with the ball and his shot from distance took a big deflection off Joel Matip and found the far corner. Liverpool looked ragged in the early stages but settled themselves and were back on terms less than ten minutes later. Andy Robertson’s deep cross found his fellow full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, who on the volley cut the ball ball perfectly for Jota and he made no mistake. Both sides continued to offer a real threat, with space in behind regularly on offer. De Bruyne nearly got his second of the match, but dragged the effort wide. Pep Guardiola’s side restored their lead though before the break through Jesus. Joao Cancelo curled a superb cross to the back post, where the Brazilian had made a great run and he then lifted the ball over Alisson and into the back of the net with the help of the underside of the bar. Jota should have got Liverpool back level again but took to long when through on goal, before Aymeric Laporte hit the post seconds before the break, though the offside flag then went up. It took less than 60 seconds of the second-half for Liverpool to equalise again. Mohamed Salah played a lovely through ball for Mane and he slotted the first-time finish past Ederson emphatically. In an increasingly frantic encounter, City very nearly took the lead for a third time. Jesus cut inside onto his left foot, beat Alisson with the strike only to find Virgil van Dijk was behind his goalkeeper to clear the danger. Just after the hour mark, City did have the ball in the net again as Raheem Sterling cooly slotted through the legs of the Liverpool goalkeeper, but it was ruled out by VAR for offside. Salah curled a deflected strike just wide of the far post, before Jesus drilled an effort into the side-netting from a tight angle as both sides pushed for a winner. Riyad Mahrez came off the bench and fired a free-kick that flicked off the outside of the post as the clock ticked into stoppage-time. The Algerian was then played through in the final seconds and had a massive chance to win it, but looped his shot over the bar. It finished level, a result that looks set to ensure the title race goes down to the wire, but it’s City who have the edge going into the final stretch of the season. ",positive,liverpool,6

The top four may be beyond David Moyes’s side but they are still well in the running for another Europa League finish. If they are to do that, however, they must learn to cope with the rigors of Thursday-Sunday at the business end of the season and punish those who slip up - just as rivals Manchester United and Arsenal did in defeat this weekend. Instead, West Ham looked a shadow of the side which has got them to within a shot of another remarkable season as Thomas Frank’s buzzing Bees completed a League double over the Hammers thanks to goals from Bryan Mbuemo and Ivan Toney. Having played 45 minutes with just 10 men on Thursday night, West Ham were sluggish from the off here - the Bees quicker to everything in midfield and more direct going forward. Lukasz Fabianski twice saved from the energetic Mbuemo, first a header from Rico Henry’s well placed cross before the Pole palmed away a left-footed strike. West Ham were struggling to make things happen in the Brentford half, only coming close when Tomas Soucek steered a header straight at David Raya from Vladimir Coufal’s cross. Moyes’ frustration grew when, on the half hour mark, Kurt Zouma fell to the ground in his own box and was forced off having been unable to recover from a challenge by Christian Norgaard five minutes earlier. The Scot watched on baffled as Brentford found it easy to force openings and would have been ready to explode had Vladimir Coufal’s header over his own bar from Christian Eriksen’s free-kick been an inch or two lower. Fabianski had to be alive to everything as the Bees continued to push the visitors - the former Arsenal man diving low to stop an Eriksen effort from the edge of the box. Moyes tried to lift his players at the break but they were just as slack early in the second half, as Toney’s flick from Kristoffer Ajer’s throw-in caught Issa Diop and Aaron Cresswell napping and created the opener. Having threatened before the break but lacked the cutting edge to take his chances, Mbuemo did not let this one go to waste and fired home at the near post to score his first Premier League goal since December. Moyes responded quickly, sending Said Benrahma on against his former club, but the Hammers still lacked any cutting edge and they were quickly falling apart at the back too. Despite having caused so much trouble through the first hour, Mbuemo was left unmarked at the far post as he met another Henry cross, this time turning it back for Toney to head home his eighth Premier League goal since the turn of the year. It should have been three moments later when, after a chaotic spell of pinball in the West Ham box, Mbuemo could only fire over. With Thursday’s trip to France in mind and West Ham struggling to lay a glove on their hosts, Moyes withdrew the ineffectual Michail Antonio and seemed resigned to defeat. The Hammers have largely coped well with their European exertions so far this season, but here they looked cooked from the start. Having failed to take advantage of their top six rivals slipping up on Saturday, they must ensure they step up the energy on Thursday or they may well have lost the battle on both fronts in the space of five days.

Brentford created the better chances across a rather flat first half which also saw West Ham lose Kurt Zouma to injury. West Ham had been sluggish before the break and were not alive to Bryan Mbuemo sneaking behind the back line early after the interval as the forward fired home his first League goal since December. The forward then laid on a cushioned cross for Ivan Toney to head home Brentford’s second and ensure a League double over West Ham for the Bees this season. Here is how Jack Rosser rated the Hammers... SPONSORED Lukasz Fabianski 6 Brentford could have been out of sight were it not for Fabiasnki’s saves in the first half. Vladimir Coufal 5 Making his first start since surgery earlier this year. Struggled to get forward and make any real impact. Craig Dawson 7 Battled on after a whack to the face in the opening minutes. Didn’t do much wrong and put a superb challenge in on Toney to prevent a third for the Bees. Kurt Zouma 6 A couple of clearances early on before being forced off injured. Aaron Cresswell 5 Tormented by Mbuemo for most of the afternoon and was pinned back by the Brentford winger so could not get forward. Tomas Soucek 5 Sent one soft header straight at David Raya. Largely bypassed in midfield. Declan Rice 6 Not at his usual high level but worked to get West Ham moving in the second half. Cut a frustrated figure. Jarrod Bowen 5 Could not add to his tally of two goals in two games. Struggled to get past Rico Henry down the right. Manuel Lanzini 5 First game back after being involved in a car crash and struggled to make an impact before being hooked before the hour mark. Pablo Fornals 5 Worked as hard as always but offered very little going forward. Michail Antonio 4 Dominated by the Brentford defenders and did not cause the trouble he had managed in recent weeks. Substitutes Issa Diop 6 Didn’t do too much wrong but left too much space for Mbuemo and Toney for Brentford’s second. Said Benrahma 6 A couple of nice moves on the ball - the only West Ham forward to really stretch Brentford. Nikola Vlasic 5 Made almost no impact off the bench. ,positive,liverpool,0

Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall proved the star of the show to send Brendan Rodgers’ side ninth. Dewsbury-Hall picked up the ball in midfield and threaded a well-timed pass for winger Ademola Lookman, who fired past Palace goalkeeper Vicente Guaita with 10 minutes remaining in the first half to score his first goal since February. Palace defender Marc Guehi miscontrolled the ball in his own half, allowing Leicester forward Patson Daka to find Dewsbury-Hall. The midfielder curled a powerful shot from 18 yards to score his first Premier League goal seconds before halftime. Wilfried Zaha gave Leicester reason to sweat after halving the deficit in the 65th minute, heading in the rebound from his retaken penalty after his first attempt was saved by Kasper Schmeichel. Palace were awarded a spot-kick when Youri Tielemans tripped Jordan Ayew and Schmeichel had pushed away Zaha’s effort but the penalty was retaken following a VAR check which spotted encroachment from Leicester defender Caglar Soyuncu. Leicester weathered the visitors’ attacking spells to see out the win and move into ninth in the league standings with 40 points and two games in hand over Palace, who are three points behind in 10th place.

For the second weekend running, Spurs romped to a four-goal win, beating Aston Villa 4-0 thanks to clinical hat-trick from Heung-min Son. The visitors were far from dominant throughout and had to withstand a first-half battering from Villa, who missed a string of chances and forced Hugo Lloris into no fewer than seven sharp saves before the interval, three of which were brilliant. But, just as against Newcastle last weekend, Spurs blew their opponents away after the break, Dejan Kulusevski also scoring. Ominously for Spurs’ rivals, both for this season’s top four and long-term, this is still not a team capable of playing Conte’s football for a full 90 minutes but when they do turn it out, they are near enough unstoppable, thanks to a clinical front three of Son, Harry Kane and Kulusevski who are increasingly making a claim to be the League’s most dangerous trio. Villa did not do much wrong, and played some intricate, high-tempo football at times, but Spurs’ were simply too good in the final third. As in the 5-1 thrashing of Newcastle, Kane did not score but was nonetheless hugely influential, assisting Spurs’ second and third goals at the start of the second half with brilliant headers. The first was a brave win in the air against Ezri Konsa, with Kulusevski then arrowing a super finish into the far corner for the real sucker-punch. The second was a superb flick into the channel for Son to run clear and beat Emi Martinez one-on-one with a cool finish. Kulusevski also assisted Son’s third with a neat cutback. What a signing the Swede is proving to be. But as well as another demonstration of their firepower, this win was also a test of Spurs’ mettle as they withstood a ferocious spell of Villa pressure, which lasted from Son’s stunning third-minute strike until the final seconds of the first half, when Lloris clawed away Philippe Coutinho’s free-kick. While Spurs rode their luck, they also fought determinedly and showed no signs of the soft underbelly which characterised the squad before Conte’s appointment. Their defending of set pieces was also impressive and notably better than at the start of the year when they were susceptible from corners and free-kicks. Arsenal’s defeat to Brighton, their second loss on the bounce, and Everton’s win over Manchester United made this a huge opportunity for Spurs to put themselves firmly in control of their own destiny but they showed no indication they were feeling the pressure. Spurs should now be considered firm favourites for the last Champions League place and, encouragingly, it still feels as though they are just getting started. Lloris stands up It was easy to overlook another Lloris mistake after Tottenham’s devastating second-half display in last weekend’s hammering of Newcastle. The goalkeeper weakly allowed Fabian Schar’s freekick to sneak inside the post, continuing a spell of poor form since he agreed a new contract in January. So perhaps Spurs were overdue a big performance from their captain, who was as important to this victory as Son with an inspired performance. The Frenchman made seven first half saves, including spectacular one-handed stops to deny Jacob Ramsey and John McGinn. According to Opta, it was the most saves by any goalkeeper in the first half of any Premier League match since 2006-07, reflecting Villa’s dominance and Lloris’ brilliance. He finished the first half by clawing Coutinho’s opportunistic free-kick off the line, summing up the first 45 minutes. Villa were the better side but could not beat Spurs’ final line of defence. Lloris has been guilty of errors in important matches but this was a big performance from the goalkeeper when it mattered, ensuring his team went in ahead at half time and could ultimately capitalise on Arsenal’s defeat. Furious Hojbjerg relishes the battle Tottenham’s unsung hero in the middle of the park was Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. The Dane can scarcely have taken such a kicking in his career, with Villa’s ultra-physical press especially targeting him in the first half. But he stood up to the challenge magnificently, riding challenge after challenge, even as he appeared to grow increasingly furious with the lack of protection from the referee. Hojbjerg has struggled for consistency this season but he has been excellent for Spurs in the last few games, and after last week’s win over Newcastle Conte singled him out for praise unprompted in his post-match press conference. His performance here was even better than against the Toon, particularly as Rodrigo Bentancur struggled with Villa’s intensity before the break. Conte continues to be frustrated by the absence of Oliver Skipp but Hojbjerg’s form is ensuring Spurs remain strong in the middle of the park without the England U-21 international.

Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney scored in the second-half, with the Hammers managing just a single shot on target in the entire 90 minutes. West Ham came into the match off the back of a tough 1-1 draw against Lyon in the Europa League and have the second-leg to come on Thursday, and they will have to put in a much better performance in France than they managed at the Brentford Community Stadium. “No I don’t have any complaints, we weren’t at it from the start,” Moyes told BBC Sport. “There are mitigating circumstances, we had a tough game on Thursday and the Thursday-Sunday schedule is not ideal. The most part has been good but today felt like one too many. “I said to the lads I don’t remember giving anything of quality for their goalkeeper to do.

The sides played out a thrilling 2-2 draw at the Etihad, with City twice going ahead but Liverpool were able to peg them back on both occasions. It leaves City with a one-point advantage at the top of the table with seven league matches remaining and Guardiola believes his side will have to win every single one of them if they want to lift the trophy once again. “It was a good advert for the Premier League - fantastic game, both teams trying to win,” Guardiola said. “Unfortunately we could not win. I have the feeling that we let them leave alive from here, but Liverpool are a joy to watch. The players they have up front, how difficult they are, no doubt about that. “I’m so incredibly proud of my team. Now both teams know seven games left, you have to win all of them or it will be over. “It didn’t matter what happened - win, lose or draw this isn’t over. I would have said the same in defeat or victory. “Of course it was an important massive game, but we know what we have to do.” Both teams are in Champions League action midweek and lead after the first-legs of their quarter-final ties, though City look to have a more challenging task on their hands as they travel to face Atletico Madrid with just a narrow advantage. Attention will then turn to Wembley and the FA Cup, as City face Liverpool next weekend in the semi-finals in what looks set to be another sensational encounter. ",positive,liverpool,4

The Reds had to twice come from behind, with Diogo Jota cancelling out Kevin De Bruyne’s early opener and Sadio Mane then getting the visitors back on terms after Gabriel Jesus had restored the lead. There could very easily have been more goals in a game that both sides threw everything at, and it leaves City with a one-point lead at the top of the table with seven games remaining. Klopp’s side know that it’s City who have the narrow advantage, but the German was more than satisfied with what he saw from his players. “What a game, wild.” Klopp said. “We can describe this as like a boxing fight. If you had your arms down for a second you get a massive knock, you shake a little bit and then it comes from the other team. “I liked a lot of things. When we played football and controlled the game, we played simple passes and were really dangerous. “When we tried to breathe a little bit, they came back. A great game, and a result we have to live with and can. “The intensity of the game was crazy - all of them were standing there like ‘what was that’. It was good fun, I liked it.” On paper, Liverpool’s run-in is more difficult but they may well need to win all of their remaining seven league matches if they want to win the title. There was no doubt in Klopp’s answer when he was asked if Liverpool were still able to catch an exceptional City side. “They are (exceptional) but I wanted them to see my boys are exceptional as well,” Klopp said. “I saw that today and I’m really happy about that. Seven games to go for both teams, we will not stop chasing - that’s clear.” ",positive,liverpool,3

The strain of having to play with ten men for the entirety of the second-half was all too obvious in David Moyes’ side, who rarely got going. Two second-half goals lifted the Bees 12 points clear of the Premier League drop zone after a Sunday afternoon stroll in the west London sunshine. Bryan Mbeumo lashed in the opener after being teed up by Ivan Toney, and then returned the favour for his strike partner as Toney grabbed his 14th goal of the season. For West Ham it was another dent in their fading hopes of a top-four finish, and they were also dealt a potentially massive blow with Thursday night’s Europa League second leg against Lyon in mind when defender Kurt Zouma was forced to limp out of the action midway through the first half. Zouma had taken a hefty kick to the ankle from Christian Norgaard five minutes earlier and seemingly failed to shake off the knock. The France international, still roundly booed by opposition fans following his cat-kicking video shame, left the field to a chorus of ‘put him down’ from the Bees supporters. Brentford were still buzzing from last weekend’s thumping 4-1 win at Chelsea and Mbeumo had the game’s first effort on target when he headed Rico Henry’s cross straight at Lukasz Fabianski. The lively forward then tested West Ham’s Polish keeper further with a fierce drive at the near post. Then, when Fabianski punched a Christian Eriksen corner which was threatening to curl straight in, Mbeumo lashed the rebound over the crossbar. Eriksen grew into the match as the first half wore on and his free-kick was headed narrowly over his own crossbar by Vladimir Coufal before Fabianski held the Dane’s low, skidding drive. West Ham, perhaps showing the effect of Thursday night’s first-leg exertions, threatened only once in the opening half when Tomas Soucek headed a cross from fellow Czech Coufal into the arms of Bees keeper David Raya. Mbeumo got his reward two minutes into the second half when he latched on to Toney’s clever flick and lashed a fierce angled shot past Fabianski. It was the French forward’s fourth goal of the season and his first since December. Moyes sent on Said Benrahma to face his old club, but before the Algerian could get a meaningful touch, Brentford doubled their advantage with a slick move. Yoane Wissa fed Henry down the left and the full-back’s cross was steered back across goal by Mbeumo for Toney to head in the simplest of finishes and wrap up a deserved win.

Callum Hudson-Odoi (back) and Ben Chilwell (knee) are unavailable with Timo Werner pushing for a start after a brace on the south coast.

Both Graham Potter’s side and Crystal Palace inflicted potentially terminal blows to Arsenal’s Champions League hopes as rivals Tottenham moved three points clear into fourth spot. Between Monday’s defeat at Selhurst Park and the loss at the Emirates six days later, Mikel Arteta also lost the services of first-team stars Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey with both unlikely to play again this season. While Arsenal do have a game in hand on Spurs, the manner of their recent performances - combined with their injury blows - make it difficult to imagine they will overturn Antonio Conte’s resurgent team, at least not without a significant improvement. With Chelsea and Manchester United to play before the end of April and a huge north London derby to come in May, Arteta needs a quick-fire reaction from his young team. Speaking after the game, Ramsdale said: “This was supposed to be the reaction game but it wasn’t. We’ve lost and not managed to pick up any points and next week is even bigger. “I think we just need to go out there and be free and play our game, you know? It’s a game of football and I think in the first half we were very tense and slow so we just need to go out there next week, trust what the manager and the coaching staff are saying and go and play our football, which we’ve done all season.” ",negative,liverpool,0

The Welsh international made his first competitive appearance inside the Santiago Bernabeu in over two years when he replaced Karim Benzema during a 2-0 win over Getafe. In the past Bale, who joined Madrid from Tottenham Hotspur in 2013 for a then-record transfer fee of 100 million euros, has had run-ins with the club’s management and almost left in 2020 after he fell out of favour with then manager Zinedine Zidane. Recently, however, he has suffered multiple fitness setbacks and the fans and as well as local media have turned on him. ""The booing is understandable but our fans need to understand that their support is very important too,"" Real coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters. ""Yes, Bale was booed but he is a serious professional, he is doing well in training and if necessary he will play this final stretch of the season. The fans have to understand that."" Bale recently hit out at Spanish newspaper Marca for comparing him to a ""parasite"" over claims that he was sucking money out of the Spanish club. He was also accused by Madrid media of faking a back injury after he missed Real Madrid’s 4-0 defeat by Barcelona but then showed up for his country just four days later to score two goals as Wales beat Austria in a World Cup playoff game. But Bale, who came on as a substitute midway through the second half on Saturday, still has the backing of his Madrid team mates. ""We all are with Bale,"" said Real Madrid captain Marcelo. ""It is difficult, it has happened to many people at Santiago Bernabeu that has a very demanding fanbase but we are all important. ""We are at the end of the season, we have a lot at stake, we have to help each other. It’s sad but we all have to go out there and give our best.""

The Republic of Ireland international was forced off after only 21 minutes of Tottenham’s big away win at Aston Villa and was seen leaving the ground with a brace on his knee. Saturday’s win at Villa Park took Spurs three points clear of bitter rivals Arsenal to solidify their position in the Premier League’s top four, although Mikel Arteta’s side have a game in hand. Doherty, despite a largely unhappy time of things since joining Spurs from Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2020, has established himself as a key player under Conte. Able to operate on both the and the left hand side of defence, the wing-back has scored twice and registered three assists in his last seven Premier League games, finding a new lease of life as Spurs chase Champions League qualification. With Conte’s system relying so heavily on that particular position, the idea of missing Doherty - who the Italian has praised in recent weeks - is a worry. Speaking after the game, Conte said: “Matt tried to continue to stay on the pitch. “This showed his resilience, his desire to continue to play. I hope it’s nothing serious, because we need him. Now, we have to wait one day, two days, and the doctors have to check him. I don’t think it’s anything serious, I hope.” ",positive,liverpool,0

As the striker walked off the pitch after the 1-0 defeat at Goodison Park, footage seemingly showed Ronaldo slapping a phone out of a fan’s hand that left it broken on the ground. Reports after the match suggested that United were looking into the incident, and Ronaldo has now taken to Instagram to address the situation and offer the fan involved tickets to a match at Old Trafford. “It’s never easy to deal with emotions in difficult moments such as the one we are facing. “Nevertheless, we always have to be respectful, patient and set the example for all the youngsters who love the beautiful game. “I would like to apologise for my outburst and, if possible, I would like to invite this supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford as a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship.” David De Gea labelled United ‘a disgrace’ after the defeat at Goodison Park, against an Everton side that went into the match sorely lacking in form and confidence. It almost certainly brings an end to United’s hopes of Champions League football next season. They trail Tottenham in fourth by six points, with seven Premier League matches. What is less certain is what happens at United this summer - Ralf Rangnick will almost certainly not be in charge beyond the end of the current campaign, with the focus now on appointing a new interim boss.

United struggled in the 63 minutes that followed and were unable to find an equaliser, against an Everton side that had lost five of their last six matches in all competitions. It’s a defeat that surely ends United’s hopes of Champions League football next season, as they now trail Tottenham by six points, and De Gea was less than impressed with what the visitors produced against Frank Lampard’s side. “We don’t score, we don’t even create proper chances to score,” De Gea said. “I don’t know what to say, to be honest.

Both Manchester United and Arsenal lost earlier in the day, and Spurs took full advantage as they beat Aston Villa 4-0 and moved three points clear in fourth. Heung-min Son scored a hat-trick in the ruthless win, with Dejan Kulusevski also on the scoresheet, and Conte hailed his side’s killer instinct in seizing the moment. “We have to look at ourselves - a strong team doesn’t depend on others,” Conte said. “We have to understand the moment to kill the opponent. Today was an important moment, especially because other results were good for us. “It was good because we won. If we don’t win, it’s not useful to look at the results of the other teams. “The winner has to feel when there is the blood of your opponents and then you have to try to kill them.” Tottenham were sensational in the second-half at Villa Park but they had to ride out some tricky moments in the first 45 minutes, with the home side well on top during the opening period. A combination of Hugo Lloris and some poor finishing meant Villa trailed at the break, and Conte was impressed with the resilience his side displayed. “I have to be pleased to see this commitment, this attention and this accuracy in every situation,” Conte said. “The first half was very tough because Aston Villa brought high intensity and tried to put a good pressure on us. We showed a great consistency to be solid and at the same time, when we were in possession to score goals. “For sure a good moment for us. The hard work that we did this month was important.

Son’s third-minute strike put the visitors ahead but Villa dominated the rest of the first-half, pegging Spurs into their third and peppering Hugo Lloris’ goal with efforts. Villa were made to pay for their profligacy, however, as Spurs stepped up a gear in the second half, Dejan Kulusevski scoring five minutes after the interval before Son completely his treble with two cool finishes to move Spurs three points clear in fourth place. Dan Kilpatrick was at Villa Park to rate the Spurs players... Hugo Lloris 9 Magnificent display to keep out Villa in the first half, making seven saves in total, including spectacular one-handed effors to deny Jacob Ramsey and John McGinn. Nearly punished for a sloppy late pass out but had done his job. Cristian Romero 8 Relished the physical battle, particularly his duels with Brazilian Philippe Coutinho. Much improved at defending set pieces in last few matches and made the third goal with an angle pass for Kane. Eric Dier 8 Under the cosh in the first half but helped Spurs come through unscathed with some brave blocks and challenges. Ben Davies 8 Played his part in a committed rearguard, and appeared particularly vocal when Spurs when were under pressure. Emerson Royal 6 Had a tough job against Lucas Digne, Ollie Watkins and Coutinho, who drifted to the left in the first half. Committed but unpolished, particularly on the ball. Rodrigo Bentancur 7 Uncharacteristically flustered in the first half in the face of Villa’s onslaught but more composed after the break, as Spurs turned the screw. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg 8 Rarely can he have taken such a kicking! Coped well with Villa’s physical approach in another impressive display, particularly as he picked up an early booking and had to walk a tightrope to avoid a second. Matt Doherty 5 Tried to play on after a crunching early challenge by Matty Cash but eventually forced off. A shame for him given his recent resurgence. Dejan Kulusevski 9 Another goal -- a brilliant low finish for the sucker punch -- and assisted Son. Decisive. Hard to think of many better January signings in Premier League history. Heung-min Son 10 Scored a clinical hat-trick of sublime finishes, each one in the corner and unsavable. On this form, he is one of the League’s most dangerous and instinctive finishers. Harry Kane 9 Just as against Newcastle last weekend, he didn’t score but was the creative hub for Spurs, finishing with two great headed asssists. The first was a great win in the air against Ezri Konsa, the second a sublime into the channel for Son. He was also involved in the first goal with his blocked shot falling for Son. Subs Sergio Reguilon (Doherty 21’) 7 Got stuck in and defended well but did not have many chances to get forward. When he did, at the end of the first half, nearly forced Tyrone Mings into an own goal. Lucas Moura (Son 78’) 6 Gave Son a breather -- and a standing ovation -- and helped Spurs to see out the game. Steven Bergwijn (Kulusevski 84’) 6 Had a couple of glimpses in the box but could not score from the bench again. ",positive,liverpool,0

Premier League result, match stream and latest updates today","ston Villa vs Tottenham - LIVE! Heung-min Son struck a superbly taken hat-trick as Tottenham Hotspur took a grip on fourth place, cruising to a 4-0 win at Aston Villa in the Premier League. With Arsenal losing earlier on Saturday, Spurs have a three point lead over their North London rivals, though the Gunners have played one game less. South Korean Son fired Spurs ahead in the third minute when a blocked shot from Harry Kane fell to him on the edge of the box and his first time, left-foot, shot flew in off the inside of the post. Villa then had a host of chances to get level but a combination of wasteful finishing and inspired goalkeeping from Hugo Lloris ensured Spurs went in with the lead at the break. Kane then created the second for Spurs in the 50th minute, flicking on a long ball into the path of Dejan Kulusevski who burst into the box and beat Emiliano Martinez with a low shot. There was a similar pattern to the third goal with Kane cleverly flicking on another long pass right into the stride of Son who ran goalwards before providing a clinical finish to make sure of a fourth win in a row for Spurs. Son completed his hat-trick when, from the right flank, he found Kulusevski inside and the Swedish forward unselfishly returned the pass to the South Korean who drilled home off the post. “It’s tough - the scoreline is harsh on us, but it’s the reality and we have to accept that. I have to accept it - I’m responsible. The story of the game certainly wasn’t a 4-0 game. “It’s the first time in football I’ve gone off at half-time 1-0 down and been really happy and proud, we were magnificent, we didn’t take our chances but at half-time I said if we can continue this I have no doubt we get back into the game. “The second half it flipped, Spurs’ quality players made it about our backline and they punished us really heavily.” Seven Premier League matches to go this season for Tottenham - they’re in a great position. Three points clear in fourth place now. Arsenal do have a game in hand, though that’s not an easy one. A trip to Stamford Bridge is the assignment. Then of course there’s that north London derby in the penultimate week of the season. Very much advantage Spurs at this stage. Job done and in some style from Tottenham! Had to ride their luck in the first-half and could easily have been behind going into the break, but they held firm and then ran riot in the second-half. Hat-trick for Son... that Spurs front three is in sublime form. 90+1 mins: Four minutes added on - not sure Villa will be thrilled to see that. Watkins plays a low ball into the box, Romero hammers it behind for a corner. Kane earns a yellow card, who slid in on Bailey earlier in the move trying to stop the counter. 89 mins: Should be 4-1! Lloris with a dreadful pass, makes a complete mess of it and Bailey has a big chance to give Villa a consolation. Loses his balance though and it’s curled wide. 88 mins: Another lovely move from Spurs. Reguilon plays it into Bergwijn with a nutmeg, and he then tries to dink it into the path of Royal who was completely free. Just too much on it though. Wing-back was completely free. 86 mins: Young cuts inside, whips a cross into the box. Big shout of ‘keeper’ from Lloris and Davies just about gets out of the way in time for the Frenchman to claim.

With Manchester United and Arsenal both losing earlier in the day, the chance was there for Spurs to take control of the Premier League top-four race and take a big step towards securing Champions League football. They did just that, as Heung-min Son netted a superb hat-trick and Dejan Kulusevski also got himself on the scoresheet. There were plenty of troubling moments in the first-half for Spurs, but they came through them before taking complete control through their front three. It takes them three points clear in fourth, having played a game more than Arsenal. That much for the Gunners is away to Chelsea though, and the north London rivals meet at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium later in the season. It took less than three minutes for Spurs to take the lead as they made the perfect start. Harry Kane’s scuffed volley bounced off Matty Cash and fortuitously into the path of Son, but there was nothing lucky about the finish as he swept the shot off the inside of the post and into the bottom corner. For the rest of the first-half, Villa were utterly dominant, but a combination of Hugo Lloris and poor finishing kept them behind. Jacob Ramsey drifted past a couple of challenges and into the box, and his shot was brilliantly tipped over the bar by Lloris. The Frenchman then kept John McGinn’s long-range strike out, before Danny Ings sent a tame volley straight at him. Ollie Watkins headed over from close range and Ings then missed arguably the biggest chance. A cross was flicked on by Tyrone Mings perfectly into the striker’s path, but he scuffed an effort into his standing foot and it dribbled wide. There was still time for Cash to have a volley saved, and Lloris to then just about stop a Philippe Coutinho free-kick crossing the line on the verge of half-time. In absolutely ruthless fashion, Spurs doubled their lead five minutes after the break to take control. Kane flicked on a long ball into the path of Kulusevski, who from a tight angle inside the box rifled a left-footed strike into the far corner. That stunned Villa, after their superb first-half showing, and it could have been three for Spurs soon after had Son not taken a heavy touch that allowed Emi Martinez to rush off his line and gather the ball. Son made up for it though with 25 minutes remaining to get his second of the match and put the result beyond doubt. As ever Kane was involved, flicking on the ball perfectly for his teammate and Son made no mistake when clean through on goal. Five minutes later, the match-ball was secured. Son flicked it through to Kulusevski, who got to the byline and played the ball back into the path of the South Korean who found the far corner with the help of the woodwork. Those first-half struggles looked a world away, as Spurs’ free-scoring nature continued and it is Antonio Conte’s side who look well on course to secure Champions League football next season.

Off the back of a damaging week following losses to Brentford and Real Madrid, the pressure was on the European champions to cement their place in the Premier League’s top four. But two goals each from Timo Werner and Mason Mount in a dominant display wiped away concerns about a loss of form going into the crucial part of the season. “It tells us that we’re not the team to escape with results if our input isn’t 90% of commitment and investment. We are a special group when we have our priorities right,” Tuchel told reporters. “If we’re committed, defend with courage, have the attitude right and hunger right, this is our foundation to show quality. We’re not the fancy group that comes with just quality and get away with just 90% commitment to the whole game. “It’s not always easy to have this hunger and commitment because we come from a ruthless schedule... It’s not about blaming the players, I understand why it was hard after the international break, but we have the quality.” Chelsea travel to Madrid in midweek before taking on Crystal Palace in the FA Cup semi-finals next weekend. Tuchel said he was not sure about the availability of captain Cesar Azpilicueta, who missed the Saints game due to COVID-19, and injured striker Romelu Lukaku. “Azpi had a positive COVID test since yesterday so I have no prediction about that,” Tuchel said. “We need a negative test.

Arteta said: “What happens now is we criticise ourselves a lot, get slapped again because we deserve it. “We were really poor again the first half and we need to lift ourselves up because we know that this road is taking us nowhere – especially where we want to be. We have everything to play for in the last eight games.” Goals from Leandro Trossard and Enock Mwepu put Brighton in control, with Martin Odegaard’s late strike sparking a fightback that was too little, too late. Arteta was withering in his assessment of his team and their failure to respond to defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday. He said: “The first half was really poor again. The reaction that we wanted to show and everything that we talked about we didn’t make it happen on the pitch. We were sloppy with the ball, we were second best again. We didn’t show any purpose or build any momentum in the game or play with speed or transform the game that Brighton proposed today. “It was not a problem of attitude, for me it was a problem of the approach and the courage that we showed and we didn’t have that purpose. I know that we didn’t have that intention to attack and step in and provoke the situation we want to provoke and we were looking at each other too many times instead of taking ownership and doing what we have to do. “You cannot play like that. You have to make yourself count and step in and today we didn’t do it.” Arteta also insisted his team cannot use injuries to Thomas Partey and Keiran Tierney as excuses for the collapse of their form. “With all of the team available we know how difficult the challenge is,” he added. “With those two big injuries it makes the situation more complicated. “We cannot look at that because we are going to be looking for excuses.

Criminally, they have even given Manchester United a glimmer of hope, despite Ralf Rangnick’s side picking up just one point from a possible six, including defeat to Everton earlier in the day. That result at Goodison should have been a boost to Arteta’s team before they even kicked off – knowing they could have effectively killed off one of their challengers. Instead, they produced another insipid display – hot on the heels of defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday – waiting until the closing stages to finally kick into life. Arteta said: “For me it was a problem of the approach and the courage that we showed to play and we didn’t have that purpose. I know that we didn’t have that intention to attack and step in and provoke the situation. “What happens now is we criticise ourselves a lot, get slapped again because we deserve it. We were really poor again the first half and have to lift ourselves up because we know that this road is taking us nowhere – especially where we want to be. We have everything to play for int eh last eight games.” This is now a severe examination of this young Arsenal team that had provided so much cause of optimism just a few short weeks ago. Against the odds, they looked on course for a place in the top four that no one predicted at the start of the season. But to blow that now would turn a largely encouraging campaign into a major disappointment. That is a measure of the job Arteta has done this term – but it is the hope that kills you. This felt like Arsenal of old. They are bottling it at a key stage of the campaign – and the damage caused by this run could be felt for a long time to come. How does Arteta lift his players, restore confidence and keep them in the battle for the Champions League places? Three of their next four games are against teams around them - Chelsea, United and West Ham. The clash with Southampton next week now becomes an absolute must win. It is up to Arteta to prove he is building something new – something different – and they can arrest a slide that threatens to completely derail their campaign. On this evidence, it is going to be a painful end to the season. They were utterly lifeless and clueless in a first half that saw Brighton take the lead through Leandro Trossard after 29 minutes. It was a superbly taken goal – but the manner in which Arsenal’s defenders were completely caught out by Enock Mwepu’s cutback was amateurish. Trossard simply checked his run to leave him completely free just inside the box and from there he picked his spot. Had Gabriel Martinelli’s header on the stroke of half time stood – rather than being ruled out for offside after a lengthy VAR check – it would have flattered Arsenal. While the home team improved after the break, they created virtually nothing for the majority of the half and went 2-0 down with similarly flimsy defending. Once again, they were caught out by a cutback – this time Moises Caicedo pulling the ball to the edge of the box where Mwepu advanced untracked and controlled a beautiful volley into the bottom corner. Anger filled the air inside the Emirates as the fans vented their fury at the limp display in front of their eyes. Perhaps more frustrating was the joy Arsenal eventually had when they woke from their slumber. It was too little, too late – even with six minutes of added time – but in that period of frenzied pressure saw them hit the bar twice, score and force Robert Sanchez into action more often than at any point earlier in the match. Martin Odegaard’s free kick hit the bar at the death and from the rebound Eddie Nketiah did likewise. With the ball still in play and Arsenal keeping the pressure on, Odegaard’s deflected effort from 30 yards dipped past Sanchez. The Emirates believed a comeback was on. Nketiah forced a flying save – then Gabriel came close. Brighton were against the ropes – but an equaliser did not come. Even salvaging a point could have made all the difference in terms of the narrative surrounding Arsenal at the moment. Instead defeat feels like this story is set for a miserable ending.

Mikel Arteta had to rejig the Arsenal starting lineup due to injuries and midfielder Granit Xhaka started at left back, a decision that gave Arsenal no control in midfield and no cohesion in attack in the first half.

Chelsea went up 1-0 in the eighth minute as Alonso ran on to a deft flick by Mount and blasted in his first league goal since the opening day of the campaign. Mount, Chelsea’s leading scorer in the league this season, equalled his tally of nine goals from the previous campaign with a superb shot from outside the box after Southampton’s shaky defence failed to deal with Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s cross. Southampton’s implosion continued as Werner made up for his earlier misses by beating Jan Bednarek for pace before rounding Fraser Forster and finishing into an empty net. Havertz then swept in Chelsea’s fourth after Werner hit the post again.

After a heavy defeat to Crystal Palace in their last match, the Gunners really needed a response to get their Champions League ambitions back on track heading into the final few weeks of the season. But it was another dreadful display from Mikel Arteta’s side, as Leandro Trossard and Enock Mwepu got on the scoresheet to put the Seagulls in control. Martin Odegaard’s deflected strike pulled one back late on, but there was to be no miraculous comeback. It leaves Arsenal level on points with Tottenham, who play Aston Villa later on Saturday. Spurs will have played a game more after that match, though Arsenal’s game in hand is away to Chelsea. Granit Xhaka was preferred at left-back for Arsenal over Nuno Tavares, leaving the Gunners without the Swiss international and Thomas Partey in midfield. Brighton started much the better of the two sides, with Arsenal showing the kind of sluggish performance in possession that saw them turned over by Palace. A brief moment of optimism in attack came when Gabriel headed Bukayo Saka’s cross into the side netting, but it was the Seagulls who took the lead shortly after. Mwepu got on the end of a long ball forward, played a great cut-back into the path of Trossard who was completely free in the box and took full advantage to fire past Aaron Ramsdale. The Gunners thought they had gone themselves level seconds before the break. A corner was swung in deep, Gabriel headed it back across the face of goal and Martinelli nodded home. However, after a four-minute VAR check, it was ruled out for offside. Martinelli was moved to left-back in the second-half as Mikel Arteta pushed for an equaliser. Saka blazed a shot over the bar when it fell to him in plenty of space on the edge of the box. There was little in the way of clear-cut chances for the Gunners though, and it got even worse for them midway through the half. It was a lovely move from Brighton, with Marc Cucurella and Moises Caicedo combining brilliantly to set up Mwepu, who swept a stunning finish into the bottom corner. Nicolas Pepe was denied by Lewis Dunk and Albert Sambi Lokonga fired a shot just wide from distance, before Odegaard and Eddie Nketiah both hit the bar in a matter of seconds in a chaotic passage of play. Odegaard gave his side hope of late drama, when his shot from miles out flicked off Danny Welbeck and looped beyond Robert Sanchez. The board then went up for six minutes of added-time as the Emirates crowd roared their side on. Sanchez produced a stunning save to deny Nketiah but Brighton held on, leaving Arsenal to ponder why it took them nearly 90 minutes to really pile the pressure on. ",positive,liverpool,0

Chelsea ripped through Southampton in an astonishing 6-0 victory in response to back-to-back defeats over the past week. Werner grabbed a brace as Thomas Tuchel’s side ran riot, with Marcos Alonso, Mason Mount and Kai Havertz also boosting their confidence ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League rescue mission at Real Madrid. After a thorough dressing down from Tuchel following Wednesday’s defeat to the Spanish side, the Blues squad arrived needing to put on a show - but even the German would not have been expecting this. The visitors were without captain Cesar Azpilicueta following a positive Covid test while Romelu Lukaku was absent from the squad after failing a late fitness test. Tuchel said this week that he knew things were going wrong against Madrid from the first minute, but there were no such worries here as Chelsea made a lightning start. Werner struck a post after a counter attack after just three minutes, firing an early warning shot Southampton’s way. With Azpilicueta out and Reece James named on the bench, Tuchel turned to Ruben Loftus-Cheek to fill in at right wing-back. The midfielder proved an instant hit in his new role and should have had an assist when crossing for Werner, who headed onto the bar from six yards out. Southampton refused to learn their lesson from the let off, allowing Loftus-Cheek to move forward a minute later and lift a cross into the unmarked Mount, who collected the ball on his chest and flicked it over his shoulder into the path of Alonso. The Spaniard finished low through the legs of Fraser Forster to settle any lingering nerves from a harrowing week. From there, Chelsea were utterly ruthless, taking every ounce of frustration from the last week out on Southampton - who couldn’t have been more welcoming. First they stood off to allow Mount to pick his spot and finish low from the edge of the box past Forster, before they began actively trying to boost Chelsea’s confidence. James Ward-Prowse appeared to notice that - having hit the post twice - Werner could do with a helping hand. The England international sent a shocking header over his own back four and into the space for Werner to attack, the forward rounding the Southampton goalkeeper and tucking away Chelsea’s third after just 21 minutes. The Blues had to wait an entire 10 minutes for number four. Mohamed Salisu folded under pressure from Kai Havertz and Werner on the edge of the box, allowing the latter to rob possession and drive forward. Werner struck the woodwork for a third time, with Havertz ready and waiting to tidy up the rebound and send thousands of home fans towards the bars in the concourse. Forster then had to be alert to stop Salisu heading one into his own net from a Chelsea corner on the brink of half time. Ralph Hasenhuttl ripped into his players at the break and made a second change of the afternoon, but Chelsea were quickly back on the warpath - Werner tapping in his second after Forster had parried an effort from the unmarked N’Golo Kante. The Southampton goalkeeper was left frothing at the mount once more minutes later when, after he made a double save from Christian Pulisic and Werner, the Southampton defence still allowed Mount to fire home a sixth. Real Madrid may not quite be quaking in their boots having watched this but Tuchel could hardly have asked for a better afternoon to ensure spirits are high as Chelsea look to pull off the remarkable on Tuesday.

The Blues were four ahead after just half an hour as Saints imploded with Marcos Alonso, Mason Mount, Timo Werner and Kai Havertz all getting on the scoresheet before the hosts had even turned up. Werner and Mount both grabbed a brace for themselves after the break as Chelsea continued to pile the misery on Southampton. Here is how Jack Rosser rated the Blues… Edouard Mendy 7 Made a superb second half save from Che Adams. Had very little else to do. Andreas Christensen 7 Largely untroubled by the Southampton forwards, composed on the ball. Thiago Silva 7 Could have spent the afternoon sunbathing for all the threat that Southampton posed. Antonio Rudiger 7 Recovered from a dodgy pass early on and easily contained any rare foray forward from the Saints. Ruben Loftus-Cheek 8 Played out of position at right wing-back but was a real threat in the first half. N’Golo Kante 8 Dominated midfield and looked to push forward whenever possible - got in a good position in the build-up to the fifth goal. Mateo Kovacic 7 Quicker to everything in midfield and was sharp in getting the ball up to the forward line. Marcos Alonso 8 Superb finish through the legs of Fraser Forster to get the show on the road early on. Mason Mount 9 A superb move to set up Alonso, a fantastic first goal and was quickest to the ball when getting his second. Fine performance. Kai Havertz 7 Bullied the Southampton defenders and was in the right place at the right time to take his goal. Timo Werner 8 Could probably have had more than his two having hit the woodwork three times. Southampton defenders couldn’t handle his pace. Substitutes Christian Pulisic 7 Lively in the build up to Mount’s second goal. Reece James 7 Slotted into the back three well after replacing Silva. Hakim Ziyech 6 Gave the Southampton defence something to think about but made little impact. ",positive,liverpool,0

Heading into Saturday, Ralph Hasenhuttl’s side looked like the worst kind of opposition for Thomas Tuchel. At their best, an organised team capable of frustrating the elite, it looked far from a favourable game. That, however, never proved to be the case. Marcos Alonso’s opener inside ten minutes came after Timo Werner had hit the woodwork twice and, from there, the floodgates opened. Mason Mount, not a popular figure amongst the Southampton support, scored a brilliant second with a controlled strike from just outside the box before Werner showed great composure on the counter to round the otherwise excellent Fraser Forster, which says so much about a team who lost by such a big margin. SPONSORED Kai Havertz tapped in after Werner had struck the post again to make it four before the interval. Less than five minutes into the second-half, the German striker - so often the butt of jokes - took his tally against Southampton up to five in total by scoring a second before Mount grabbed his brace. Chelsea’s Champions League tie with Real Madrid may be over. On this evidence, the Tuchel era very much isn’t. ",positive,liverpool,0

United’s top-four prospects suffered a serious setback as Anthony Gordon’s deflected first-half strike gave Everton a vital win in the fight to avoid relegation. After another damaging defeat, United stay four points off Tottenham and Arsenal in the race to finish fourth. Neville tweeted: “United a joke. Well done to Everton. Would have also been hard for Frank Lampard to hear Sean Dyche say what he said so well done to him. Some response.” Rio Ferdinand said on BT Sport: “Before the game, how bad Everton have been, I was still not sure whether United would get a result and that tells you a lot about where they are. “You do not know what you are going to get from them, either individually or as a team. That is not a good place to be.” United are closing in on the appointment of Erik ten Hag, with the Dutchman now expected to beat Mauricio Pochettino to the job. Asked whether talks about a new manager are distracting, United interim manager Ralf Rangnick said: “I don’t think this should be an excuse. “We are Manchester United.

Gordon goal - Premier League result, match stream and latest updates today","nthony Gordon boosted Everton’s hopes of Premier League survival as his first-half strike proved the difference in a scrappy affair against Manchester United. Gordon’s deflected effort before the half hour alleviated the pressure on Frank Lampard after a 3-2 midweek defeat at relegation rivals Burnley had left Everton just a solitary point above the drop zone. This was far from a vintage display from either side but a 1-0 win for the Toffees puts daylight between themselves and the bottom three as United’s top-four ambitions suffered another untimely dent.

Pickford was again called upon in time added on to deny Ronaldo on the half-volley after being teed up by Maguire before the referee’s whistle for full-time was greeted by an eruption of noise. SPONSORED Manchester United manager Ralf Rangnick, speaking to BT Sport, says: “If you don’t score a single goal in 95 minutes we have to be disappointed. We had a good start and should have created more chances out of that domination. Then we concede a deflected shot and lost a bit of our composure. “The second half we were trying to add creativity with substitutions but we didn’t always take the right decision. “We had to do something. We needed a goal and we decided to bring Mata and more verticality with Elanga. They were defending with their players in the last 35 minutes. We didn’t find the right player at the right moment. We didn’t have enough players in the box when we played crosses.” Are talks about a new manager distracting? “I don’t think this should be an excuse. We are Manchester United. We have lots of international players. There shouldn’t be an alibi. There will be a new manager next season. If this is announced now or in 10 days it shouldn’t have an impact.” Fabian Delph, Everton midfielder, speaking to BT Sport: “Coming off the back of the last game there was a lot of disappointment. Heads were down, as you’d expect. We came into it with a good game plan. We had to stick together at times, but we did that and got the three points. “We expected them to have chances. They’re a top team with top players. It was about sticking together and riding the storm, and we managed to do that. It’s a massive relief for the players, management and everyone associated with Everton.” On Frank Lampard’s message at half-time: “Just to stay in the game. We finally felt compact. We knew they were going to dominate the ball, so it was about staying compact, communicating and riding that wave.” On his own performance and fitness: “It was good for me to get out there. I’m always wanting to help the lads. It was good to do that today, but I don’t think I’ll train for a week!” On the relegation scrap: “It’s a massive fight. One game at a time. We’re not going to get carried away. The next game is about getting points on the table, that’s our main focus and to stay up.” Everton’s goalscorer Anthony Gordon speaking to BT Sport: “You can see by the results we get here. We definitely feed off the fans and are a better team with them. They are a top team with top players at the front end of the pitch so we did really well to keep a clean sheet. “The gaffer always says you make your own luck by working hard and winning the ball back. I made my own luck with a bit of hard work. “I can only speak for myself but I’m really sore and have had a few kicks.” This is what it means to Everton...

The Gunners trimmed their squad significantly back in the January, allowing five players to leave, as they were able to focus solely on the Premier League. Next season, however, Arsenal should be back in European competition as they look set to qualify for either the Champions League or Europa League. And asked if he expected a busy summer, Arteta said: “I am expecting so, yes. “I think both competitions [the Champions League and Europa League] require a much larger squad because the amount of games you play is much bigger in both, so I don’t think [which you qualify for] makes a lot of difference or changes a lot. “If you can financially afford it and we don’t have to do the turnaround in the squad that we’ve had to do, if you ask me what I want it’s 22 outfield players and three goalkeepers. “You have to come a long way in the aspects that you see on the pitch, it’s a lot of things that have to be put in place, and that takes time.” Arsenal remain in the driving seat to qualify for the Champions League this season. They are currently fifth in the Premier League, but are level on points with Tottenham above them and have a game in hand.

A Karim Benzema hat-trick at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night all but ended Chelsea's hopes of defending their Champions League crown and sparked a night of comfort eating for Tuchel as he relived the nightmare over and over again. Tuchel hauled his players in for a frank meeting on Thursday to try and shake them out of their slump having grown increasingly frustrated at the performance. “I watched the match again and I got angry at home in the night, in the middle of the night, and the next morning I watched it again and got angry again,” said the German. Tuchel managed to keep a lid on his anger and did not take it out on anything around the house, but had to watch the game at double speed to get it over with quickly, such was his frustration. It is not an experience he will want to repeat after Saturday's trip to Southampton or next week's second leg in Madrid. “At home, I was not that angry... the dog was safe, the dog is always safe,” said Tuchel. “You sit there in the middle of the night and the amount of chocolate I needed was immense to go through the match again and compensate. “It is not nice, you start writing and writing and writing and you realise that you are writing more and more, more minutes with a certain way of explaining things so that you don't forget it. “At some point you press the button to watch it in double speed, just so it passes quicker and then you know you're not in a good place. “At some point you have to stop and take a walk into the kitchen or the lounge and come back and press to calm down. It was not nice to watch.” Tuchel added: ""It is good to do it because it makes you process it and understand clearer what the message should be, not to be general and be more specific and we found some stuff and from there we go. ""I got some sleep late but it is not the first bad match we have analysed and sometimes it is necessary that you dig into that because otherwise it would not have been possible to sleep because of the emotion. ""It helps to watch it even if you don't like it. Then you come and watch with the staff, share your thoughts and impressions. Do a meeting and then training which is the best to do and then try to get back the sleep you missed the next afternoon."" Having caught up on his kip, Tuchel is now hoping the late night will pay off with a response on the south coast on Saturday. ""Somehow after international break we had the feeling like we play with 80, 90 percent and we hope to get away with it and it is not like this,"" said Tuchel.

The fact that Benzema managed something similar against Liverpool’s Loris Karius in the 2018 Champions League final speaks to a player capable of creating and pouncing on opportunities but Mendy has not always been entirely commanding of late. Some lax passing almost allowed Ivan Toney to score before Brentford thrashed Chelsea 4-1 at Stamford Bridge only days before the Madrid game, while Tuchel has previously admitted Mendy “lost confidence” after a poor game during a loss at West Ham. Clearly, it would be foolish to write off a player to have won both the Champions League and the Africa Cup of Nations, as well as a number of individual awards, over the past year and Tuchel has offered some perspective. ‘He was never fully free of mistakes, also not last season, but we helped him,’ said Tuchel. ‘It’s bad timing to do a mistake like this in a quarter-final, such a big occasion like this, one of the worst moments. I hope it doesn’t affect his self-confidence too much, because accepting mistakes is also what goalkeeping is about, living with mistakes, and going back and helping your team. Now he can prove he is a true champion.’ ",negative,liverpool,1

The Premier League’s top scorer has only 16 months left on his contract and talks look to have hit an impasse in recent months. Jurgen Klopp has repeatedly claimed there was no update on how talks were progressing over a potential extension for the 29-year-old amid reports linking the player with a move away. Equally, there have been suggestions the Egyptian forward is close to extending his stay at Anfield for a number of years but, for as long as nothing is signed, the worry that a player to have propelled Liverpool back to the top of English football could leave will only increase. In 241 games for the club since moving from AS Roma in 2017, Salah has scored 153 goals and remains one of the game’s leading marksmen. But ahead of Sunday’s clash with rivals Manchester City which could go a long way to deciding this season’s champions, Salah sought to play down the potential distraction. Salah told Sky Sports News: ""There are many things that people don’t know about it - I can’t be selfish and talk about my situation (because) we are in the most important situation that is coming for the team. ""I’ve said many times what I want but I can’t really go deep into the contract now because it is a sensitive situation. ""I can’t go in the news and talk about the contract now, I am just focused on the team. That is the most important thing for me, (being) focused to win trophies and I’m just giving everything for the club."" Additional reporting from PA ",positive,liverpool,2

The two will meet on Sunday in what is surely one of the biggest Premier League games in history. City’s lead has been cut down to just one point and a win for either side would put one hand on the title at this stage of the campaign. Throughout the respective spells of both Guardiola and Klopp in England, their sides have redefined what it takes to win a title. City have broken the 100 point barrier and the 2018-19 season saw Liverpool finish on 97 points, only to end up second. Klopp’s own Premier League victory saw his team amass 99 points and the German is the manager to have beaten Guardiola the most over the course of his career, with 9 wins in 22 matches. The City chief managed Barcelona during a time in which battles with Jose Mourinho’s Real Madrid were legendary, though looks upon this challenge as even greater. Speaking ahead of their game at the Etihad Stadium, Guardiola said: ""I admire what they do, how good they are. I enjoy this challenge.

Currently, United sit three points behind Tottenham in fourth and have only won three of their last six games. Still and, even with the seemingly imminent appointment of Ajax boss Erik Ten Hag, Rangnick has hinted he will hold talks with decision-makers at the club in the coming weeks, although his full focus is on finishing the season in charge. ""What I know about all the managers the club has spoken to so far, they are top managers, top coaches, and if this includes Erik ten Hag it is also true of him,” he said. ""That’s all I can say about that at this stage. For me it’s about preparing for tomorrow’s game."" ""As you know I have agreed a contract as an advisor.

Three defeats in a row has seen Gerrard suggest many in his squad are playing for their futures as the former England captain gears up for his first full season in charge of a Premier League club. Speaking ahead of the game, Gerrard called on his players to draw on some of Spurs’ inconistent displays, believing Conte to have been “extremely frustrated” as a result. “Spurs are in great form and they’ve got a top-class manager,” he said. “You have to remember that over the course of the season, Spurs aren’t unbeatable. “It wasn’t so long ago that the manager was extremely frustrated because they had inconsistencies.

City’s lead has been cut down to only one point and any victor on Sunday would surely be considered as favourites to win the title. While the rivalry arguably lacks some of the needle the battles Manchester United and Arsenal had at the turn of the millennium, the overall quality of both City and Liverpool has rarely been matched by other English sides. Guardiola and Klopp, however, do not appear to have the kind of fiery relationship Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger - or Jose Mourinho and Rafa Benitez - were embroiled in with the Liverpool boss hailing his City counterpart as “the best coach in the world.” Speaking at his press conference, Guardiola distanced himself from such comments but moved to praise Klopp in return. “I didn’t become a manager to be the best. I’m not. Thank you so much, but I’m not. I’d like to say I’m the best, but I’m not. “I’d say incredible things about my team. My team are the best. I like to admit my players are exceptional. ""Jurgen makes world football a better place to live. He’s a huge competitor. He’s a good guy and I don’t have any problems with him.” Guardiola did not want to comment on the publication of further accusations about the club’s final affairs this week. He said: ""I cannot control the people from where it comes.

The European champions were hammered 4-1 by London rivals Brentford last weekend before Madrid all but ended their hopes of defending their Champions League crown with a 3-1 win at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. Tuchel has been dumbfounded by the defensive displays which have seen them ship seven goals in two games, with the Blues usually so robust at the back under the German. Ahead of Saturday's visit to Southampton, the former Paris Saint-Germain boss hauled his players in for a meeting at their Cobham training ground on Thursday to vent his frustrations. “It was not a discussion meeting yesterday… It was more [one where] I gave my point of view,” said Tuchel. “This is sometimes necessary. We take the players' view very seriously and often into account but over the last two games we thought it is necessary to give our point of view. “Behind closed doors, in an atmosphere where everybody can take criticism. I feel involved in a development like this. We don’t point fingers and look for people that are guilty. We are in this together. We needed to point out some points in our game where we are unhappy and could have defended better."" Asked about the sudden defensive frailties, Tuchel said: “It is very not like us to defend like this and concede so many goals. “That’s why we didn’t see it coming because it was not the case before national break. These two matches within five days are very untypical and not easy to deal with because it does not fit to a pattern. “We constantly try to figure out how we can improve.

There are still eight matches to play in this league season, almost a quarter of the campaign, a period in which some of the most iconic Premier League title races have produced their most dramatic twists and turns. But this feels different, the latest instalment of a rivalry that has raised the bar, between two teams so good they really ought to be peerless. Instead, they have each other. For Liverpool in particular, defeat would surely be terminal, the gap widening to four points and meaning Manchester City would have to slip up twice even if Jurgen Klopp’s side are flawless. City, though, will be equally wary of ceding ground to a team who have been just that since mid-January, winning ten on the bounce in the league. The level of excellence required just to keep pace in this race, let alone win it, has brought back memories of three years ago, when 98 points played 97 and Liverpool closed out the season with nine straight wins but were still pipped by City, who racked up 14. Statistically the highest-quality title race in top-flight history might have lacked some of the slip-ups and swings that have punctuated its greatest, but it was also missing this kind of business end head-to-head, the fixture computer conspiring to throw up their league second meeting as early as the third day of the New Year. Both head to the Etihad in prime form, big guns firing and - with the exception of Ruben Dias’ continued absence - full-strength teams. That this could yet prove the first of a season-defining trilogy is lost on no one either, as talk of trebles and quadruples abounds. The FA Cup semi-final between Manchester United and Arsenal in 1999 is often credited with having indirectly determined the Premier League and European champions as well, but Liverpool and City might yet have one another’s fate in their hands on all fronts, all the way to the line. They meet again at Wembley in the FA Cup next weekend and, after each taking significant strides towards the Champions League semi-finals in midweek, remain on course for a showdown in Paris at the end of it all. But for now, all that matters is Sunday: whichever name is on top of the Premier League table by the end of the weekend will likely be the same one on the Premier League trophy by the end of May.

Nuno has started just two games since the turn of the year and on both occasions has not made it past 45 minutes of action. The 22-year-old, however, impressed earlier on in the season and Arteta has encouraged him to learn from this tough spell now. Nuno could get plenty of game time before the campaign ends as fellow left-back Kieran Tierney will be out for the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery. “Obviously I speak with the players and I spoke with Nuno because I care a lot how they feel and we are here to help them, and make their careers better,” said Arteta. “That was a decision that hurt him, obviously, but he understands that it was for the benefit of the team, that I believe it was for the benefit of the team, and he respects that. “Now he needs to react on that situation, because it is a great opportunity to learn a lot in that period in your career.” Tierney’s surgery on Thursday evening was a success, but he is still not expected to return before the end of the club season. He could, however, be back for Scotland’s World Cup qualifying play-off semi-final against Ukraine in June. “I don’t know yet, he just had a surgery yesterday,” said Arteta. “So it is very early to understand how everything is going to develop, he’s going to be out for the period that we estimate but to know what condition he will be after that period, I think it’s too soon to to be able to say something. “I think the player has to do the maximum that he can to be in the best possible condition as quick as possible. “I’m sure Kieran will do that and once he’s there, let’s see if he’s able to compete and with what kind of risk or not, but I’m sure he will do that. “Our responsibility is to look after them when we have them here. “Once they go to a national team in these cases it is the job and responsibility of Steve Clarke to decide a team that he believes is the best to win games and we have to try to have good communications with national teams, which we have, but these things happen.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Conte, whose side visit Aston Villa on Saturday, has a reputation as a taskmaster, demanding his players “suffer” during his gruelling training sessions. The head coach has sought to change various aspects of his squad’s lives, including what they eat and their sleeping patterns, and at the start of his tenure in November he made headlines by reportedly banning ketchup and fatty foods from the players’ canteen. His methods have worked, with an improving Spurs back in the top four after five wins from their last six. “I’ve tried to bring my experience as a player to my players,” Conte told Standard Sport. “When I was a player, I made many mistakes, so I try to give the right advice to my players, like a big brother, because I want the best for them. “When you get older, you’re more experienced and you start to understand situations that in the past you thought weren’t useful. In my experience, only after 30 years old I understood the importance of food. SPONSORED “I understood that to eat well was good for injuries, to recover well. And to sleep eight hours was important. When you become older, you can add experience in your talent, your quality, your professionalism.” One player Conte has not had to advise on his lifestyle is Harry Kane, who has employed his own chef since 2017 and is renowned for his professionalism. Conte says Kane is “the right age” to become one of the best strikers in history and believes his approach will ensure he keeps getting better, like Karim Benzema, 34, and Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo, 37. “We’re talking about a player [Kane] who has already shown to be a top-class striker,” Conte said. “In the past he scored fantastic goals. He was younger, but despite this he scored in a fantastic way in every season. “When you grow older, you gain experience and understand your body much better, you improve your mentality. Players like them [Benzema and Ronaldo] have great professionalism. Ronaldo — why has he arrived at his age with this mentality and type of performance? Because he takes care of himself, and if you take care in training sessions, about your food, you become more complete. “And we’re talking about a player [in Harry] who in every training session wants to push himself, wants to improve himself. For him, it will be very easy to find the right way to continue to develop and find the best of him, absolutely. “Harry also has the right age to show that he can be one of the best [not only] in the world, but in history. I think he’s already in history because he scored a lot of goals for the club and scored a lot of goals for the national team. He’s the captain. He has the right age to consolidate and be one of the best in the world.” Conte is set to welcome back wing-backs Sergio Reguilon and Ryan Sessegnon, but Oliver Skipp remains sidelined after an injury setback. Spurs could go in to the match outside the top four, with Arsenal hosting Brighton at 3pm, but should move back into the Champions League places with a win, after a seven-goal swing over their rivals last weekend.

The Hammers battled to a 1-1 draw in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final last night after having left-back Aaron Cresswell controversially sent off just before half-time. David Moyes was furious with referee Felix Zwayer for showing Cresswell a soft red card for the slightest of arm-pulls on Moussa Dembele. West Ham, fuelled by a sense of injustice, took the lead through Jarrod Bowen before on-loan Tottenham midfielder Tanguy Ndombele equalised for the visitors. But once Moyes’s anger fades, he will look back on a resilient display that leaves West Ham in a good position ahead of the second leg next week. West Ham can expect a hostile atmosphere in the 60,000-capacity Parc Olympique Lyonnais, but Dawson insists they will enjoy it. “We all know what it will be like,” said the defender. “We’ll be ready for that. Hopefully, we can get the right result. “Will we relish it? Yeah, of course. It will be a difficult game for us. We’ll be professional but be ready for it. We know a bit more about them now.” Moyes refused to be drawn on the controversial decision to send off Cresswell, but Bowen branded it “cheap”. Dawson added: “[It was] a big call from the referee, but the lads showed great courage and togetherness to stay in the game and keep fighting. “[The referee] made his decision very quickly, but there’s not much we can do as players. We put in a great shift. It was a setback, but the lads worked ever so hard. It was difficult, but the fight was there. It was good to see from the lads.” Dawson epitomised the defensive resilience displayed by West Ham in the second half, as they refused to roll over on a night that showed the team unity and spirit manager Moyes has instilled in his players. They also showed at the other end that they can hurt Lyon, who are ninth in Ligue 1 but reached the Champions League semi- finals two years ago. Moyes said he was disappointed by the overall performance of his side, which is another sign of West Ham’s progress under him. But he could take pride from his players refusing to collapse after their setback. “We were really resilient in the second half,” he said. “We came in at the break knowing with 10 men it was a difficult job. “We stuck at it and had one or two opportunities ourselves. Overall, it was more of a backs-to-the-wall performance in the second half, but we are still in with a good shout. “We didn’t play well and we can only play much better next week.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Hoos, speaking exclusively to Standard Sport, has dismissed talk that Warburton is set to face the sack after four straight defeats dented Rangers' push for the top six - and issued a rallying cry to players ahead of the final six games. Warburton's contract is up at the end of the season and Hoos conceded that club and manager could still part ways at the end of the campaign, but added that there is every chance the former Brentford boss could earn a new deal - and a big finish to the season may take the issue out of QPR's hands. “Mark came out after someone asked directly does his contract end [this summer],” Hoos tell Standard Sport. “It's not quite that simple. There are three avenues that we could go down. ""One which would be the contract ends this summer and we shake hands and say, ‘Let's everybody just take a step back and take a deep breath and figure out where we're going to go’. SPONSORED ""Second the contract ends, and we renegotiate another contract, and we continue on, or he hits certain trigger points in the contract, in which case is automatically renewed."" Hoos is reluctant to give specifics on what would trigger that clause, but adds: “[If it is triggered] we will have had a very good end to the season.” Ahead of last month's international break, QPR had beaten Luton to move fourth in the table. However, Warburton's side have lost four on the bounce since then and now sit five points outside of the play-offs with six games to go. Tempers have been raised among a disappointed fan base - something Hoos understands - but there is a clear message that the season is far from over just yet. “The fans have always been behind us,” says Hoos. “One thing I never forget [about football], is that it is about venting. The whole thing is about venting. “When it goes well it is fantastic and it goes great, but when it does not you just want to get it out. I do it just as much as the next man, I just can't do it publicly - my wife has to bear the brunt of that. “I am in the same boat, so is Mark Warburton and Les [Ferdinand]. There is a level of frustration. I mean everybody needs to remember this team is good. Players, you guys are good. Just reconnect with that, don't overthink it, just go out and do what comes naturally.” Whether QPR make the play-offs or not, there can be heart taken from the fact they are no longer betting the house on pushes like these and will be well placed to go again this season. However, few inside the club like to see it that way. “You can say look how far we have come,” Hoos says. “I know how far we have come but it is about making sure we continue on that journey.” In continuing that journey, Hoos and those around him at senior level must find a way to compete with those clubs - such as Fulham, Norwich and Watford - who happily bounce between the Premier League and Championship aided by the parachute payments each season. Parachute payments are a double benefit now, a soft landing and a boost. FA figures released last month revealed that their London rivals had spent more than £10million on agents fees between February 2021 and the end of the January transfer window - almost a quarter of all the cash spent on such fees in the entire Championship and more than 10 times what QPR spent. “It is tough,” says Hoos. “It is one of the reasons why the Football League are saying - from a competitive standpoint - we have to do something about parachute payments. “Clubs have said all along that they are a problem and they hurt. They are supposed to be a soft landing. It's a double benefit now, they get a soft landing and a boost. “I don't want it to sound like we've hit a headwind and now we're moaning, this isn't sour grapes. “The Premier League has to play ball on this if we're going to get traction, and they're clearly not. It is in their interest to keep kicking the can down the road. Football is incapable of changing unless the government comes in, the reality is that it is incapable of governing itself.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Cameras caught Dembele winking towards a team-mate moments after Aaron Cresswell was shown a soft red card for the slightest of arm-pulls on him. West Ham battled to a 1-1 draw with 10 men to leave their Europa League quarter-final finely poised ahead of the return leg in France next week. But Moyes was fuming with German referee Felix Zwayer. And the West Ham manager has warned Dembele that football can come back to bite you. Speaking on Friday morning, Moyes said: “I think in the end football comes around. It is a strange thing football. It comes around and you have got to be careful.” Moyes again refused to be drawn on the decision to send off Cresswell or on the performance of referee Zwayer. “I said last night that I do not really want to talk about referees or decisions,” he said. Former West Ham striker Carlton Cole was furious with the red card. At the London Stadium as a pundit for BT Sport, Cole said: “That is not enough contact to go down in that fashion, if I was to go down in that fashion, they would call me a diver. “When you look at his face, he winks when the camera goes onto him. He is getting the opportunity to do that and he is going to take it.” ",positive,liverpool,0
58,https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/afc-wimbledon-mk-dons-b993271.html,AFC Wimbledon face MK Dons with original ‘phoenix club’ in need of a miracle to beat relegation,"or some AFC Wimbledon fans, the prospect of facing MK Dons at Plough Lane on Saturday is the stuff of nightmares. Their team is in free-fall as they prepare to face their most bitter rivals without a win in 22 matches in League One, 22nd in the table and spiralling towards relegation. Wimbledon are four points from safety with just five matches to play. The original ‘phoenix’ club needs another miracle to avoid a return to League Two. MK Dons, on the other hand, arrive at Plough Lane in rude health and sit second, unbeaten in their last 18 matches and chasing automatic promotion. Should they hammer a nail in Wimbledon’s coffin, then it would be a painful experience. Wimbledon’s predicament is the result of a disastrous run since early December. The mood around the club at the start of the season was high, mainly because they were finally back at their spiritual home and there was optimism around then-head coach Mark Robinson. The Wimbledon fan, who originally joined the Dons in 2004, had been handed the job permanently last February and was in charge of a team playing attractive football and filled with players he had worked with previously in the academy. Wimbledon were unbeaten in five games before a Covid-enforced three-week break in December disrupted their rhythm — and it has been all downhill since then. A disastrous run of 12 defeats and nine draws from 21 matches has left them in a relegation dogfight. The sale of star striker Ollie Palmer in January did not help. Wrexham paid a club-record £300,000 for the 30-year-old and significantly increased his salary. Wimbledon were reluctant to sell, but that level of fee is not to be sniffed at in League One, not least when you have a £4.6million bridging loan for a £32m stadium to refinance in April. The Dons have managed just 11 goals in 16 games since his departure. Confidence has been an issue, particularly when it has come to securing results from winning positions, and some of that could be put down to the lack of experience in the squad. The problems ultimately cost Robinson his job when he was sacked on March 28. Just five days earlier, he had been publicly backed by the club, which showed reluctance to part ways with him. Robinson remains a huge supporter and even went to Tuesday’s 1-1 draw with Charlton as a fan. Mark Bowen, the former Reading manager and long-time assistant to Mark Hughes, has since taken over, but there is a feeling it has all come too late to save them. Their decline points to wider questions about whether more football expertise is needed at a club that has been fan-owned since its rebirth in 2002. No one can argue with the way Wimbledon fans have saved their club and crowd-funded a move back to Plough Lane. Their bond schemes, the latest of which raised £3.4m, are the envy of many and executives at Championship clubs have asked how they have pulled it off. The new stadium boasts weekly attendances of around 7,500, while games can draw 600 people for hospitality, which should help Wimbledon make an operating profit this season. That success, coupled with the club’s work in the community, is undeniable, but the implementation of a technical director could be the missing link to on-field success. Mark Bowen Others argue, too, that outside investment is needed, but such an idea is a non-starter for many fans old enough to remember the original Wimbledon being controversially relocated to Milton Keynes. Local businessman Nick Robinson invested in the club in 2020, but he is a lifelong fan. There is also the argument about what constitutes success for Wimbledon. For some fans, success is simply the fact they have a team to watch every week. Others, though, have ambitions about moving up the divisions. Whatever the outcome this season, the summer will be key. There will be the uncertainty that comes with relegation should they go down. There will be questions over Bowen, the squad and the vacant position of chief executive, previously held by Joe Palmer before he stepped down in February, that needs to be filled. Palmer played a key role in getting Wimbledon back to Plough Lane and his successor must look to drive the club forward following a period of reflection on the events of this season.

Williamson has been captaining the side since September in the absence of the injured Steph Houghton, but was this week handed the armband for the Women’s Euros by head coach Sarina Wiegman. “I’m absolutely buzzing for her,” Wubben-Moy told Standard Sport. “Not just as a teammate but as an individual, I’ve seen her journey through thick and thin, hard and good times, and she deserves this moment. “I can’t wait to see how she’ll grow in this role. I guess she’s been leading since even before she got the armband and also learning.” Williamson, who will miss tonight’s World Cup qualifier against North Macedonia as she follows concussion protocols, is tasked with leading a side rated among the favourites to a first major tournament success. England were knocked out in the semi-finals of the last Euros in 2017, as well as the last two World Cups, and will be desperate to play a part in the final at Wembley on July 31, tickets for which sold out in less than 24 hours after going on sale last month. However, Wubben-Moy insists that the 25-year-old has the character to carry that burden ahead of what is expected to be a landmark summer. “Pressure is privilege,” she said. “She’s worked for this moment and she’ll cherish that pressure I’m sure, use it to the better. There’s no greater honour than leading your country out as a captain and I’m almost sure she’ll cherish it.” Wubben-Moy is two years Williamson’s junior and like her new captain came through the Arsenal academy. Speaking as part of Nationwide and England Football’s Where Greatness Is Made campaign, which is celebrating some of England’s most significant female captains by erecting plaques in their hometowns, the centre-back paid tribute to the influence her new national team skipper has already had on her career. “On my [Arsenal] debut at 16, just before kick-off she looked at me and said: ‘Enjoy this moment, remember it, cherish it and just be present in this moment because there’ll be no other moment like it’. “I’ll never forget that, when she passed on that nugget of wisdom and I’d like to think I can do that for younger players coming through, making debuts for Arsenal and for England.” Wubben-Moy withdrew from the England squad for February’s Arnold Clark Cup matches against Spain, Germany and Canada through injury and after being called-up by Wiegman again this month has also been forced to pull out of the trip to North Macedonia because of a thigh problem. The timing is frustrating for a player looking to cement her place at the home Euros, but the 23-year-old believes the experience of playing in the Champions League for Arsenal this season will be invaluable when the continent’s best teams arrive on these shores in July. “It’s always good to be tested at the top level,” she added. “Our league [WSL] is extremely competitive and all but one of our players is competing in our league but to then have that extra challenge of Champions League football is great for me and the other players. We can test and benchmark ourselves against some of the best players in Europe. “That Wolfsburg team last week was full of German international players and the Germans could be possible opposition in the Euros. You’ve go to beat the best to be the best so we’ll be relishing that competition.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Despite boasting a numerical advantage for the entirety of the second-half following Aaron Cresswell’s controversial red card, Lyon fell a goal behind after some lax defending allowed Jarrod Bowen’s shot to deflect off of Jerome Boateng and over a scrambling Lopes. Tottenham loanee Tanguy Ndombele did manage to level the scores but, for a team who were playing in the latter stages of the Champions League relatively recently, not being able to inflict further damage was undoubtedly disappointing. Domestically, Lyon’s home form has tailed off in recent weeks. While Peter Bosz’s side have won 8 of their 15 games at the Groupama Stadium, they have conceded seven times in their last three fixtures. Certainly a team West Ham can exploit, no one in the top half of Ligue 1 have conceded more often at home this season. Speaking after the game, goalkeeper Lopes said: “There are regrets about the way the game went. “We went in at 0-0 at half-time. They got that red, but it’s a fight when you come to England and we had to stay alert. But we started the second half badly, we conceded a goal that I think was a bit unprofessional. We reacted well afterwards, even if I think we could have come away with a more positive result.” ",negative,liverpool,0

Kane has been in sensational form since Conte joined the club at the start of November, and has directly contributed to seven goals in his last five appearances as Spurs have climbed into the top four. Conte was at Stamford Bridge to witness Karim Benzema’s sublime hat-trick against the Italian’s former club Chelsea on Wednesday and was asked where he ranked Kane, 28, among the world’s best centre-forwards. ""He deserves an important position in the world of football,"" Conte said. ""I think Harry also he has the right age to show that he can be one of the best, best in the world but especially in history, no? I think he’s already in the history because he scored a lot of goals for the club and scored a lot of goals for the national team. He’s the captain. ""He has the right age to consolidate and be one of the best in the world. His role, he’s a number nine but at the same time he can be a number 10 because of his quality. He’s very good to make assists and to put the ball where he wants. We try also to exploit this aspect and give the ball to him. ""About our team, I’m trying to improve not his quality but to be more effective, to be in the box and a striker. ""I repeat we’re talking about a fantastic player, so it’s very difficult to improve him but we’re trying to work, to push him to have the top ambition to become the best striker."" Conte welcomed Sergio Reguilon and Ryan Sessegnon back to training on Thursday, with the pair in line to return to the squad against Aston Villa on Saturday. Matt Doherty deputised at left wing-back in Sunday’s 5-1 win over Newcastle, finishing with a goal and assist, and Conte said the Republic of Ireland international is an ""example"" to the rest of his squad. ""Matthew is the typical player that is showing good improvement,"" Conte said ahead of the trip to Villa Park. ""At the start he didn’t play a lot with me because at that moment I think he didn’t deserve to play. ""But then he worked really hard. He’s a really good guy. In every training session, you see the desire, the will to improve himself, the tactical and technical aspect. He’s got a great mentality. He’s strong. ""Many times when players don’t play a lot, they go down mentally. But he’s shown me to be strong, to stay there. He showed me, ‘I can do what you want, I am going to improve and when I am ready I want to play’. He showed me not with talking but with his attitude and his behaviour and for this reason he is playing, he is deserving to play and he is playing very well. He has great confidence and I am very happy for him, because this is a big example for the other players. I want to win and I don’t care if I play one player or another player, I decide the player when I see that this player gives me great attitude."" Spurs’ loanee Giovani Lo Celso was named man of the match as Villarreal beat Bayern Munich 1-0 in their Champions League quarter-final first leg on Wednesday night. Conte revealed he was happy for the Argentine midfielder but said the club made the right decision to allow him to leave in January, and suggested he was not suited to the Premier League. ""I’m really happy for his great performance,"" Conte said. ""He needed to play with regularity, with continuity. For this reason he went to Spain in a league he knows very well because he played very well and Tottenham bought him when he played in that league. ""To go back there and show he’s in good form is good for everybody, especially because Tottenham paid a lot of money for him. I am very happy because he is playing every game, he’s showing he’s a good player but I never said he’s not a good player. ""I said this league is a very difficult league because it is not enough to have great quality and it’s important to play with great intensity and strength. But now he is playing with regularity and I am very happy for him, also Gil, they are playing very well in Spain. Also the club did the right choice, yes."" ",positive,liverpool,0
63,https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-antonio-conte-arsenal-b992339.html,Arsenal beware... How Tottenham finally learned to play the Antonio Conte way after Newcastle drubbing,"ntonio Conte was not beyond criticism during Tottenham’s wildly inconsistent spell at the start of the year, but the Italian is consistently proving that, unsurprisingly, he knows exactly what he is doing. Conte was rewarded for sticking to his guns as Spurs thrashed Newcastle 5-1 yesterday to move into the top four with a third straight win, heaping the pressure on rivals Arsenal. Without injured left wing-backs Ryan Sessegnon and Sergio Reguilon, Conte moved Matt Doherty over from the right and brought in Emerson Royal in a change which threatened to blunt both Spurs’ flanks. After 40 minutes of yesterday’s game, Conte appeared to have made a costly mis-step, particularly as in-form Steven Bergwijn or Lucas Moura might have offered his side a more exciting option at wing-back or the chance to play with another forward from the off. Spurs trailed to Fabian Schar’s opportunistic free-kick six minutes before the interval in a game which followed familiar patterns for Conte’s side, who looked short of rhythm after the international break, were struggling to break down stubborn opponents and had conceded a careless set-piece goal. But this Spurs side is improving with every game and within four minutes of Schar’s strike, Ben Davies glanced home Heung-min Son’s cross to ensure the sides went in level at the interval. What followed was a devastating attacking display which might be the best 45 minutes of football Spurs have produced since Amsterdam in 2019. Most pleasing for Conte, aside from the character his players showed, were the contributions of Doherty and Emerson, who justified their selections by scoring, with the wing-backs combining for the Brazilian’s first for the club which made it 4-1. Conte has come to rely on a small group of players — Emerson for Reguilon was the first change to his XI in four matches — but yesterday was evidence Spurs can lose key men but remain a functioning team. Tottenham are finally playing the Antonio Conte way after their 5-1 drubbing of Newcastle Conte has built a career on drilling his players to the letter, ensuring each one of them knows what to do, and yesterday’s second half showed the penny has dropped and that the head coach can rotate for the run-in but maintain a competitive side. That subs Moura and Bergwijn combined for Spurs’ fifth, the Netherlands international following up his three goals for his country last week with a cool finish, added to the sense that Conte’s system has finally clicked. “Every player knows very well what happens during the game and what they have to do,” Conte said. Conte is also blessed with outstanding players and Spurs’ riotous second half was inspired by Harry Kane, who assisted Doherty’s goal and was involved in the outstanding team move, finished by Son, which put the hosts two goals clear. “When the game finished, I went into the pitch to thank my players and I said to Harry, ‘I am only disappointed for one thing, that you didn’t score, because you played a massive game’,” Conte said. Conte will have been particularly pleased by the displays of Emerson Royal and Matt Doherty “It is very difficult to describe this player. We are talking about a world-class striker. He is a great worker, a hard worker.” Arsenal can leapfrog their rivals back into fourth place if they avoid defeat at Crystal Palace tonight, but they will be sitting far less comfortably after yesterday’s result. Mikel Arteta’s side will know there is even less room for error now Spurs are finally playing the Conte way. ",positive,liverpool,0

Despite boasting a numerical advantage for the entirety of the second-half following Aaron Cresswell’s controversial red card, Lyon fell a goal behind after some lax defending allowed Jarrod Bowen’s shot to deflect off of Jerome Boateng and over a scrambling Lopes. You can read Lopes’ full comments here. Michail Antonio has never felt better in a West Ham shirt. The forward is playing with a freedom he has rarely enjoyed since arriving in 2015 from Nottingham Forest. Gone is the pressure of a relegation battle but, most importantly, he no longer fears feeling a tweak in his hamstring. Tonight’s historic Europa League quarter-final against Lyon is a huge moment for West Ham, but for their No9 it is also a significant milestone. When the 32-year-old walks out at the London Stadium, it will be his 38th appearance of the season, matching his highest-ever tally in one season for West Ham, with almost two months of the campaign still to run. Hamstring injuries and muscle problems have dogged his time at the club, but now Antonio finally has confidence in his body to compete at the highest level, despite the gruelling schedule brought about by European and international commitments. “It has been amazing,” Antonio tells Standard Sport. “I’ve loved every minute of it. Setbacks are hard to take, especially when you are trying your hardest and feel like you are doing all the right stuff. This season, throwing in even international games, with no real breaks, my body has managed to stay together.” You can read Antonio’s full interview here.

The midfielder, who suffered a cardiac arrest on the pitch playing for Denmark at Euro 2020 last year, has excelled since joining Brentford on a free transfer in January. Eriksen scored his first goal for the Bees last Saturday in the 4-1 victory at Chelsea and he will be hoping to build on that when they face West Ham on Sunday. The 30-year-old signed only a six-month contract with Brentford, who are desperate to keep him beyond this summer, but he is happy in west London.

The first warning sign for the hosts, watched on Wednesday night by takeover hopeful Todd Boehly, came after ten minutes when Vinicius Junior hit the post to end what was a strong start from Chelsea. Madrid began to find joy attacking into the acres of space being vacated by the Blues, in eerie resemblance to their haphazard display against Brentford on the weekend. Benzema helped Vinicius break free down the left on 21 minutes and the Brazilian’s cross met his strike partner, who elegantly directed a powerful header in at Edouard Mendy’s near-post. Just two minutes later, it was 2-0. Luka Modric clipped in a cross from the right and Benzema again produced a stunning header, directed back across Mendy and into the far-post, for his 36th goal of the campaign. SPONSORED Chelsea gradually got back into the tie and went into the break with a sense of confidence, courtesy of Kai Havertz’s own header past Thibaut Courtois, which was followed by a miss from the simplest of positions from Benzema. Thomas Tuchel enthusiastically threw on Mateo Kovacic and Hakim Ziyech for the start of the second-half and yet, only 46 seconds after the whistle, Mendy underhit a pass some 30 yards out of his goal and Antonio Rudiger was too soft on Benzema as the striker stole in to roll home his hat-trick goal. Courtois denied Cesar Azpilicueta an immediate route back into the tie but the subdued home crowd were waiting for a moment of magic that failed to come quickly - prompting the introduction of Romelu Lukaku from the bench. The Belgian promptly saw two headers, the latter from a particularly good position, skew off-target as Chelsea continued to create chances but lacked conviction. The defending champions have it all to do at the Bernabeu in six days’ time. ",positive,liverpool,0

England have won all six of their games in Group D and, if they beat North Macedonia and Northern Ireland over the coming week, and Austria fail to take maximum points, Sarina Wiegman’s side will qualify with two games to spare. As well as Williamson, England will need to contend without Alex Greenwood and Lotte Wubben-Moy on Friday.

After making it past the group stage and eliminating Juventus in the round of 16, the modest Spanish club took a big step toward reaching the semifinals by holding on to a slim victory against favorite Bayern at the La Ceramica Stadium. Danjuma’s goal early in the first half was enough for Villarreal, with Bayern unable to get past the solid defense of Unai Emery’s squad and losing only for the second time in 30 Champions League matches. Bayern was unbeaten in its last 22 away games in the Champions League, with 17 wins and five draws in a record run that had started after a loss in 2017 to a Paris Saint-Germain team coached by Emery. The return leg is next week in Munich, where Villarreal will need a draw to get to the semifinals for the first time since its first last-four appearance in the Champions League in 2006. SPONSORED In the other quarterfinal Wednesday, defending champion Chelsea lost 3-1 to Real Madrid in the first leg in London. Villarreal looked in control from the start and Bayern struggled to create significant scoring chances. The hosts threatened the most and had some good chances to add to its lead. Danjuma opened the scoring in the eighth minute by redirecting a close-range shot by Dani Parejo as the Bayern defense was caught off guard. It was Danjuma’s sixth goal in nine Champions League appearances this season, and seventh in 11 career games in the competition. Villarreal thought it had doubled the lead in the 41st but Francis Coquelin’s goal from a tough angle was disallowed for offside. Striker Gerard Moreno twice had opportunities to add to Villarreal’s lead after that. First with a low shot from outside the area that hit the post in the 53rd, and 10 minutes later after intercepting a bad pass by Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer near midfield and missing his long-range shot into the open net. The ball ended up curling too much as Neuer desperately tried to run back into position. Bayern increased the pressure near the end but again it was Villarreal that nearly added to the lead when substitute Alfonso Pedraza missed from close range on a counterattack in the 87th. Villarreal did a good job containing Robert Lewandowski throughout the match and he had few opportunities inside the area. He entered the match as the Champions League’s leading scorer with 12 goals from eight matches and had scored seven goals in his last five games in all competitions. The Poland striker is ranked third on the all-time list of Champions League scorers, behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Bayern’s Canadian player Alphonso Davies made his first appearance since Dec. 17 after a long injury layoff because of cardiac issues. Villarreal, based in a city of about 50,000 people, is playing in the quarterfinals for the first time in 13 years. It qualified for the Champions League by winning last season’s Europa League. Bayern was eliminated by PSG at this stage last season. The German club made it to the last eight 10 times in the last 11 seasons. The team is playing in the quarterfinals for a record 20th time. The winner will play either Benfica or Liverpool in the semifinals. Liverpool won the first leg in Lisbon 3-1. Additional reporting from AP ",positive,liverpool,2

An expert at navigating one-off European ties, Emery faces a daunting task.

Now with Unai Emery at Villarreal, the Frenchman had to bide his time in north London before establishing himself as a regular towards the end of Arsene Wenger’s time in charge. Thrust back into the starting lineup to cover for injuries only a short time after joining Charlton on loan, Coquelin formed an impressive midfield pivot with Cazorla in particular, one that helped Arsenal beat Manchester City away from home in 2015. Largely, traveling to other big six teams had been a miserable experience for the club but Coquelin - at least for a short while - proved an internal solution of sorts and played the entirety of the FA Cup final win over Aston Villa later that year. Ultimately, he would join Valencia in January 2018 after falling out favour, before moving to Villarreal in the summer of 2020. Ahead of their Champions League clash with Bayern Munich on Wednesday, Coquelin spoke in glowing terms about some of his former teammates. “It was amazing!” he told So Foot. “I was playing with Santi Cazorla and Mesut Özil in front of me. I could send them rubbish balls, and they controlled them with ease. “The understanding I had with Cazorla particularly stayed with me. He’s really impressive. I could do what I wanted on the pitch, I knew he would always there as a guarantee.” ",positive,liverpool,0
81,https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/gareth-bale-wales-real-madrid-b991402.html,Underappreciated Gareth Bale has earned the right to do what he wants during twilight of a brilliant career,"n August, Gareth Bale gave an interview to the Observer which was almost comical in its non-committal blandness. Even by the standards of professional footballers, Bale managed to give very little away over the course of 16 quick-fire questions. He answered “nothing” to queries about what made him unhappy and what he would change about his past, and revealed he “wouldn’t want anyone else” to play him in a biopic. Asked what he had wanted to be when growing up, Bale, who appeared to be promoting Rowbots gym, said: “I just wanted to fulfil my potential.” There was almost nothing to be gleaned about Bale the man, his motivations or desires, but one answer, perhaps, did contain a degree of poignancy. Asked for his greatest fear, Bale replied: “Not being the best version of myself. In football and in life.” Bale is one of the finest and most successful British players of his generation, maybe of all time, but there is still a case that he has not been the “best version” of himself on the pitch in recent years. He has played just two hours of football for Real Madrid in the past six months and last started more than 15 League games in a season in 2018-19. Whatever the true circumstances of Bale’s Real purgatory, these are clearly not the statistics of a player determined to squeeze every last drop from his talent. Bale almost single-handedly dragging Wales through their World Cup play-off against Austria last week proved he is still one of the sport’s ultimate clutch players and foremost magicians, but it is intriguing to compare him to his former Real team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo. Both are sublimely gifted players, but Ronaldo has maintained an unquenchable thirst for goals, records and the limelight, which is no longer shared by Bale, at least at club level. Instead, the 32-year-old’s focus has been reduced to the singular goal of reaching the World Cup with Wales, to the point where he is considering retirement immediately after the tournament and could hang up his boots in June if they do not qualify. For anyone who has enjoyed Bale’s brilliance over the years, there is a degree of frustration in knowing that he is still good enough to elevate this stodgy Real side to another level, as he has done for his country. He could have been the club’s post-Ronaldo inspiration. This is seemingly part of the reason for the bile spewed at Bale by the Spanish media. He has seen Real for what they really are — questionable employers and a big business — and by refusing to play their game, he has not only humiliated them, he has fundamentally weakened them. And, given Bale’s well-documented treatment in Spain, why shouldn’t he? Bale, do not forget, worked every bit as hard as Ronaldo to reach the top, transforming himself from a skinny left-back, who was nearly released by Southampton and then nearly sold by Tottenham to Birmingham, into one of the world’s most explosive forwards, at one point behind only the Portuguese and Lionel Messi. If his fire no longer burns so brightly, that is understandable and okay. To despise Bale for wanting to enjoy the fruits of his labours or to scold him for not maintaining a laser-focus on self-improvement would be to hold footballers to dramatically different standards to everyone else. For players, football is a job, the game is a professional environment and, for the majority, their clubs are employers rather than passion projects. How many of us would continue to give our all in the twilight of our careers in a profession where we had already reached the top, achieved almost everything possible, if we then found ourselves saddled with an employer who did not really want us and a succession of bosses who sided with our detractors? In an age when we are increasingly told to enjoy ourselves and maintain a proper work-life balance, Bale appears to be doing just that as he winds down his Real contract, all while continuing to reach extraordinary levels for Wales. Having achieved what he has for Real, Bale has earned the right to disengage from the club’s psychodrama: to play golf, to spend time with his family, to prioritise his country, to give bland interviews and to promote rowing machines. This may not be the best version of Bale “in football”, but perhaps it is “in life”, which is ultimately more important. ",positive,liverpool,0

The 32-year-old scored twice in a sensational win for Wales at the Cardiff City Stadium on Thursday night to overcome Austria in their World Cup play-off semi-final. Marca called the Welsh captain a ""parasite"" and accused him of faking a back injury that kept him out of Real Madrid’s humiliating loss to Barcelona at the weekend, four days before he scored both goals in Wales’s win over Austria in their World Cup playoff game. ""At a time where people are taking their own lives because of the callousness and relentless of the media, I want to know, who is holding these journalists and the news outlets that allow them to write articles like this, accountable?"" Bale asked in a statement on his social media accounts. ""Fortunately I have developed a thick skin but that doesn’t mean articles like these don’t cause damage and upset those at the receiving end of these malicious stories."" The former Tottenham forward has played only a handful of games at Real Madrid this season and Spanish media criticised him for missing their 4-0 home loss in the Clasico on Sunday with an apparent back injury. Marca ran a headline on Friday calling Bale ""The Welsh parasite"" and columnist Manuel Julia criticised his work ethic at Real. ""He settled in Spain, at Real Madrid, where he sucks the blood (and the euros) of his host without giving anything in return. Unlike others of its kind, such as the flea, the louse or the bedbug, the Parasite Bale does not cause itching or diseases, he just laughs with jocular contempt in a humiliating ceremony, which, luckily, has an expiration date, like all misfortunes,"" Julia wrote. Diario AS said the winger had played only four of Real’s 29 league games this season and did not attend the Clasico at the Santiago Bernabeu to support his colleagues. ""Bale. Go. Home. Now. In that order,"" read the headline on a column by AS editor-in-chief Tomas Roncero. ""Last night he rose again, as a kind of Braveheart of the country of the Dragon with a formidable performance. Real Madrid would be proud of him if it weren’t for the fact that four days ago he left the team stranded, alluding to a false back injury, and miserably erased himself from the Clasico against Barca."" Bale, whose season has been repeatedly disrupted by injury, added in his statement: ""I have witnessed the toll the media can take on people’s mental and physical health. ""I hope that by the time our children are of an age where they are able to ingest news, that journalism ethics and standards will have been enforced more stringently."" The playoff semi-final between Scotland and Ukraine has been postponed until June because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Bale joined Real in 2013 and his contract expires in June.

Ndombele scored on his return to London on Thursday night as loan club Lyon held West Ham to a 1-1 draw in the Europa League quarter-final first leg. The maverick Frenchman returned to his former club on a deal until the end of the season on deadline day in January and Lyon have the option to re-sign him permanently for £54million in the summer - roughly the same fee Spurs paid them in summer 2019. However, neither Spurs nor Ndombele expect Lyon to exercise the option given the prohibitive sum involved, leaving the 25-year-old’s future uncertain. Head coach Antonio Conte sees no future for Ndombele at Spurs, where he will still have three years on his contract in the summer, but the hope is that his performances back at Lyon will prompt interest from other clubs. Ndombele is not the only expensive Spurs signing to have impressed on loan this week, with Giovani Lo Celso named man of the match in Villareal’s 1-0 win over Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter-final first leg. Conte says he is happy for Lo Celso but suggested the Argentine was not suited to English football and insisted the decision to loan him back to Spain until the end of the season was still the right one for Spurs. ""I’m really happy for his great performance,"" Conte said. ""He needed to play with regularity, with continuity. For this reason he went to Spain in a league he knows very well because he played very well and Tottenham bought him when he played in that league. ""To go back there and show he’s in good form is good for everybody, especially because Tottenham paid a lot of money for him. I am very happy because he is playing every game, he’s showing he’s a good player. ""I never said he’s not a good player. I said this league is very difficult because it is not enough to have great quality and it’s important to play with great intensity and strength. But now he is playing with regularity and I am very happy for him. The club made the right choice, yes."" ",positive,liverpool,0

Gets to the byline, cuts it back for Pepe who looks set to sweep it home but Dunk comes flying in to block. 82 mins: Lokonga joins the massive list of players to get a yellow card this afternoon. Welbeck brings it forward, Lokonga swiftly comes across and hacks him down. Referee didn’t need to think about that one. 78 mins: Pepe cuts inside, looks for the far corner but the shot is charged down. Dribbles out for a corner. Another terrible delivery.

Brazilian gave everything, Arsenal’s brightest player by a margin. 71 mins: Free-kick Arsenal in a great position. They need a goal back quickly. Taken short and comes to nothing. What a waste. Arsenal caught out by the cutback again. It is a lack of concentration from the defenders and the midfield to keep leaving players in space like that. Wonderful finish from Mwepu - but where are the red shirts? IT’S TWO! Stunning finish from Mwepu. Lovely move from Brighton, Trossard sets Caicedo free with a great flick. He dinks it back to the edge of the box where Mwepu sweeps it home first time. 65 mins: Xhaka too strong in midfield for Mwepu... or not. Referee gives the free-kick. Safe to say the home fans and the Arsenal players do not agree. 63 mins: Smith Rowe off, Nketiah on. Big chance for Saka! Cross is headed out to him on the edge of the area. Never looked confident and he balloons the shot well over the bar. 61 mins: First one flicked out for Lacazette, so Brighton get another chance. Dunk gets on the end of this one, comfortable save for Ramsdale though. 60 mins: The Gunners have pinned Brighton right back. That is until Smith Rowe gives it away and Mwepu shows superb composure, nutmegging the Arsenal man and striding forward. Played out wide to Cucurella, and it’s the Seagulls who have a corner this time. 58 mins: Arsenal will have another chance to produce from a corner. Martinelli swings it in, headed away. Odegaard goes for goal from the rebound, easily blocked. Gunners keep the pressure on though and Cedric puts it back into the box... Bissouma heads it away for, you guessed it, a corner. 56 mins: Another Arsenal corner, but again Brighton deal with it. Sanchez off his line to claim.

James Robson will be providing expert analysis from the ground! Better from Arsenal this half. They are taking the game to Brighton and asking more questions than they did before the break. Still clear cut chances being created though - and Brighton are doing a good job of shutting them down by fair means or foul. 53 mins: Caicedo slides in this time, and the referee does give the foul. He also gets a yellow-card. Martinelli playing left-back but there’s very little defensive work being done. Focus is all on getting forward. 50 mins: Saka pokes the ball past Veltman, goes to ground. Free-kick given and yellow card shown.... to Saka. Referee deems it to have been a dive. 48 mins: Strong driving run from Lokonga and he wins Arsenal a free-kick in a great position. Three players standing over it. It will be Cedric... straight into the wall. Off and running again. Looks like Martinelli has dropped deeper and Xhaka has gone into midfield. 54% possession, six shots, one on target for Arsenal in the first 45 minutes. Brighton with five shots and also just the on target - it was that one that mattered though from Trossard. The Seagulls lead at the break through Trossard’s strike. Arsenal thought they had an equaliser, but after a four-minute check VAR deemed Martinelli to have been offside. On the whole it’s been poor from the Gunners again - they are stumbling at just the wrong time of the season. Arsenal thought they were back in it right on the stroke of half time. It was a mighty close call, but Martinelli is ruled offside and so Brighton lead at the break. A long, long check. VAR struggling to find a right angle with all the bodies in the box. OFFSIDE!

James Robson will be providing expert analysis from the ground! 34 mins: Xhaka has space 25 yards out, is urged to shoot and does so. Poor effort. Arsenal fans might want to be a bit more careful with what they ask for when it comes to Xhaka and shooting... 31 mins: Arsenal need to keep getting the ball to Martinelli. So dangerous when he gets it, another great cross finds Gabriel but he gets the header all wrong and Brighton can clear. And just like Brighton are in front. Horrible defending from Arsenal, with everyone ignoring Trossard, who was left in acres of space by simply checking his run into the box. He still had plenty to do after Mwepu’s cutback - but superbly picked his spot, despite a crowd in the six yard box. BRIGHTON TAKE THE LEAD! Just as Arsenal were starting to get a bit of control. Far too easy. Long ball lumped forward to Mwepu, who has so much space. He cuts it back into the box, Trossard runs onto it and fires past Ramsdale. Arsenal are enjoying their best period now and should be ahead through Gabriel. Saka’s inviting cross to the far post just needed to be headed on target - but Gabriel fired into the side netting. Still, it’s more positive from the home side after such a dour opening 25 minutes. 26 mins: Free-kick now for the Gunners, Gabriel fouled by Cucurella who barges into the centre-back. Arsenal want to take it quickly, referee pulls it back. Will be Saka to take at the second time of asking... SO CLOSE! Superb cross to the back post, Gabriel can only head it into the side netting though. 25 mins: Much better from the Gunners! Martinelli sparks them into life. Drives straight at the defence, great cut-back into the box... Smith Rowe and Saka both go for the same ball and get in each other’s way. Eventually Saka gets a shot away, but the space has gone and it’s deflected behind for a corner. Cedric takes, Bissouma heads it out. 23 mins: Before the international break, Arsenal looked full of confidence and energy in attack. No sign of that at Selhurst Park and again they’re struggling this afternoon. Odegaard has barely had a touch, while Saka hasn’t been able to get on the ball at all. 20 mins: Terrible pass from Lokonga, straight to Welbeck and Brighton can go back on the attack. Veltman plays it long though to no-one in particular, White can head it away. Martinelli goes in slightly late on Veltman, free-kick for Brighton. Painful minute for Veltman in more ways than one. Brighton have taken control. Arsenal’s passing is really scrappy and Brighton are picking up the pieces much better than Arteta’s side. Still no real chances for either team though.

Tierney had surgery on his left knee yesterday after complaining of discomfort in it during a training session last Thursday. The Scotland international missed Monday’s defeat to Crystal Palace and he is expected to be out for the rest of the season. Tierney’s surgery, however, has been a success and that will boost his hopes of being fit for Scotland’s World Cup play-off semi-final against Ukraine in June. “Op went well. Thank you so much for all the messages of support. Really appreciate it,” Tierney wrote on Instagram late last night. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta faces a dilemma as to how he replaces Tierney in his defence, starting at home to Brighton tomorrow. Nuno Tavares is the back-up left-back in the squad, but struggled at Palace on Monday night and was taken off at half-time. Arteta could move Cedric Soares to left-back, however that option appears off the cards for two more weeks as right-back Takehiro Tomiyasu is still out with a calf issue. Granit Xhaka could also fill in for Tierney, although Thomas Partey being out with a thigh problem means Arsenal are light in midfield. “Monday was an extremely frustrating night for me personally, for the team and the fans,” Nuno wrote on Instagram. “It’s important to pick ourselves up, learn from the mistakes and react positively for Saturday’s game. Still a lot to fight for.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Gordon goal - Premier League result, match stream and latest updates today","nthony Gordon boosted Everton’s hopes of Premier League survival as his first-half strike proved the difference in a scrappy affair against Manchester United. Gordon’s deflected effort before the half hour alleviated the pressure on Frank Lampard after a 3-2 midweek defeat at relegation rivals Burnley had left Everton just a solitary point above the drop zone. This was far from a vintage display from either side but a 1-0 win for the Toffees puts daylight between themselves and the bottom three as United’s top-four ambitions suffered another untimely dent. Marcus ashford was thwarted twice early on by Jordan Pickford but Cristiano Ronaldo was largely subdued as United remain cut adrift from the Champions League places after being downed by Gordon’s shot, which thudded into visiting captain Harry Maguire and left goalkeeper David De Gea stranded. Pickford was again called upon in time added on to deny Ronaldo on the half-volley after being teed up by Maguire before the referee’s whistle for full-time was greeted by an eruption of noise. SPONSORED The quality has been poor but Everton won’t care. United have been dreadful so far. A good result so far for Tottenham and Arsenal in the fight for fourth. As it stands, Everton are four points clear of Burnley and the relegation zone. Burnley take on bottom club Norwich City tomorrow so this would be a huge three points if Everton can hold on. Half-time: Everton 1-0 Manchester United A narrow lead for Everton at the break. A big 45 minutes coming up. 41 mins: Brilliant defending from Mykolenko! A cross from the left looks primed for Ronaldo to head home at the back post but Mykolenko gets there first to head the ball behind. A poor corner is then headed away by Richarlison. 38 mins: Telles has a cross blocked. Pogba is then caught late in the middle of the pitch, the referee waves play on as Fernandes has the ball but it comes to nothing. Here is that Gordon goal... 35 mins: Fred cannot continue and Pogba comes on in place of him. 34 mins: Everton close to a second! A shot from Richarlison takes a huge deflection and De Gea does brilliantly to tip the ball over the bar. 31 mins: Fred is walking a bit gingerly. He's gestured towards the dugout and Pogba has been sent out to warm-up. 30 mins: Everton come forward again, Keane gets his head to a free-kick but hit goes over. The ball falls kindly for Gordon on the edge of the area, he hits it first time and it takes a big deflection off the back of United captain Maguire and David de Gea is wrong-footed. A huge goal!

One of Europe’s most exciting young forwards, the 22-year-old has scored 18 times in 41 appearances across all competitions this season, alerting the interest of a number of big clubs around Europe. While the forward, who made his Netherlands debut at Euro 2020, does have a contract running until the summer of 2026, PSV are reportedly open to the idea of cashing in on their academy graduate at the end of the season. Arsenal are on the hunt for a new forward following the departure of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang with manager Mikel Arteta focusing on signing young players to fit alongside the developing team he currently has at his disposal. Liverpool and Bayern Munich are just some of the teams to have been touted as potential landing spots, Gakpo revealed the Premier League was a destination he’d be open to, as well as how he took inspiration from Arsenal legend Thierry Henry. “The Premier League is a big league,” he told The Sun. “Virgil van Dijk plays there with Liverpool so I like to watch them. “We are not the same kind of league but I think we try to look at the Prem and learn about it. Everybody wants to play one time in the Prem. I don’t favour one team but I like Arsenal a lot. “I looked up to Henry when I was younger because he was a tall guy who played on the wing.” ",positive,liverpool,2

""It depends on the strategy of Wolves also, that’s why it was so hard to find players in the last two transfer windows,"" Lage added.

The goalkeeper, who was this week named runner-up to Gianluigi Donnarumma as Europe’s finest No1, was also culpable when conceding a penalty in the 3-2 defeat. Mendy twice had the chance to clear the danger after Jorginho’s under-hit back-pass, but was panicked into bringing down Jarrod Bowen under pressure from the winger. He was then beaten by Arthur Masuaku’s swerving cross late on, which secured the win for the home side. Tuchel said: “Edou is dealing with a rough period. I don’t know why exactly, but he seems to have lost a bit of confidence. Okay, his decision-making was not on the highest level today with the first goal, but we also bring him to a really awkward situation. “He could have saved the situation, but he did not. We are far, far away from blaming anybody, but we need to admit that we do too many crucial mistakes at the moment that cost us a win against Man United and today as well.” Chelsea’s manager was heavily critical of his players after their 2-1 win against Watford in midweek but despite their sloppiness costing them on Saturday, he refused to lay into the team after only their second Premier League defeat of the season. He added: “I didn’t see our performance dip against Man United or today. I think the performance is enough to even win the game, but what we clearly see is we give easy goals away and this is very unusual. “We make big mistakes that lead to big chances that lead to easy goals. We do this now in three matchdays against Man United, Watford and again today. If you do this at this kind of level, you can’t expect to have a result. “The (title) race is not interesting at the moment. What is interesting is always the next 90 minutes and what is interesting is to have the focus right, the attitude right, and to take care about the details. “We are not good enough on the details at the moment. We do too many big mistakes and have to care about the details. “There is no need to ask questions or start doubting about the big picture. This is a game if you play at West Ham about the details. I can only repeat myself: without doing big mistakes, there is a big chance we win this game.” ",positive,liverpool,0

Salah’s current deal at Anfield runs out in the summer of 2023, meaning the forward is out of contract in less than 18 months. Reports recently suggested that he was close to agreeing a new one that would keep him at Liverpool for the rest of his career. Klopp did not comment on those rumours, though insisted he is not worried about the fact no agreement has yet been reached. “I’m happy with it because there’s nothing new to say,” Klopp said ahead of Liverpool’s Champions League clash against Benfica. “It is good. The decisive parties are talking to each other and that’s all I need.” While Salah has been in impressive form for his club this season, he’s had a painful time of things at international level with Egypt. The 29-year-old and his country were beaten by Senegal in the Africa Cup of Nations final earlier this year, before Sadio Mane’s team also beat them in a World Cup play-off which means Salah will not be in Qatar later this year.

But that is also the allure. Pochettino is proven in the Premier League, but also proven to have failed to win the title when in a two-horse race with Leicester. Proven to have been unable to arrest Tottenham’s alarming slide that ultimately cost him his job. That is, of course, a very simplistic assessment of his time in England. He was also proven to have handled his transition to this country by turning Southampton into one of the most watchable teams in the top-flight. Proven to have nurtured individual talents at Spurs, regularly competing at the top of the table and reaching the Champions League Final in 2019 – famously at the expense of Ten Hag’s Ajax. If he lasts the course at Paris Saint-Germain this season, he will be a title-winner. Yet Ten Hag has emerged from a series of talks as the man United want to lead them into a new era. And for all the due diligence of football director John Murtough and technical director Darren Fletcher, perhaps it is the mystery surrounding the Dutchman that gives him the edge. United cannot know if he will be able to adapt to the Premier League after a career spent in the Netherlands and Germany. They cannot know if he can handle a club of such stature that even managerial heavyweights like Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho were swallowed up by the expectation. They cannot know how he will cope with the egos in a dressing room full of fabulously wealthy young men, nor how those players will react to him. He is not the safe option, yet feels like the populist one, given the clamour on social media to declare him the next big thing. That is what new chief executive Richard Arnold is banking on. Ajax boss Erik ten Hag is set to become the next permanent manager of Manchester United His predecessor Ed Woodward spent the majority of his reign regretting his failure to lure Klopp to United, with his ‘adult Disneyland’ pitch now becoming the stuff of legend. He watched the German do to Liverpool what a succession of managers failed to replicate at Old Trafford, waking them from their slumber and turning them into a super power. Even now, Klopp is the most perfect choice for United in terms of personality, leadership and his brand of football. More so even than Pep Guardiola. Klopp just gets it – and, the uncomfortable truth is that he probably got precisely what United were when rejecting Woodward’s advances. Can Ten Hag be Klopp mark two? That is the bet being made by Arnold, Murtough and Fletcher. For a start, the football is right. It is about risk, relentless attacking and bravery on the ball. It is proactive in the form of a Klopp or a Guardiola, rather than reactive like a Mourinho. It is of the school of dominating possession – as would be expected of a Dutchman – but not the type of risk-averse fare that so turned United fans off during Van Gaal’s reign. Ten Hag gives freedom to his most exciting talents to showcase their skills. Jadon Sancho should be a big beneficiary and Marcus Rashford may rediscover himself under a coach who will nurture his attacking qualities, which have been lost over the past 18 months. Ten Hag has been preferred by the United hierarchy to long-term target Mauricio Pochettino Hakim Ziyech and Donny van de Beek are two players who have failed to replicate the form they showed under Ten Hag since leaving Ajax. Van de Beek will welcome his arrival at Old Trafford after being bafflingly under-used since joining United. Ten Hag has taken the fans along with him on his Ajax journey and United are in need of a ringmaster at Old Trafford who they can truly get behind. Their fans are good at supporting their managers, even if they have been tested by the thin gruel offered up post-Sir Alex Ferguson. Van Gaal and Mourinho tried to re-educate them in what they should expect as supporters of the biggest club in the land. Neither could put up particularly convincing arguments – Mourinho snarling, and Van Gaal just never quite getting the sense of jeopardy that keeps them coming back to Old Trafford. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer did – and arguably provided supporters with more memorable moments than those two predecessors combined – but did not possess the coaching or managerial qualities to deliver trophies. Ten Hag is a proven winner in the Netherlands, but that record comes with a ‘but’ for that very reason. Ajax are the biggest and the richest, so success comes hand in hand. That is why that Champions League run is so instructive. Ten Hag has drawn favourable comparisons to Liverpool counterpart Jurgen Klopp The irony, of course, is that Pochettino’s Tottenham reached the final at Ajax’s expense. What is the greater achievement? Pochettino plays progressive, aggressive football. Ask Spurs fans if he has the charisma to make people follow him. It is hard to think of a box Ten Hag ticks that the Argentine does not. Well, that is, all except one – the element of the unknown. ",positive,liverpool,2

The head coach suggested he was ""too honest"" and ambitious to continue collecting his salary when results are not improving, and warned Spurs would have to be careful not be dragged into a relegation battle. His comments came in a dramatic press conference following the 1-0 defeat at Turf Moor, and will spark fresh fears that Conte could walk away from the club before the end of the season.

Sessegnon trained on Thursday but has not played since March 7 due to another hamstring injury and Conte is likely to be more cautious with the England Under-21 international.

With Conte unlikely to change his system nor rest Heung-min Son or Dejan Kulusevski, Bergwijn will likely have to settle for the role of super sub again, along with the likes of Lucas Moura, Harry Winks and Davinson Sanchez, who are trusted by Conte but not part of his strongest team.

Thomas Frank’s side went behind to Antonio Rudiger’s stunner, but Eriksen’s strike sandwiched between two from Vitaly Janelt put the visitors in dreamland at Stamford Bridge, before substitute Yoane Wissa completed the thrashing late on. The 4-1 victory moves Brentford on to 33 points and surely secures their Premier League status, 11 points clear of the drop in 14th. Ivan Toney wasted two early chances for the visitors as Edouard Mendy made an uncharacteristically shaky start in the Chelsea goal, but the home side gradually grew into the game and were on top at the break. It took just three minutes of the second half for them to find a breakthrough as Rudiger let fly from all of 35 yards and his effort flew in off the post, leaving David Raya no chance. That prompted wild celebrations but Stamford Bridge was silenced within two minutes as Janelt swept Bryan Mbeumo’s lay-off into the top corner and by the hour-mark a remarkable turnaround was complete. First, Mbuemo raced away down the left on the counter-attack and as N’Golo Kante was dragged across to cover, fed Eriksen in the middle to finish past Mendy. Then, Toney slipped Janelt in and from a tight angle the German lifted superbly over the Blues ‘keeper to give the Bees breathing space. Kai Havertz missed two excellent opportunities to give Chelsea late hope before Wissa came off the bench to put them out of their misery three minutes from time. ",negative,liverpool,0

Thomas Tuchel declared their quarter-final against Real Madrid as dead, despite it only being half-time in that tie. His downbeat comments after Wednesday’s 3-1 defeat pointed to his deep-rooted concerns about his team and their ability to overturn this alarming slump. This next week is going to be the most pivotal of Chelsea’s season so far, with a trip to the Bernabeu and then Wembley, for their FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace. Here, Standard Sport assesses the immediate issues for Tuchel for fix to save the season: Chelsea felt near-invincible in the lead-up to the international break, but that confidence has been shattered by back-to-back defeats. A run of 12 wins from 13 games had breathed new life into their season and kept them fighting on three fronts. While no one saw the Brentford defeat coming, it still had the feel of an aberration. But perhaps Tuchel underestimated the effect such a heavy loss had on his players. From the moment Karim Benzema put Madrid ahead on Wednesday, Chelsea heads were all over the place. Going two goals down in 24 minutes rocked them to the core. Should they go behind to Southampton on Saturday, it will be another serious examination of their fragile self-belief. Speaking of fragile, Chelsea’s once near-impenetrable rearguard has never looked so flimsy under Tuchel. Madrid could not believe the space that opened up for them almost every time they advanced, with Andreas Christensen looking like a rabbit in the headlights when confronted by Vinicius Jr. Questions will naturally be asked about the effect his imminent move to Barcelona is having on him — and that is a situation that needs to be monitored. He is by no means the only problem — he was not even picked against Brentford — but his form has been crucial to Chelsea’s success over the past 18 months. If N’Golo Kante is Chelsea’s Superman, Madrid were his kryptonite. It says everything about his ineffectual display on Wednesday that Tuchel opted to remove him from the action at half time. When have Chelsea ever taken Kante off in a bid to turn a match? But it was easy to understand Tuchel’s thinking on the night, with Madrid repeatedly charging through midfield areas and Kante unable to prevent Luka Modric from dictating the game. Chelsea will have to hope it was that rarest of bad days at the office for Kante, as he will be crucial to their hopes of turning the tie around, as well as getting them over the line in the race for Champions League qualification via the League. Tuchel was honest enough to admit he did not give Christensen enough protection in a back-three, while his decision to leave Mateo Kovacic out of his starting XI was also curious, given the energy and penetration he could offer against the veteran legs of Modric and Toni Kroos. Against Brentford on Saturday, he decided to rest Reece James, which cost Chelsea his creative influence until he came on. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but Tuchel is the type to get the big calls right. At the moment, it feels like every mistake is being punished. Tuchel insists the sale of the club is having no impact on his players — and their form amid all of those off-field distractions had been outstanding. But the minute performances dipped on the pitch, a link was always going to be made. Tuchel has done a remarkable job of focusing minds, but the players would not be human if they did not pay attention to the stories swirling around the club. And in a week when prospective bidders have met with club officials, while sections of support have mobilised to give their own opinions, it may be a case of something finally giving. Tuchel was right to point out that Southampton is now Chelsea’s immediate priority, but their season hangs on that second leg at the Bernabeu. ",positive,liverpool,0

Many of the season’s top performers, including the likes of Mo Salah, Joao Cancelo and Trent Alexander-Arnold, feature against one another in Sunday’s huge title race meeting between Liverpool and Manchester City. That means managers may be looking elsewhere for their captaincy options this week, with in-form Tottenham pair Harry Kane and Heung-min Son sure to be popular choices. Here are the players we think you ought to be considering for you side... Aaron Ramsdale (Arsenal) | £5.1m SPONSORED The Gunners’ recent defensive frailties are a concern, with the absences of Kieran Tierney at left-back and Thomas Partey at the base of midfield expected to be keenly felt in the coming weeks. However, Brighton have scored just once in their last seven games. Matt Doherty (Tottenham) | £4.9m Doherty’s remarkable resurgence under Antonio Conte continued last week with a 14-point haul against Newcastle and with pretty favourable fixtures coming up he’s a budget defensive option with plenty of upside. Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace) | £4.5m Similar could be said of Guehi, who has three successive clean sheets in an impressive Palace backline and is a major threat at set-pieces, as Everton found out in the FA Cup. They have one of the kindest runs between now and the end of the season, too. Fabian Schar (Newcastle) | £4.3m Cheaper still is the Newcastle defender who got himself on the scoresheet while on set-piece duty against Tottenham last week. The Toon have three successive home fixtures coming up, including two in double game week 33. Kai Havertz (Chelsea) | £7.9m Chelsea’s dip in form has put us off including defensive options like Reece James and Antonio Rudiger in this list but Havertz makes the cut as he continues to threaten as an out-of-position forward. Rotation is a slight concern, given the trip to Madrid in midweek, but any more dropped league points could see Thomas Tuchel’s side dragged into the race for Champions League qualification. Heung-min Son (Tottenham) | £11.0m The South Korean has racked up 27 points across the last two gameweeks and there would look to be the potential for more double-digit hauls across Spurs’ next four fixtures before those crunch meetings with Liverpool and Arsenal in May. Kevin de Bruyne (Man City) | £11.7m The only player involved in Sunday’s huge title clash is the Belgian, who has been back to his very best in recent weeks and has a habit of delivering in these big games. He also remains a strong differential option, too. James Maddison (Leicester) | £6.9m Few teams have as enticing a fixture list between now and the end of the season as Leicester and while Crystal Palace are in good form as they visit the King Power this weekend, Newcastle and Everton are next up in double gameweek 33. Harry Kane (Tottenham) | £12.5m That Kane’s sensational performance against Newcastle last weekend ended in only a four-point haul will have been a source of immense frustration for FPL bosses, but that was his lowest return since a blank in gameweek 26 and there’s no reason to get rid of him now.

The situation now is not quite as dire as it was in January, when Lokonga was the only fit and available centralmidfielder, but Thomas Partey’s injury this week means the Belgian must once again step up for the Gunners. Partey injured his thigh during Arsenal’s 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday and scans have shown muscle damage. The Ghanaian has not given up hope of playing again this season and, while he has a better chance of doing so than Kieran Tierney, it still looks unlikely. “It’s what we have, it’s the numbers we have,” said boss Mikel Arteta. “We’ve lost Kieran and we’ve lost Thomas now — and that’s it. With the players we have, we will keep trying like we have since the start of the season, but we never had a big squad, so we can’t find any excuses.” The situation provides Lokonga with the opportunity to finish the campaign strongly after an indifferent few months. It has been a season of two halves for the 22-year-old, who during the first five months got more minutes than he might have expected, due to Granit Xhaka being sidelined. Since the turn of the year, though, it has been a different story, and Lokonga’s only Premier League start since then was against Burnley in January. Despite his lack of minutes, the midfielder was named in Belgium’s squad last month — and that is testament to their faith in him. Arsenal have similarly high hopes for the youngster and now he has nine games to show why. A top-four finish remains in theGunners’ hands as, while they are sat fifth, they are level on points withTottenham immediately above them and have a game in hand on their north London rivals. Lokonga’s return to the team could see a shift in formation against Brighton on Saturday. Arsenal have been playing a 4-3-3 recently, but that has been reliant on Partey excelling at the base of their midfield. Trusting Lokonga to do the same would be a tall order and, instead, Arteta may look to revert to a 4-2-3-1, playing the experienced Xhaka next to the Belgian in a two-man pivot. It should give Arsenal a solid base and, at a time when their form is threatening to falter, that seems invaluable. ",negative,liverpool,0

The co-owner of the LA Dodgers has made the use of analytics central to his success with his baseball team, who won the World Series in 2020. A fundamental part of that has been the development of home-grown players or bargain finds — and improving the ratio of talent that progresses from Chelsea’s heralded academy to their first team is expected to be a focus of his ownership. While the Dodgers are also known for their mega-money signings, including the record £227million, 12-year deal for Mookie Betts in 2020 and a wage bill that has topped £240m, it is their success at using data to add value to players that has put them at the forefront of US sports. Raine Group, which is handling the sale of Chelsea, has told the four shortlisted bidders they need to commit a further £1billion as part of their proposals. That sum is intended to be put towards stadium renovations and the first-team playing squad to ensure that Chelsea can continue to compete at the top end of European football. A consortium led by Todd Boehly is one of four shortlisted bidders in the race to buy Chelsea The Dodgers’ spending power has made them one of the super powers in baseball, but it is their intelligent use of money that has underpinned such a period of dominance — winning eight straight National League West titles, as well as the World Series. Boehly has told people close to his bid that his ability to use money wisely is a reason why he is such a strong candidate to buy out Roman Abramovich. Under his ownership, the sort of wastage that has been absorbed by Abramovich’s fortune is unlikely to continue. The idea of allowing a Kevin De Bruyne, Mo Salah or even Declan Rice to depart before realising their potential could be a thing of the past. The Dodgers have utilised data-led strategies to unearth unheralded talent. Max Muncy is an example of how their scouting system uses the minor leagues to spot future stars with a Moneyball approach that was made famous in the film of the same name, starring Brad Pitt, about Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane and his mastering of metrics to identify talent. While Boehly has been part-owner since 2012, it is president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman who is the mastermind behind the Dodgers’ success. He would be the equivalent of a director of football, which will make planned conversations with Marina Granovskaia intriguing. Her future remains in doubt, but she runs Chelsea’s transfer policy on behalf of Abramovich. For all the credit she has received for money made from sales of the club’s academy prospects, she has also overseen a significant amount of waste. Kepa Arrizabalaga is the world’s most expensive goalkeeper but is only back-up to Edouard Mendy. Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rudiger are both free agents at the end of the season, which could see the best part of £100m of talent walk away for nothing. Romelu Lukaku, a club-record £97.5m signing, has also been pushed to the fringes because Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel is struggling to integrate him into his team. Boehly has enjoyed success as the part-owner of the LA Dodgers, who won baseball’s World Series in 2020 Boehly, who has joined with Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and property developer Jonathan Goldstein, is described as “hands off” in his ownership. But talking about his philosophy in a recent interview with Yahoo, there was much to encourage Chelsea fans. He said: “We’ve now [won] eight NL West titles in a row, we’ve got our World Series ring… and we want to keep winning. “You always just have to keep remembering that the fans are the centre. And the second that you veer, just go back to thinking about the fans, think about the fans, the fans. And if you are always the fans’ eyes and thinking about it from that perspective, and you have the good fortune of also having a major market like Los Angeles, those two things go together very nicely.” But Boehly is a man who also cares about profit. As the co-founder of Eldridge Industries, he has made his billions out of maximising investments. Mike Muncy is a prime example of the success of the Dodgers’ Moneyball-esque scouting system Media rights were a big draw for him when buying the Dodgers, describing them as “a really valuable investment-grade bond.” While the centralised nature of Premier League TV rights bargaining gives him less power at Chelsea, he will still see it as an opportunity to bring in enormous sums. Whether he can guarantee the same returns on the pitch is another matter entirely. ",positive,liverpool,0

The owners of baseball’s Chicago Cubs have met with key club officials this week and will hold further talks with the Supporters’ Trust in an effort to convince them they can lead the European champions to a bright future. The Ricketts have faced a backlash from fans on social media in response to historic racist emails sent by the family’s patriarch, Joe. He is not involved in the bid and the Ricketts’ have sought to meet with fan groups and other organisations to allay concerns, among them Chelsea Pride and Kick It Out. Ms Ricketts said: “When we assumed responsibility for the Chicago Cubs and its legacy, we immediately realised that teams like the Cubs don’t belong to one person or organisation. They belong to the fans. “We’re stewards – and we’re answerable to the fans. That’s how we see it in Chicago – and it would be exactly the same at Chelsea. “We strive to be champions both on and off the field. It’s what makes Chelsea great, and is a tradition we would honour if we were to become the club’s next stewards.” Ms Ricketts was the first openly LGBTQ+ owner of a Major League Baseball team and is adamant the family are committed to diversity. While there has still been unrest, a proposed protest last weekend only got a modest response with around 100 fans gathering before the game against Brentford. Laura Ricketts was the first openly LGBTQ+ owner of a Major League Baseball team Meanwhile, plans to erect a ‘NoToRicketts’ banner inside the ground have been shelved indefinitely. Ms Ricketts added: “We all need to be listening and speaking up, and I feel a particular responsibility because of the position I’m in. We’re not going to be able to persuade all the fans right away that we will be good stewards of Chelsea – we’re going to have to show them with meaningful action if we are successful in our bid. “But I can assure all Chelsea fans that it has been my life’s work to fight against discrimination and bigotry of any kind. “Coming out as an LGBTQ+ woman has influenced my perspective and sensitivity about diversity and inclusion. I can’t know what it’s like to walk in another person’s shoes, but I can begin to understand and have an awareness of their different experience. And that’s a gift. “In the position that I’m in, I feel a sense of responsibility to be an advocate. To me, being an advocate means speaking up, and also listening.” ",positive,liverpool,0

The Italian has been exasperated by his side’s defensive lapses which came back to haunt them in Saturday’s dramatic 3-2 defeat to Manchester United. He will focus on set-piece drills ahead of Wednesday’s trip to Brighton and Sunday’s home clash with West Ham. Spurs are six points adrift of fourth-placed Arsenal, having played a game more. It means there is little room for error after losing for the fifth time in their last eight Premier League matches. Conte’s frustration was palpable – not least because he knew this was another opportunity missed. And in a season when fourth place has been left wide open for any team willing to take it, it has been Arsenal who have seized the opportunity so far. This is a pivotal week for Spurs’ top four prospects. With Arsenal facing Liverpool on Wednesday, Conte’s side could make up ground on their north London rivals, as well as move within two points of United with a game in hand. But, even if they were to close the gap in midweek, such are Tottenham’s inconsistencies, that it is impossible to bank on them producing the kind of run required at this stage of the season. Conte touched on the legacy of Spurs’ frailties when dissecting defeat at Old Trafford. After watching Cristiano Ronaldo roll back the years with a vintage hat-trick at Old Trafford, he insists his side’s problems are of their own making. That is why he is determined to get down to business on the training pitch this week. “In the last period we have been conceding a lot of goals from set pieces, but we are working on this,” he said. “You have to know that this is a process because this team is a team that needs time, needs time to grow and improve, but I think you can see their improvement, a big improvement on the pitch. “You can see what they’re doing on the pitch, but in this process you need time and patience and then try to do this but I want to push my players, because our ambition has to be to stay very close to the top four. “We need a target to give us emotion, to give us the possibility to push ourselves. “We will analyse the situation and to try improve the set pieces because, I repeat, we are conceding a lot of goals from set pieces.” Conte has made it clear that he believes there is an opportunity to break into the Champions League places in a season in which United have been engulfed by turmoil. “I always say in England there are four teams in my opinion - City, United, Chelsea, Liverpool - that unless something goes wrong, the top four are these four clubs in my opinion,” he added. “But it can happen, as last season Liverpool struggled until the end for a place in the Champions League. “In this season United are struggling, and in this case, in this moment, there are three or four teams including Tottenham. We have to stay very close and fight.” ",positive,liverpool,3

The Hammers full-back was shown a straight red in injury time at the end of the first half for pulling back Moussa Dembele as he raced forward. It was a soft decision, especially considering Dembele was moving away from goal, and Moyes was also booked by the referee for his protests at the break. The West Ham manager pointed to a challenge on Jarrod Bowen in the build-up to the move which produced the red card - with Hassouem Aouar barging the forward to the ground. ""The only thing I’m going to say is the tackle in lead up to it on Jarrod was a foul in the same phase of play so I expect that to be bartered into it,"" said Moyes. ""That’s the disappointment for me. ""The only thing I want to focus on is if it’s a free kick on Jarrod. If it is I’d have expected VAR to check that. That’s what we do in the Premier League. It’s in the same phase of play."" West Ham responded to the second half with a goal through Bowen, before Tottenham loanee Tanguy Ndombele pulled one back for the visitors. Moyes was also bemused as to why a supporter charged onto the pitch as West Ham were breaking forward at 1-1 looking to find a winner and take a lead to Lyon for the second leg. ""I was [baffled],"" said Moyes. ""This is a really good football club, doing so many good things to improve but those things tonight certainly didn’t help the team.

Aaron Cresswell was shown a soft red card on the brink of half time and would have been fearing the worst as he trudged off. But his teammates stood up and showed a defiant response, taking the lead through Jarrod Bowen. Tottenham’s Tanguy Ndombele, on loan with the Ligue 1 club, levelled but West Ham stood firm and refused to collapse despite their disadvantage. It now all hangs on next week’s second leg in France. The Hammers had reached this point - their first European quarter-final in 41 years -thanks to a momentous evening at the London Stadium against Sevilla, overcoming a first leg deficit in superb style. This would be a different challenge. Not only was it a first leg but the Hammers were fancied as favourites given Lyon’s indifferent form domestically. It is only two years since the French side were in the semi-finals of the Champions League, however, and they are well versed in what makes the difference at this level. It was ahead of Sevilla that Moyes had warned of being drawn in by the dark arts, but the same could have applied here. A first half dominated by the visitors, making the most of small challenges, came to be defined by just that as a fine effort from West Ham was completely undone on the brink of the interval with Cresswell given his marching orders. After Moussa Dembele broke through the West Ham rearguard, Cresswell came flying back and, just as the former Fulham man poked the ball away from goal, he laid a soft hand on his shoulder, allowing the Frenchman the chance to go tumbling down and give German referee, Felix Zwayer, the chance to show a direct red. Cresswell, who on Wednesday said this was the biggest game of his 14-year professional career, slapped his hands across his face as Dembele sent a Cristiano Ronaldo style wink in the direction of a teammate. Moyes takes pride in his side having a backbone these days and they were able to show it here. The Scot earned himself a booking for venting his frustrations at Zwayer at the break but his team responded in a much better manner. With Lyon pushing forward Michail Antonio broke away and dragged them forward. Lyon recovered but gave possession up cheaply to Pablo Fornals on the edge of the box. After exchanging passes with Antonio the Spaniard moved to slip the ball into Bowen. Jerome Boateng, a World Cup winning defender, made a hash of intercepting, allowing Bowen to turn back and fire goal-ward, his shot deflecting past Anthony Lopes and in. It was scrappy, but after a first half in which they felt a sting of injustice - no one cared. Moyes raced onto the pitch in celebration rather than remonstration, pumping both fists back towards the main stand. The home fans partied as they had here last month against Sevilla, chants of “West Ham are massive” once again echoing around. This was not following quite the same fairytale script, though. Lyon were pinning West Ham back, looking to exploit their advantage, and quickly found the only defensive crack of the evening. Tete, the Brazilian signed from Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk last week, skipped past Ben Johnson - sent on after the red card - and crossed low. A slight touch from Alphonse Areola sent it into Ryan Fredericks, who blocked and could only watch as the impressive Tottenham loanee Ndomele poked home a leveller. From there, West Ham were resolute and determined to go to France with it all to play for. Areola saved from Lucas Paqueta and Emerson Palmeri while Kurt Zouma and Craig Dawson were robust in dealing with Dembele. Perhaps the biggest frustration for Moyes, Cresswell’s sending off aside, would have been towards one of his own supporters. West Ham were not just resting on their laurels but looking to break and cause Lyon trouble too. They were doing just that, Fornals fizzing a ball to the feet of Declan Rice, as one idiotic supporter burst onto the pitch and into the Lyon box, stopping proceedings. Moyes and his players were dumbstruck. The hosts had to quickly refocus, Areola palming away more efforts during eight minutes of added time and Antonio back putting his body on the line to block the rebound. That was not the home advantage they were looking for, especially as they look ahead to a second leg in front of a hostile crowd. West Ham do, however, go there with everything in the balance. Moyes will have his complaints over the sending off but he can have few about the response to it - this was another test passed by his side. ",positive,liverpool,0

Aaron Cresswell was sent off on the verge of half-time for pulling back Moussa Dembele, who the referee deemed would have been clean through on goal. Jarrod Bowen gave the Hammers an unlikely lead after the break to send the home fans into raptures, though Tanguy Ndombele then got the French side level on his return to England. In their first European quarter-final for more than 40 years and with depleted ranks for so much of the match, David Moyes will be thrilled that his side remain very much in the tie going into the second-leg in France next week. Lyon dominated possession almost from the very first whistle, though that suited West Ham just fine as they looked to break quickly when winning it back. Craig Dawson’s brilliant long ball found Said Benrahma, who tested Anthony Lopes from a tight angle with the first real chance of the match. Michail Antonio caused Lyon’s defence plenty of problems, while the home fans became increasingly frustrated with a number of decisions from the referee. That was turned up to another level when Cresswell was sent-off seconds before half-time. Dembele was played in behind, the West Ham left-back slightly pulled back the striker’s shoulder and the Lyon man went tumbling to the ground. The referee gave the free-kick and showed Cresswell a straight red, deciding that he had denied a clear goalscoring opportunity in what was a harsh decision on the home side. Ben Johnson was introduced in place of Benrahma at the break, as Moyes looked to keep his side in the tie. The focus may well have been on keeping Lyon out, but seven minutes into the second-half it was the hosts who stunned their opponents. Seconds after Antonio had a penalty appeal waved away, the Hammers pounced on a loose pass. Pablo Fornals’ bobbling effort rolled into the path of Bowen after Jerome Boateng, and his shot then deflected off the Lyon defender, over the goalkeeper and into the empty net. The visitors levelled though, midway through the half. Tete’s low cross was pushed out by Alphonse Areola, off Ryan Fredericks and perfectly into the path of Ndombele who had the simplest of finishes from just a few yards out. Lyon had an increasingly exclusive share of possession from that point onwards, as they looked to give themselves a lead to take back to France. West Ham held firm late on though to give themselves a real chance of still reaching the Europa League semi-finals. ",positive,liverpool,0

Aaron Cresswell was sent off in the first half stoppage-time for a tug on Moussa Dembele when the left back was deemed to be last man, infuriating David Moyes who was booked as he headed down the tunnel. Despite being a man down, the Hammers took the lead seven minutes after the restart, Bowen pouncing on a defensive error to score from close range. But Spurs loanee Ndombele ensured the tie will be finely poised in France next week when he finished from six yards after sloppy defending. Dan Kilpatrick was at the London Stadium to rate the West Ham players... Alphonse Areola 6 His faint touch on Tete’s cross wrong-footed Fredericks for Ndombele’s equaliser. Twice tested by Lyon in the final 15 minutes but stood tall. Ryan Fredericks 5 Made a mess of the cross for Lyon’s equaliser, atlhough Areola’s touch made it tough for him. Bravely saw out the game with a stitched up eyebrow after a nasty clash of heads. Craig Dawson 8 Sprayed a stunning diagonal to release Benrahma for a first-half chance and typically no-nonsense defensively. Kurt Zouma 7 Uncharacteristically sloppy on occasions but defended well when he had to, and arrowed some dangerous long balls towards Antonio as West Ham went direct. Aaron Cresswell 5 Red card was harsh - but arguably fair. Dembele went down easily, but Cresswell gave him the option by briefly grabbing his upper arm. Declan Rice 7 Always in the right place to snuff out Lyon attacks and drove forward well from midfield. Had to be more reserved in the second half. Did well to avoid the booking which would have ruled him out of the second leg. Tomas Soucek 6 Disciplined and hard working in the midfield but lacked his usual threat in the final third. Jarrod Bowen 8 Pounced on Jerome Boateng’s mistake to score and should have had an assist for Antonio with a fine run and cross. Another standout display from the Hammers’ in-form player. Said Benrahma 6 Can feel hard done to be the fall guy at half-time after a lively 45 minutes. Breached Lyon’s back line after a superb first touch from Dawson’s pass but his effort was saved. Pablo Fornals 8 Won possession in the build up to the goal and slipped the ball through to Bowen. Earlier made a chance for Antonio. Never stopped running. Michail Antonio 7 Hold up play with feet, chest and head was excellent and repeatedly stretched Lyon on the counter. But was a fraction slow the pull the trigger after being put through by Fornals, allowing the defender to block, and did not connect with Bowen’s cross when he might have shot. Subs Ben Johnson (Benrahma 46’) 6 Had no chances to get forward but put in a disciplined and composed display as an auxiliary left-back.
