Digne had to be substituted with ten minutes to play of the 4-0 defeat to Spurs at Villa Park with a collarbone injury. Ashley Young came on for the Frenchman, who had to leave his second game in three for Villa with an injury having picked up a hamstring problem against West Ham United earlier last month. It is more rotten luck for Digne, who had been an ever present for Villa since a £25 million move from Everton up until six games ago. Digne had impressed since his move from Goodison Park in mid-January, playing every minute of his side's half-a-dozen matches after signing for Steven Gerrard's side.

Gerrard reckons that Digne's season is probably over with only seven games left of Villa's campaign to go. ""I'm concerned and worried about it because he's in a sling right now,"" Gerrard said. ""We've got a collarbone issue rather than a shoulder issue. If it's what we fear, it could be season over."" ""It stings right now and, to lose a really important player, a player who we missed last week when he went off. ""So, yeah, we'll analyse it in the next 24 hours in terms of scans and we'll have a medical report on it but the doctors have said they are worried and concerned and that tells you the story."" Digne has taken to social media platform Instagram to share a picture of him in what appears to be a waiting room with his left arm in a sling. He captioned the picture with an emoji of a man with his hand over his head. Villa and Gerrard have high hopes for Digne, who was brought in to provide competition for Matt Targett with the former Southampton man eventually deciding to leave on loan for Newcastle United. Digne has made ten appearances in total for Villa. ",positive,liverpool,0

Villa had a hatful of chances in the first half but did not put them away and the quality of Antonio Conte's Spurs told with Son Heung-min grabbing a hat-trick and Dejan Kulusevski also on the scoresheet. Steven Gerrard 's Villa have not won a game since March 10, when they beat Leeds United 3-0 at Elland Road. That game capped off a three-match winning run but the loss to Spurs means Villa have now won only three times since the end of January.

I repeat we didn't play with a team (that is) no good, we played against Villa in this stadium, it's not easy for anyone to win here. It was a great win for us, it wasn't easy."" And Tottenham fans agreed with him, one writing on social media: ""Credit to Villa for that first half, but that said there was no way they could do that for 90 minutes."" ""It was the weirdest 4-0 I’ve ever seen, because Villa were a good side and are well coached but we were just too clinical when it mattered,"" another added. ""Earlier in the season, with that Villa dominance, we would have lost heavily,"" said a third fan while another added: ""Despite the score this was a tough game, Villa are a good and energetic team.""

Even sweeter for Davis was that his goal came in a 2-0 win for Forest at the City Ground against his parent club's hated rivals Birmingham City. Davis was so clinical in front of goal after only five minutes of the Championship clash to lift Steve Cooper's side up to third place with Scott McKenna also on the scoresheet. Davis netted in front of Blues fans, who were less than pleased to see him celebrate in front of them and remind them of his allegiances. It's now five goals in 18 appearances for Davis, whose Forest have now won their last five games and are only six points behind AFC Bournemouth in second place and they have to play Scott Parker's side next month.

Villa fans were delighted to see Davis net against their old foes and so were team-mates past and present. Davis took to social media platform Instagram to share his reaction to his followers, uploading pictures of him in action during the game. Among those to comment were former Villa striker Rushian Hepburn-Murphy, who wrote: 'My boy'. Villa midfielder Carney Chukwuemeka said 'keep showing them' while former B6 hero Jack Grealish said 'love to see it ma boy scoring against them'. Grealish knows the feeling, with his last appearance for Villa against Blues before moving to Manchester City in August last year coming in a March 2019 success at St Andrew's when he scored in a 1-0 win.

Sawyers is currently on loan at Stoke City, who beat West Brom 3-1 in Saturday's Championship encounter at the Hawthorns. The midfielder, who arrived from Brentford in 2019, is in the final months of his current contract, though Albion are understood to hold an option to extend the deal by a further 12 months. The 30-year-old was not allowed to feature against his parent club on Saturday under the terms of his loan deal. Bruce has, however, left the door open for the player once his stay at the bet365 Stadium comes to an end.

Bruce also revealed he is an admirer of Sawyers before the match against the Potters. ""I’ve always liked him as a player,"" he added. ""He is in my thoughts. I’ll sit down with him in the summer.

The Blues keeper was carried off on a stretcher after a coming together with Djed Spence 60 minutes into the 2-0 defeat at the City Ground. Etheridge was knocked unconscious in the collision and taken to the Queen's Medical Centre hospital in Nottingham for a computerized tomography (CT) scan as the game continued. Blues say that scans ""revealed no injury to the bones in the head but considerable swelling to the right side of the face which took the full force of the impact"". Having been cleared to return home later in the evening, Etheridge must now undergo the FA's six-stage concussion protocol schedule before returning to the squad - meaning he will likely be ineligible to play the Sky Blues on Friday afternoon. READ MORE: Neil Etheridge injury latest as Birmingham City confirm goalkeeper's status READ MORE: Neil Etheridge shares update after Birmingham City injury in Nottingham Forest defeat The guidelines stress that the timescales set out are the absolute minimum requirements and that care must be taken at every stage, but in a best-case scenario, Etheridge's recovery plan would be as follows: Stage 1: Sunday – 24 hours’ minimum rest period after which the player must be symptom-free before progressing. A doctor’s clearance is then recommended before moving on to stage 2. Stage 2: Monday at earliest – Light exercise. This includes ‘walking, light jogging, swimming, stationary cycling or equivalent’ Stage 3: Tuesday at earliest – Football-specific exercise, including simple running drills with limited body and head movement. No heading of the ball is allowed at this stage. Stage 4: Wednesday at earliest – Non-contact training, including ‘passing, change of direction, shooting and small-sided games’ as well as resistance training – but still no heading. Etheridge would again need clearance from a doctor to move onto the next stage. Stage 5: Thursday at earliest – Full-contact practice. This is normal training and may at this point include tackling and heading. Stage 6: Friday at earliest - Player permitted to return to full-match action. Should Etheridge pass each stage of the return to action plan without any issues, then he could be in line to feature against Sky Blues on Friday afternoon; however, if any symptoms occur, the player must have a minimum of 24 hours’ rest without symptoms before they are then able to try to return to training again one stage back from their previous attempt. Connal Trueman was the man called upon as a substitute replacement for Etheridge when he was carried off and the back-up shot-stopper will likely be called upon again if Blues' No.1 has to sit out the visit of Coventry City.

His current deal at Villa expires in 2024 and an offer in the region of £10million could be enough for Villa to part ways with the player, as his first team opportunities look extremely limited in claret and blue given the fact Ollie Watkins, Danny Ings and Cameron Archer all sit ahead of him currently.

Davis, 24, has impressed whilst out on loan in the Championship with five goals and two assists to his name in just 13 starts so far and has already commented on the prospect of signing for the Reds on a permanent deal in the future. Where he stated: ""Yeah, of course. This is the best I’ve played and the most I’ve enjoyed my football in my whole entire life, so it’s just great to be here. “Obviously the manager is a big part of it, but the dressing room has also got the right balance of older and young players - like Cookie (Steve Cook), and then young players like myself, Djed (Spence) and Brennan (Johnson). “It’s just a great mixture. And then the manager lets us express ourselves and be ourselves. We have a bit of banter about that, about loving it here. For me to get my opportunity to be able to express myself and play good, especially for a team like this, is just more than I could ask for.” READ MORE: Aston Villa player ratings vs Tottenham: Ezri Konsa endures shocker as Son Heung-Min bags treble READ MORE: 'Could be over' - Steven Gerrard provides worrying Lucas Digne injury update His performance against Villa's Second City rivals yesterday perfectly outlined why Forest would be so keen to bring him on board permanently, after he recorded three shots on target, eight successful duels, five completed dribbles and opened the scoring. Davis was dominant throughout, which has always been the case in his style of play. One criticism fans have had in the past is that he lacks a prowess in front of goal, however with the confidence regular game time is giving him, Davis seems to be developing into a complete centre forward in the Championship. BirminghamLive'sAshley Preece did provide fans with an update on Davis' future at the club recently. Where he stated: "" Steven Gerrard had a good look at Davis after he arrived in November. ""The feeling at Villa is that Davis is surplus to requirements. He'll have two years on his contract when pre-season begins in July and there's every hope Villa will be able to make a decent profit on the 24-year-old. His form for the Reds is great news for Villa. There will be clubs queuing up to take him, for sure. ""But, in a nutshell, it's believed Davis' Villa future is done. He's loved it at the City Ground and it's really rejuvenated his career. In terms of a deal, I think a fee between £5m and £10m would be the ballpark figure Villa would be looking for. Strikers cost money and Davis has proved himself to be a good one in Nottingham."" Davis' goal against Villa's local rivals is another huge boost for Villa's transfer stance on the player ahead of the summer transfer window. If Davis continues this form and Forest do achieve promotion to the Premier League, they will be eager to sign the player permanently - in the same way Villa did with Tyrone Mings upon promotion for around £26million. If Villa were to get even half of that fee for Davis, it could provide them with a boost in terms of their transfer business throughout the rest of the window. ",positive,liverpool,0

Villa were looking the more likely side to score in the first half after going 1-0 down, as they forced Hugo Lloris into several key saves to deny the likes of Danny Ings, Matty Cash, Jacob Ramsey and John McGinn in the first 45 minutes. Despite an impressive first half, Villa's hopes of getting back into the game were quickly squashed following the restart. Dejan Kulusevski calmly slotted his effort home from a tight angle in the 53rd and the game quickly slipped away from Steven Gerrard's men following this, as they found themselves 4-0 down by the 70th minute. Speaking on BBC's Match of the Day, Murphy outlined the change Conte made at half time by stating: ""I think at half time the manager [Antonio Conte] used some clever words, some harsh words and changed it a little bit tactically.

""Good organisation, kept winning the ball back high up the pitch, which is obviously what they set out to do and they kept making chances this way. For some strange reason the decision making Tottenham player just kept trying to do it. They just kept on giving the ball back to Villa. ""Like any good manager would, he's had a word with them at half time, Kane then uses his physical presence and then [Dejan] Kulusevski, what a finish. That was the difference, they missed the press out, they didn't let Villa on to them and those long balls killed the game.""

Trincao is on a season-long loan at Wolves from Barcelona and there has been some talk of the move being made permanent in the summer. However, reports emerging from Portugal claim that the player is ""not satisfied"" with life at the Molineux and does not see his future there. According to O Jogo (via Sports Witness ), the winger is becoming disgruntled at Wolves and could look to pursue a move back to Portugal after links to Sporting Lisbon recently emerged.

Barcelona boss Xavi has no intentions of including Trincao in his long term plans but the club will 'insist' on including him in a swap deal for the Traore, if this occurs. However, the report also states that the La Liga giants would be willing to negotiate a move elsewhere for Trincao, whether that is a loan or permanently.

It will be another busy transfer window for Villa this summer, as Gerrard prepares for his first full pre season in charge of the club. Gerrard will once again be backed heavily by the Villa owners, who already funded moves for Lucas Digne and Philippe Coutinho in January. Ahead of the window, Villa have reportedly identified their top two targets for the window, as Gerrard looks to address the issues amongst the squad that are plaguing his progress currently. According to The Mirror, Brighton's Yves Bissouma and Joe Gomez are the 'top targets' for Gerrard this summer, as the Liverpool legend looks set to test his former club with a pursuit of the English defender whilst also renewing his interest in Bissouma. READ MORE: Aston Villa player ratings vs Tottenham: Ezri Konsa endures shocker as Son Heung-Min bags treble READ MORE: 'Could be over' - Steven Gerrard provides worrying Lucas Digne injury update Villa saw a bid rejected for Bissouma in January with Gerrard confirming the rumours by stating: ""I’m delighted with the support from the board. It was well documented that we put in a bid for Bissouma at Brighton which was turned away, and we respected and appreciated. If a move is not right then we will not become desperate and make a decisions that we do not think is right. If it’s not right at the time we might have to be patient in a few situations.” Villa will be looking to add a centre half and a dominant defensive midfielder to solidify the defence that shipped four goals to Tottenham. Aside from this, Gerrard could also pursue a move for a 'genuine A-list striker' after witnessing his side lack a clear clinical edge in front of goal in the first half of the 4-0 loss to Antonio Conte's side. Gerrard has had several months in charge of the club now where he will have identified areas of improvement the squad needs. Speaking on his transfer plans for summer, he recently stated: """"I don't think there will be any youngsters or potential coming in, in the short term, because it's clear to me since walking through the door with our run of fixtures that we need players who are ready to help us now."" ""At a club that's been inconsistent for a long time, when you recruit, a big part of that has to be leadership. It's not just about adding talent and adding talent.

Keinan Davis, on-loan from Aston Villa, gave the home side the lead after just five minutes as he drove home from a tight angle. Blues had chances to score before and after half-time but were unable to find a way past Brice Samba. Lee Bowyer was forced into an early change when Neil Etheridge had to be carried off on a stretcher after colliding with Djed Spence outside the penalty area; Connal Trueman replaced him between the posts. Scott McKenna doubled the Reds' lead shortly before full-time. These are some Blues talking points that you may have missed... READ MORE: Birmingham City player ratings vs Nottingham Forest as Blues beaten and Etheridge injured READ MORE: Why Birmingham City made four subs in Nottingham Forest defeat WRITING ON THE WALL THANKS TO UNWANTED RECORDS Bowyer knew what to expect when he took his team to the City Ground having witnessed Forest's 2-0 win over Coventry City just a few days earlier. Ahead of the match he spoke of how his team would need to match Steve Cooper's ""physically"" and that set-pieces would be a dangerous part of Forest's attacking play. But the writing was on the wall almost immediately for Blues when Davis opened the scoring after just five minutes. A rapid counter-attack saw Philip Zinckernagel steal the ball from Gary Gardner before sliding Davis down the left channel; the on-loan Villa striker's pace and power out wide allowed him to breeze past Nico Gordon before driving low and hard past Etheridge. Once that goal went in the task of frustrating Forest became even more hard. The City Ground has proven to be a difficult hunting ground for Blues in recent years - they are winless in six attempts - but even more concerning is Blues' record when falling behind. Blues have picked up just four points from being a goal down with four draws - against Barnsley (1-1), Peterborough (2-2), Preston (1-1) and Stoke City (2-2) It is not perhaps for a lack of effort - Ivan Sunjic, Kristian Pedersen, Nico Gordon and Taylor Richards all had chances - but more of a lack in quality once in the real third. “If you take the goal away from Forest, I thought we were the better side in the first half,"" said Bowyer. ""I felt we asked a lot of questions of them but we lacked that little bit of quality. That was the difference on the day. “I thought there wasn’t much between us during the second half. Once they got the second goal that was it, game over, but until that I thought we kept pushing. My players kept trying but the differences between the two boxes was that they had more quality than we did. That’s how you win games.” DEENEY RETURNS It has been a long time coming for Troy Deeney with regards to him making his Blues comeback. The 33-year-old - who is set to be the subject of a new Channel 4 documentary - had not been included in a matchday squad since January 8 when he was named in the 18-man squad at Forest by Bowyer. His last appearance was in the 1-0 extra-time defeat to Plymouth in the FA Cup three months ago. He initially picked up a thigh injury against the Pilgrims but had his return extended further due to a calf strain. Deeney came on to replace Scott Hogan on 82 minutes but enjoyed a 20-minute cameo appearance in the end after 12 minutes of injury time were added at the end of the second half. It is clear to see that Deeney is not quite at his best, understandably so given he has been out of the matchday squad for 91 days. The experienced forward lacked in match sharpness and had slow reactions to the occasional loose ball in and around the Forest penalty area. His physicality provided an edge against the hosts' strong back three of Joe Worrall, Tobias Figuieredo and Scott McKenna, but ultimately they stood firm and denied Deeney from making anything count. FOOTBALL COMMUNITY COMES TOGETHER TO WISH ETHERIDGE WELL It is always a concern when a player goes down injured, but it was even more worrying when Etheridge and Djed Spence collided outside the penalty area on the hour-mark. Both players were desperate to reach a loose ball but ended up in a heap with Etheridge clearly coming off the worse. ""It was a collision between two players going at full speed,"" said Bowyer at full-time. ""He came off with concussion, he was out cold the whole time he was being treated and he's now been taken to hospital. We're waiting to hear some good news. ""Part of Spence's body connected with Neil's head and it meant he was out cold. It was just a coming together between two committed players going for the ball. ""There was no malicious intent in it at all. It's just one of those where two players have come together and they happen from time to time."" He added: ""The worrying thing for me was that at one point he wasn't moving at all. There was no movement, a lot of arms being waved around so it was quite worrying. ""He's in the hospital now though. I'm hoping he has come around now - I've not heard yet - but we're waiting for some good news."" Having received treatment for almost 10 minutes, fans from both sides put their tribal loyalties aside for one moment as the importance of an individual's health and wellbeing stood paramount as they applauded Etheridge down the tunnel. That sentiment continued after full-time as Forest and Blues fans sent their best wishes to the Enfield-born goalkeeper on social media. What did you make of Blues' performance vs Forest?

Villa recorded more shots on target, more possession and a higher expected goals value than Antonio Conte's side but sadly were beaten on the statistic that matters the most, the final score. A scoreline of 4-0 may flatter Spurs in this fixture but this shouldn't stray away from the fact that much like the end of this season, the game slipped away from Steven Gerrard's team in this fixture. The game itself mirrored a performance from earlier on in the season, which saw Dean Smith's Villa side lose 3-0 to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Villa fell behind early in this fixture thanks to Romelu Lukaku's effort in the 15th minute, but looked as if they could still take something from the game. However, an early goal from Mateo Kovacic just after half time destroyed all hopes of a comeback and the performance fell off after this. Dejan Kulusevski's effort from a tight angle just after the break had a similar impact yesterday. A defiant Villa side came out after the half time break attacking the Holte End and seemingly had the momentum in their favour. Following the second goal in the 53rd minute, all hopes of result dispersed and so did the crowd shortly after Villa fell four nil down just 18 minutes later.

After the South Korea striker steered the visitors into an early lead, Spurs withstood a Villa onslaught to remain ahead at the interval with veteran goalkeeper Hugo Lloris making a string of superb saves. But they cruised to victory with a breathtaking, counter-attacking second-half performance as Son swept home two more fine finishes, either side of an equally elegant strike from Dejan Kulusevski. Read more here. The Guardian Antonio Conte praised Tottenham’s improving mentality as Son Heung-min’s hat-trick enabled his team to capitalise on their rivals’ defeats to move three points clear of Arsenal in the contest to qualify for the Champions League. Remarkably, after Son’s third-minute opener, Villa were the stronger side, until Dejan Kulusevski made it 2-0 in the sixth minute of the second half. Then Villa fell apart. Steven Gerrard’s pre-match message that he would be re-evaluating the captaincy in the summer obviously did nothing to inspire Tyrone Mings and co who fell to a fourth successive defeat. As a measure of how forceful Villa were in the first half, Hugo Lloris had to make the joint-most saves he has made in a single half of a Premier League match to keep out the best Danny Ings, Ollie Watkins and Philippe Coutinho could throw at him. Villa, aggressive in the extreme, had 14 efforts on goal in this period. Overall, their expected goals tally was 1.7 compared with Spurs’ somewhat bizarre XG of one. Read more here. Sky Sports Heung-Min Son’s hat-trick took Tottenham three points clear of Arsenal in the race for fourth with a clinical 4-0 win away to Aston Villa. Goals early in each half from Son and Dejan Kulusevski put Antonio Conte's team in control, before the hat-trick hero added two more on the break to seal an emphatic victory. Villa had plenty of chances in the first half as they peppered Hugo Lloris' goal with shots but, roared on by their fans, they could not take any of their opportunities. It was the difference. Read more here. Daily Mail All of Conte's big-hitters were in sensational form, none more so than hat-trick hero Son Heung-min, who now has six in three games, and skipper Hugo Lloris, who made seven key stops before half-time. January signing Dejan Kulusevski got a goal and an assist. Harry Kane wasn't on the scoresheet but played a part in three of the goals. No wonder the travelling fans chanted 'Ant-on-io, Ant-on-io' without break. Even at 4-0, Conte was his normal hyperactive self in the technical area. Read more here. ",positive,liverpool,0

Wolves are eighth after a 1-0 defeat at Newcastle United on Friday night. And after Manchester United and Arsenal both lost on Saturday, Son Heung-min’s sensational hat-trick and a fine Dejan Kulusevski strike earned a 4-0 win against Aston Villa that sent Spurs three points in clear in fourth. It could not have been a bigger statement from Conte’s side and they will now be favourites to finish the job, having won six of their last seven Premier League games. “It was a great win for us, it wasn’t easy. But a great win, especially when you play a game after the games of your rivals in the race for the Champions League and they lost,” the Italian said. READ: Bruno Lage explains what officials told him about Newcastle penalty call READ: Wolves player ratings after Chris Wood penalty hands Newcastle victory “Wolves, Manchester United and Arsenal. We had to show in this moment that you start to feel the blood of your opponent and it is important to not fail. For this reason we are working a lot on the mentality. The players are giving me great satisfaction in many aspects. “I said this before Arsenal, United and then Wolves and West Ham are with us in the same race for a place in the Champions League. To know that your opponent lose their games, and for sure they have to give you the right desire, the right will to get three points because in one hand you know our rivals lose the game if we lose, but we are always in the fourth place. “A little medium team can think this. A top, strong team think that it is the right moment to improve the distance over your rivals and exploit this situation. We did this despite the difficulty of the game. I repeat we didn’t play with a team (that is) no good, we played against Aston Villa in this stadium, it’s not easy for anyone to win here.” Despite the scoreline Spurs did not have it all their own way and could have been out of the game at half-time had it not been for Hugo Lloris in the Spurs goal. After Son’s early opener, Villa were all over Tottenham and had 14 shots, with the Frenchman saving seven of them. Tottenham’s deadly front three showed their killer instinct after the break as Son completed his treble and Kulusevski also bagged. Villa boss Steven Gerrard, whose side have now lost four games in a row, said the first-half performance was the best of his tenure. “First half… best performance we have had together in the first 45 minutes,” he said. “I can’t remember many times through my football career where I have been so proud and happy going off a pitch 1-0 (down). In terms of what you were asking the players to go and do on the pitch, I thought we were dominant, we were aggressive, we suffocated Tottenham, I thought we created enough chances to win more than one football match, but we didn’t execute. “I was scratching my head going off how we we were losing that game 1-0. I thought the second goal was a real blow for us. It was real quality from Tottenham’s point of view, but defensively it is extremely poor. The third and fourth goals were no better on the eye. “They made it about our backline in the second half, they were ruthless with their quality and that’s the reason the scoreline is what it was. They are certainly high-level players. I would say two of them are world class and the young kid from Juventus Kulusevski is potentially a top player. “That is my opinion on it. You have to remember Man City, Liverpool, Chelsea have world-class players as well.

That's never a good mix if you're on the receiving end of it with Spurs making it four defeats on the spin for Steven Gerrard's wounded Aston Villa side. Long, lofted balls upto Spurs' deadly duo of Harry Kane and hat-trick hero Son Heung-Min - Premier League record holders having combined for 40 goals - did the trick with Ezri Konsa and Tyrone Mings struggling to contain them as the goals kept flying in. As we all seen, Villa put in a real strong offering in that first half but missed chances cost them dearly. BirminghamLive's Villa correspondent Ashley Preece picks out the big talking points with Villa forced to lick their wounds for another 13 days before travelling to Leicester City on St George's Day. READ MORE: Aston Villa player ratings vs Tottenham: Ezri Konsa endures shocker as Son Heung-Min bags treble READ MORE: 'Could be over' - Steven Gerrard provides worrying Lucas Digne injury update GERRARD TARGETING NEW NO.9 AS MISSED CHANCES PROVE COSTLY We'll start with the good and, at long lost, we all witnessed it. We witnessed what Gerrard's trying to achieve in B6 with Villa really strangling Tottenham for large parts of that first 45. Villa thundered into challenges, roughed up those in Lilywhite and created some clear-cut chances that were painstakingly missed. This was the 'all-in' Villa Gerrard promised and wants to see week in, week out but, again, it was yet another 45-minute performance. In fairness, Hugo Lloris was like a man possessed last night and that save to deny a Jacob Ramsey equaliser deserves the pick for save of the season. However, two huge chances fell to Villa's strikers, Danny Ings and Ollie Watkins. Had Villa had Son and Kane up front then that first-half could have probably been six or seven-nil to the home side. Back to reality, though, and Villa's front two are struggling in front of goal. Watkins missed two good chances last week at Wolves while, for Ings, his confidence has taken a hit, evident when he scuffed THAT chance he had to make it 1-1. There's no real options on the bench to come in and play as an out-and-out No.9 while, on Friday, Gerrard detailed how he wants to bring in more options up front when the summer transfer window comes around. ""I want more forward options in the No.9 position,"" he declared, when discussing Cameron Archer's exploits at Preston. The 20-year-old scored yet again yesterday to take his tally to seven in 15 games. He just cannot stop scoring, the kid, which is ironic given Villa's shortcomings in attack at present. On Watkins and Ings' form, Gerrard said: ""We'll stay with them. It's a problem when you're a manager when you're not creating (chances). As a team, we need to keep creating and have belief that Danny and Ollie will take them. Leon (Bailey) came in and could have passed one into the bottom corner late on. ""We work on our finishing and forward play most days, if not all week. All we can do is keep working with what we've got and have the trust and belief that the players will execute them chances. We created chances in that first half to certainly win two or three football matches."" As well as the blatantly-obvious addition of a new defensive midfielder, a red-hot No.9 is also high on this summer's wish-list with soon-to-be free agent Luis Suarez - 11 goals from his 17 starts this season - previously mooted. KONSA BULLIED BY KANE AS CENTRE-BACK SHAKE-UP REQUIRED Gerrard was bang on with regards to winning a not one but a couple matches given the chances that were spurned. Even my Tottenham colleagues outlined that Villa should have been out of sight but, one thing you cannot get away from was the defending with Ezri Konsa particularly poor last night. Konsa was too soft up against Kane and Son and allowed the former to bully him. It's also hard to comprehend that, for all but Lucas Digne at left-back, Villa had a backline in place that chalked up a joint club-record 15 clean sheets last season. The boss pointed to Dejan Kulusevski's goal five minutes after the break as the killer, and said: ""That one was a real blow for us. Defensively, from our point of view, it's extremely poor to allow someone that amount of time and space to get a shot off in your box. It's poor. The third and fourth goals were no better on the eye, either. They made it about our backline in the second half. They were ruthless with quality and that's the reason why the scoreline was what it was."" Both Konsa and Mings have been shaky this season. Calum Chambers will surely get another look-in now by the time Leicester comes around while, in the summer, it's another area of interest to recruit with experienced leaders the remit for Gerrard and Villa's transfer chiefs. A STALE LOOK TO THE VILLA'S SYSTEM AND STARTING XI It was back to type for Gerrard last night, reverting to his favoured 4-3-1-2 system with Ings and Watkins leading the line. There were no real shocks to the starting XI, either, with Morgan Sanson and Leon Bailey both dropping out after their rare outings last week. However, the system Gerrard is intent on has flaws at present which Tottenham, Wolves, Arsenal and West Ham have all exposed within the last month. Jacob Ramsey - arguably in need of a rest - and John McGinn are often tasked with providing a little bit of width as the full-backs bomb forward, which leaves huge gaps in and around Douglas Luiz and the middle of the park, an area Tottenham really exploited on Saturday. Could we see Gerrard have a look at another system with just seven games to go? It remains to be seen but it's certainly an option - especially with Marvelous Nakamba now back available. The Zimbabwean could really help Villa as they look to arrest this alarming slide. Bertrand Traore and Carney Chukwuemeka were unused yesterday - could they be granted some more game time? READ MORE: 'Woeful, dire' - Furious Aston Villa fans not holding back after Tottenham hammering READ MORE: Tottenham boss Antonio Conte gives Aston Villa verdict after Son Heung-min hat-trick Whatever happens from now until the season concludes one thing is evidently clear and Villa's first-team squad will look a whole lot different to what it does now when the new 22/23 season begins in August. The owners, Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens, could well take their transfer kitty spend to a staggering £500million in less than four years. A huge summer of change awaits. COUTINHO SHOWED FLASHES AS VILLA PARK CROWD BOUNCE OFF PLAYERS As always I like to wrap things up with a dollop of positivity. I thought Philippe Coutinho finally showed glimpses of his best last night after a run of no-shows. The Brazilian really tormented Tottenham in that first-half and was so unlucky not to equalise in stoppage time with that near-post free-kick. Coutinho put chances on a plate for his peers as well, who all lifted their performances alongside him within that opening 45. The Villa crowd yesterday were right behind the players as well - up until Son made it a little too embarrassing. The fans roared and applauded the players off at half-time with both - the supporters and players - really bouncing off each other. ""Much, much better from Villa,"" I tweeted as Ramsey and Mings pole-axed Tottenham players. ""Really fighting with Spurs - Jacob Ramsey just flies into another challenge. This is what it should be like every week. This is what we want to see."" The trick now is to sustain that type of tempo and pressure which Gerrard alluded to in his post-match presser. Gerrard's counterpart Antonio Conte, meanwhile, knows what Villa Park can be like, and said: ""Today the first half was difficult, but we knew this because when you play against Aston Villa away in this stadium, this fantastic atmosphere, I don't think there is one team that comes here and wins easy."" Villa's home form needs improving, though, with just five wins from 15 all season while, under Gerrard, it's three wins from 10. Villa host Norwich, Burnley, Palace and Liverpool to improve their record in B6 before the campaign's out. Villa won seven from 19 at home last term. Gerrard's message to supporters was this last night: ""Listen, in terms of the scoreline I'd like to apologise but, the supporters inside the stadium today would have seen a game of two halves. We'll work extremely hard to bounce back from this, of course we will. If the players feel the same way as I do now, I'm really confident that we'll get the reaction we need.""

READ MORE HERE Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher believes the way in which Wolves ""allowed Newcastle to win the ball easily back off them"" was their downfall in the first half at St James' Park. While it may have still been a stalemate at half-time between the two sides, Newcastle could've easily gone in front after centre-forward Chris Wood had a goal disallowed for an offside in the build-up. Despite possession being even, Bruno Lage 's side managed just a single shot compared to the hosts' five, four of which were blocked. Newcastle also had 10 times as many dangerous attacks (20 to Wolves' two), although neither goalkeeper was forced into a save that counted. That didn't stop the long-time Liverpool defender from holding back in an assessment of Wolves' first 45. ""They have been so poor,"" Carragher said on Sky Sports' Friday Night Football at half-time. ""They have allowed Newcastle to win the ball easily back off them, get the crowd back on their side.

The hosts and Wood had previously had the ball in the back of the net inside the opening half-hour, but the goal was disallowed by the video assistant referee for an offside in the build-up. The win sees Newcastle move 10 points clear of the relegation zone into 14th place, albeit with multiple games in hand for Burnley and Everton below them. The long-time Bournemouth manager has since stressed the importance of securing the three points against Wolves. ""It feels like a big win for us,"" Howe told  ChronicleLive  .  ""Off the back of the three defeats that we had away from home, we knew we had to respond, especially with the second half against Tottenham (Hotspur).

But they were not able to nullify a Chris Wood penalty in the second half. Bruno Lage's side remain eighth on 49 points with six games left until the end of the season. Kilman who was present in defence in the defeat against the Magpies admitted post-match : ""It’s very tough.

A sloppy start from Blues allowed Keinan Davis, on-loan from Aston Villa, to drive home an opening goal on five minutes from a tight angle. The visitors were limited to efforts from distance for the majority of the game but came closest when Kristian Pedersen's pull-back trickled across the six-yard box needing a simple touch to score. Lee Bowyer was forced into a concussion change midway through the second-half when Neil Etheridge collided with Djed Spence outside the penalty area; and the change in 'keeper resulted in a further blow for Blues as Connal Trueman failed to stop Scott McKenna from doubling the hosts' lead from close range. READ MORE: Birmingham City player ratings vs Nottingham Forest as Blues beaten and Etheridge injured READ MORE: Why Birmingham City made four subs in Nottingham Forest defeat It means Blues' poor run at the City Ground - a run stretching back to December 2014 - continues.

Johnson squandered a great chance when James Garner's quickly taken corner fell to his feet at the penalty area; ironic cheers from the large Blues travelling contingency provided a backdrop as the 20-year-old blazed over the crossbar. It took until 30 minutes had been played before Lee Bowyer's side began to show some attacking potential.

What Lee Bowyer said Speaking after the game, Bowyer said he felt the game had been evenly-poised between the two sides and that they could have taken more from the game if they had better accuracy when in-front of goal. ""If you take the goal away from Forest, I thought we were the better side in the first half – I felt we asked a lot of questions of them but we lacked that little bit of quality. That was the difference on the day. ""I thought there wasn’t much between us during the second half. Once they got the second goal that was it, game over, but until that I thought we kept pushing. My players kept trying but the differences between the two boxes was that they had more quality than we did. That’s how you win games.""

He came off with concussion, he was out cold the whole time he was being treated and he's now been taken to hospital. We're waiting to hear some good news. ""Part of Spence's body connected with Neil's head and it meant he was out cold. It was just a coming together between two committed players going for the ball. ""There was no malicious intent in it at all. It's just one of those where two players have come together and they happen from time to time. ""The worrying thing for me was that at one point he wasn't moving at all. There was no movement, a lot of arms being waved around so it was quite worrying. ""He's in the hospital now though. I'm hoping he has come around now - I've not heard yet - but we're waiting for some good news."" What Steve Cooper said ""That’s the first time the club has won three games on the bounce after an international break. ""That’s good. And it was a challenge I set to the players before the game, asking if we could do that. I think we’ve been good for it throughout the week. And I think we were good for it today. ""I felt we could have capitalised on it a bit more in the first half. From the goal until half-time, we’ve played better than that this year. But I get it, it was the third game in a week.

Jacko: ""Surprised with how conservative/cautious we were in our selection Bela & Graham should have started imo with Deeney Hogan had no support Woods instead of Sunjic too."" Up next Blues will host Midlands neighbours Coventry City on Friday, April 14 for a 3pm kick-off. Bowyer's men will then return to action the following Monday, away at Blackpool (April 18).

21,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-tottenham-gerrard-norwich-23649338,Steven Gerrard responsible for 'woeful' Aston Villa defeat as Dean Smith reunion looms,"Match report Son Heung-Min was the hat-trick hero for Tottenham as Aston Villa were punished in ruthless fashion on an embarrassing evening at Villa Park. Prior to kick-off and, off the back of last week's sorry showing at Molineux, Steven Gerrard called on his players to put in a full 90-minute performance but, yet again, Villa were only good for 45 with Son's treble and Dejan Kulusevski doing all the damage to make it four defeats on the spin for the hosts. It was a sloppy goal that gifted Antonio Conte's men the one-goal advantage after just three minutes. England defender Eric Dier flighted a hopeful ball upto Son, Ezri Konsa jumped for the ball far too early and Harry Kane gobbled up the loose ball. The Spurs striker's effort then nicked off Matty Cash before Son pounced to strike brilliantly in off the post for his 15th Premier League goal of the season. In stark contrast to last week at Wolves, it was Villa who then came roaring back, helped by a couple of crunching challenges put in by Tyrone Mings and Jacob Ramsey which really lifted the sell-out crowd in B6. Read Ash Preece's full match report and player ratings here What Steven Gerrard said ""It's tough. The scoreline is harsh on us, but it's the reality and we have to accept that. I have to accept it - I'm responsible. The story of the game certainly wasn't a 4-0 game,"" he said. ""It's the first time in football I've gone off at half-time 1-0 down and been really happy and proud, we were magnificent, we didn't take our chances but at half-time I said if we can continue this I have no doubt we get back into the game. The second half it flipped, Spurs' quality players made it about our backline and they punished us really heavily. ""Analysing the first goal, a long straight ball we could've defended that better, they got a bit of luck but they're ruthless in front of goal. To be 1-0 down at half-time was against the run of play, we were outstanding and the chances we've created against a top side is enough to win two or three games. ""We asked them to maintain that at half-time and we tried, we talk about defending the area around 18-yard box and Spurs punished us heavily in that area. ""We've got time - I don't know if that's a good thing, you want the next game quickly after a defeat like that which stings but I've got to pick the players up and be ready for the next game. I want us to remember that first half, we have a lot to learn and defensively in the second half we have even more to learn."" What Antonio Conte said ""We know the difficulty of playing Villa away, this stadium had a great atmosphere and I want to thank our fans because they were not in the same number but they pushed us from the start to the end - so to give them this type of satisfaction is great for us. ""We work to improve the players but also to make our fans satisfied about their team and that happened today. We are pleased - not an easy game but we showed resilience in the first half when Villa tried to push a lot and put a lot of pressure on us. Every time we tried to play the ball and have a chance we did score. ""To be resilient is important if we want to be a top team, in every game there are moments when the opponent can create difficulty and if we are not strong you will never win something or do something important. We are going in this aspect, I'm very happy because I have a group of players who want to show me that they will improve in many aspects. ""When you have this you have to be happy to work with them and to try to do something important at the end of the season. Seven games to go and we are showing that we are deserving to stay in the race for a place in the Champions League."" What the fans said @cljd73 : Passing, defending, finishing all dire. @AVFCFaithful_ : Playing so narrow against a team that plays so wide is suicide. @philg1987 : The Buendia and Bailey subs have left me absolutely raging if I'm honest. THIS FORMATION DOES NOT WORK! Their fourth goal Digne was on the halfway line and that caused the middle to disappear because we had to cover. JOKE!!! @ajhilton7 : We know this squad lacks quality overall, there's a big void in their fluidity on and off the ball. It lacks pace across the pitch, but now I'm seriously questioning their mental toughness too. Genuinely don't think the majority of them want it enough. Big clear out needed! @ingram1964 : I don’t care what SG has to say for himself but I’d rather him show his worth and put out a team for the next game with wholesale changes! @VillasJess : Can only say fair play to Spurs and especially Son and Lloris. Only two players who turned up for Spurs in the first half and kept them in the game. Top top players. Can only dream of quality like that at Villa. W4 D2 L9 since Christmas for Villa. Woeful. @Villaboy89 : Top half is still on, but on this form, I would take a 11th or 12th place finish and maybe get rid of Lange as Sporting Director and bring in someone who can give us a serious rebuild in terms of recruitment Up next Villa are next in action when they travel to face Leicester City at the King Power Stadium on Saturday, April 23. After that, it is Dean Smith's Norwich at home on April 30 before a trip to relegation-threatened Burnley on May 7. ",positive,liverpool,0
22,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/steve-bruce-demands-overhaul-west-23649273,Steve Bruce demands 'overhaul' as West Brom fall to defeat to Stoke City,"Match report In the space of four days, and two outings at The Hawthorns, West Brom have shown exactly why they’ll be playing in the Championship again next season. Having just swept aside promotion chasing Bournemouth, they followed it up with a grim performance and a comprehensive 3-1 defeat at the hands of fellow under achievers Stoke City. Callum Robinson had pulled a goal back in the second half after a Jake Livermore own goal and then Jacob Brown’s header had handed the Potters control, but Lewis Baker sealed the points for Albion’s Midlands rivals at the death. If you were only informed that one of these sides won in the week while the other was beaten, you’d never have guessed that it was Albion who enjoyed one of their most notable victories of the season three days earlier. They moved the ball painfully slowly in the opening advances, displaying no obvious urgency to get the ball forward quickly. READ: West Brom player ratings v Stoke as 3s and 4s are dished out across the board READ: Bruce fires 'unacceptable' warning ahead of West Brom's summer Jayson Molumby, brought into the starting XI, was busy and energetic while Semi Ajayi did what he could from his centre back berth, but across the pitch too many players seemed to be going through the motions. Stoke were easier on the eye, but they weren’t creating a host of chances themselves so it made for a rather drab opening 45 minutes. Read the full report here. What Steve Bruce said “It’s encapsulated my eight weeks, that’s for sure. It’s a frustration for us all. The goals we gave away, the first two, is something I never saw coming because we’re usually rock solid in that department. ""In the first half we didn’t get going. We passed the ball slowly, we didn’t really have any penetration in the forward areas. It was another frustrating afternoon, and that unfortunately has happened too often. It’s the reason why we are where we are. ""It was the third game in six days, and there were a few who looked jaded. Physically, we put in our best stats of the season on Wednesday against Bournemouth. You’ve got to be able to go again in the Championship, it’s what it demands. It’s Saturday Tuesday Saturday. ""We didn’t look right from the kick off. We were slow in and out of possession, and it was a deeply frustrating afternoon for us. ""We have five or six games left, we’ll never give it up. We have to finish as high as we possibly can. If you’re a genuine supporter and you’ve watched the team this season - we are where we are. ""It’s never going to be accepted at this club in the Championship, and rightly so. It’s not been good enough - after 42 games, it doesn’t lie. ""We have to have a team that’s capable of mounting a challenge to get out of this division and they’re not going to be happy if they see their team in mid-table,” Bruce said. “I go with their thoughts completely and I hope that I can give them a team that can physically handle the Championship and the demands that go with it. ""We have to have the ability to change and we have to bring a fresher, younger look to everything. I’ve only been here for eight weeks and we’re all clamouring for time but of course you learn. We’re verging on a major overhaul. That’s required because the club is never going to accept being halfway in the Championship and rightly so."" What Michael O'Neill said ""We knew what we would face coming here today with the threat of Andy Carroll and we stood up to that. But the pleasing thing for me is that, in particular, I thought in the first half we were terrific – we were great on the ball and some of our play was brilliant. ""We probably should have been more than one ahead at the break. I was also really pleased with how we were after conceding – 2-1 can be edgy and there were a lot of balls coming into our box but we also had two great chances, one of which we took to win the game 3-1. On scoring the first two goals from set-pieces, O'Neill added: ""We work on set-pieces a lot. The first free-kick is something that we worked on with Northern Ireland and it worked a high percentage of the time."" What the fans said Andy Leeman: ""The appointment of Bruce is right up there with the Pardew one. Absolute masterclass."" Christian: ""I don't know how anybody expected anything different tbh."" Devon Baggie: ""Let’s have a clear out. Give it Morrison for the last few games. Blood in a few kids etc again for experience. Next season a younger fresh pair of eyes and more importantly ideas. Somebody the players can relate to or respect more. Rooney, Terry, Barton, Bilic (maybe), Mowbray"" Ant: ""Psychologically a mess, only fight when it’s too late and there’s players who just aren’t good enough dragging down the ones that are. If we have no investment in the summer we will be playing league 1 football. Also get Andy Carroll a new contract because we will need him."" JonW: ""3 shocking goals to concede but Stoke were the only side playing to win. 1st goal should’ve been easy to clear but a poor own goal. 2nd we didn’t even switch on to the free kick. 3rd we turn attack into defence at an alarming rate and Johnstone should’ve been out to the cross."" Will Turner: ""Starting to get beyond a joke. Never going to make progress with players that pick and chose the games they want to turn up in. Serious squad overhaul needed."" Luke Pollard: ""Finish the season."" Moura: ""Bruce out, Lai out, every player out."" JonWill: ""Nevermind, still got manager of the month nomination."" Andi Purewal: ""Absolute shambles. For anyone thinking Bruce is the man for next season, may God help you."" Ryan: ""This team is making me fall out of football."" Jack: ""We are such a strange club."" Up next: Albion will have a third consecutive game at home when they host Blackpool on Friday, April 15 (3pm) before returning to action the following Monday to promotion chasing Nottingham Forest (April 18).
