Man City and Liverpool played out a thrilling draw at the Etihad on Sunday as the race for the Premier League title hots up. Liverpool taking a point off the league leaders angered Gallagher, who produced multiple profanity-filled tweets. The outspoken Man City fan branded Jurgen Klopp's team 'lucky pool' and took aim at match referee Anthony Taylor. On Taylor, he wrote: ""That refs a massive c**t."" Another tweet reads: ""Lucky pool."" Lucky pool Gallagher tweeted: ""Played them of the park dirty c**ts."" Gallagher continued with the 'lucky pool' taunt and reckons his side should have won convincingly after a dominant first-half. ""Should have been 10-2 to city lucky pool FC,"" he tweeted. Should have been 10-2 to city lucky pool FC The Blues remain at the top of the league, one point ahead of Liverpool - with both teams having seven league games left. Speaking after the match, Pep Guardiola told Sky Sports: ""He [Klopp] likes these punching games. It was a fantastic advert for the Premier League. Both teams wanted to win. I had the feeling we left them alive but Liverpool are a joy to watch, I know how good and difficult they are. ""We performed really, really well. I'm so proud of the team. Now we have seven games left and we have to win all of them or it will be over."" The Spaniard added: ""I said before the game it doesn't matter if we win or lose. Of course, it was a massive game but we know what we have to do. Seven games is a lot of games, tough games away - so do they. ""I don't know what is going to happen if we win the Premier League but to be there for the fifth season - and I want to win the Premier League - is so good that is doesn't matter [if we lose the title].""

Loadingâ¦ Ten Hag seems to have jumped ahead of Mauricio Pochettino to become the favourite to take charge at Old Trafford next season, as the club's latest permanent manager. The current Ajax boss is said to have agreed terms with the Premier League side, although there is no official confirmation or compensation agreed with his current club. Ajax even barred English journalists from attending their manager's press conferences earlier this week, to try and cut down on the amount of questions about his potential future job. Now it seems that they could be banning some German journalists too, with Ten Hag having received an offer from the Bundesliga. According to both De Telegraaf and AD, RB Leipzig have sent an 'excellent' multi year offer for the former Bayern Munich II boss to join them. The report also adds that Leipzig, who United's current interim boss Ralf Rangnick used to manage, are ready to pay the â¬2 million compensation that the Dutch side want to allow their manager to leave. United are also ready to meet the asking price, with Pochettino's much higher price one of the reasons he isn't first choice, but Leipzig are clearly active competitors for the manager's signature. Domenico Tedesco took over at Leipzig in November, with the club in the bottom half, after now Leeds United boss Jesse Marsch failed to replace Julian Nagelsmann. The team are now in fourth place in the German top tier and look like they could qualify for next season's Champions League. Clearly they believe that Ten Hag is the right man to take them forward, considering his record in Europe, where he took Ajax to within a minute of the final in 2019, and his ability to work with young players. United's most recent poor result saw them lose to relegation battling Everton on Saturday, with Anthony Gordon scoring the only goal of the game. As well as really annoying Cristiano Ronaldo, the result makes it extremely unlikely that they'll finish in the top four and be in the Champions League next season. Perhaps Leipzig is a better role for Ten Hag, that would be the latest embarrassment at Old Trafford in the last nine years since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ There was lots of talk about the title decider ahead of the game, with Jamie Carragher claiming it was English football's 'greatest' ever rivalry. Other talk surrounded referee Anthony Taylor, with the Reds' fans annoyed that a referee from Manchester was allowed to take charge, despite the 43-year-old supporting National League side Altrincham F.C. Taylor didn't have too many big decisions to make for most of the game, as some great moments led to the two sides being level at 2-2. Late in the game however things exploded into life for the officials, as Fabinho's challenge on Bernardo Silva in the 82nd minute asked some big questions, with the midfielder only picking up a yellow card. Minutes later, Thiago was lucky that he didn't pick up a second yellow, as he seemed to take out Kevin de Bruyne, but Taylor this time didn't even give a foul. Yes, Fabinho should have received a red card and Thiago should have received a second yellow card. pic.twitter.com/jY47r8Zj4c That should've been a red for Fabinho pic.twitter.com/RzYJUcvqKQ Hmmm pic.twitter.com/CEsYyDFNyu You don't want to see red cards in this type of game but ... on another day Fabinho & Thiago could've walked within a couple of minutes of each other.

I just think he was desperate not to give any big decisions that got remembered as the reason one team won the title. And that's a dreadful way to referee a match. City fans were also to remind everyone that in the first game between the two sides this season, which also finished 2-2, Liverpool were lucky not to be reduced to 10 men. In that game, which included a superb goal by Mohamed Salah, former City player James Milner was on the receiving end of the refereeing decisions, as he didn't pick up a second yellow card. On Sunday the game was again considered one of the game's of the season, as Kevin de Bruyne opened the scoring after just a few minutes. Diogo Jota then equalised, before the Portugal forward nearly managed to nick the ball from Ederson in a moment of pure madness from the home team's goalkeeper. Gabriel Jesus' goal gave the hosts a half time lead, before Salah's pass set up Sadio Mane in the first minute of the second half to make it 2-2. Despite both sides having chances it remained that way, leaving Pep Guardiola's side still one point ahead of their rivals with seven games to go. ",positive,liverpool,5

Loadingâ¦ Liverpool found themselves behind at the break in what many people were considering a Premier League title decided, at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Despite Diogo Jota's goal, and Ederson trying his best to help Jurgen Klopp's side, City were the better team in the first half and led thanks to goals from Kevin de Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus. Salah especially had been surprisingly anonymous in the opening stanza of the game, and had lost the ball on eight occasions However, the Egyptian is rarely out of a game for too long, and inside the first minute of the second half he'd set up Mane. The Egyptian received the ball on the right wing from Trent Alexander-Arnold, in between two defenders, took two touches to create space and turn, and then played an inch perfect pass for his strike partner to run on to. Mane didn't take a touch to set himself, instead blasting past Ederson in the City goal to make it 2-2, the score the game at Anfield earlier in the season finished What a pass by Salah, absolutely stunning. That pass from Salah was absolutely exquisite. GOODNESS ME WHAT A PASS FROM MO SALAH! #LFC What an outrageous pass by Salah. My word. Salah's vision and pass for that goal. The closest thing to Messi in football right now. That pass from Salah was wonderful and what a finish from Mane.Great to see this game living up to the hype. Ahead of the game the build up to the match was huge, especially after Jamie Carragher claimed it was the 'greatest' rivalry in English football history. Both sides are trying to make history this season, with City hoping to win the Treble and Liverpool wanting to win an unprecedented Quadruple. There was just one point and eight games left ahead of kick off so either side winning would hugely swing the title race in their favour. So big was the match that even Jake Paul was getting involved with the talk, even if his analysis did leave fans questioning if he knew anything about football. The game started off at breakneck speed, with Raheem Sterling failing to open the scoring after just four minutes, only for De Bruyne to do it just over a minute later. Jota levelled things up in the 13th minute, when Ederson maybe should have done better, only for Jesus, a surprise starter to give City the lead again. That was until Salah's brilliant pass split the host's defence at the beginning of the second period. ",positive,liverpool,3

That dogged determination is what separated Puyol from the rest. He was the ultimate captain. ""No one is born a leader, it is surroundings and circumstances that develop them"" - Carles Puyol pic.twitter.com/rdEm0llAme He led by example. Take this footage from an old El Clasico, when Puyol sprinted back to the goal-line to head away a trademark blaster from Roberto Carlos' left boot. Not many would have even dared to use their head in this situation but the former Barcelona captain did not hesitate. As you can see in the clip below, former Los Blancos forward Raul was denied by the goalkeeper twice, which allowed Puyol time to track back. And when the ball fell at the feet of Carlos, you expected the ball to ripple into the back of the net. But no. Much to the delight of teammate Ronaldinho, who hugged his captain moments later, Puyol denied great rivals Madrid with the most Carles Puyol save of all time. Back in 2020, he posted the footage on Instagram alongside the caption: ""Today I found this video. I had never seen the play from this perspective before. ""Roberto, you almost ripped my head off, my friend! There are countless gestures that sum up Puyol as a man. He memorably invited AC Milan midfielder and former teammate Ronaldinho to join the Barcelona team photo in 2010. A year later, he placed the captain's armband on teammate Eric Abidal's arm when he famously lifted the Champions League trophy, just months after being diagnosed with cancer. In fact, Puyol said that the greatest moment of his 15-year career was that 2011 win against Manchester United at Wembley - not because of the result, but the fact that his friend was able to lift the trophy after a long battle with illness.

Loadingâ¦ On Wednesday, Sean Dyche's side added fuel to the flames of a very hot battle to stay in the Premier League, when they defeated Everton. It took Burnley to just a point behind Frank Lampard's team and eyeing the improbable escape from the top tier's bottom three, once again. They were dealt a blow on Saturday, when the Toffees shocked Manchester United at Goodison Park, on a very bad afternoon for Cristiano Ronaldo, and re-establish their four point cushion, but the Clarets knew they were facing fellow strugglers Norwich on Sunday. Pierre-Lees Melou gave his side an early lead, as the hosts dominated early on, but Dyche's men began to come back at Dean Smith's side in the second half. The introduction of Dwight McNeil really rallied the visitors and the winger provided a perfect ball for Cornet, who managed to miss from inside the six yard box, with Tim Krul beaten. You know you're definitely going down when... :joy::joy::joy: Thats how close Everton are going to stay up by isn't it https://t.co/U6wknqzJnu This is one of the worst misses I've ever seen because there wasn't even much pace on the ball https://t.co/fLXy2gPSZd Burnley could be chalked after that miss https://t.co/mO1O1JFRZL Miss of the season from Maxwel Cornet? #NORBUR pic.twitter.com/jiiRMOFdEc The Cornet miss sums up our season...

The sad thing is that if they are relegated then he would probably be one of the first of their players to ask his agent to arrange a new club for him next season.:soccer::relaxed: Dyche's side ideally would have needed all three points against the league's bottom team but a point would have been the absolute minimum. Cornet's chance was the perfect one to get back level and inevitably, having missed the chance of the afternoon, Norwich doubled their lead. Teemu Pukki scored the second goal when the Lancashire side switched off at a free kick, and the Finnish striker was able to slot home from inside the box. The win for Norwich, their first since beating Watford in January, means that the Canaries are seven points off safety, but only one point behind 19th place Norwich. Burnley go back to four points from survival, having reduced the gap right down in midweek, and both they and Everton, in 17th, have eight games to go. If they do go back into the Championship, Burnley may look back at Cornet's miss on Sunday and wonder 'what if.' ",positive,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Kane and Son are statistically the greatest partnership in the history of the Premier League, having combined for more goals than any other duo since 1992. Back in February, the England captain's brilliant assist for his Tottenham Hotspur teammate took them to 37 goals together, beating the 36 by Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard. However they haven't stopped since then and on Saturday they were at it again, as Son scored a hat-trick in a 4-0 win over Aston Villa. The South Korean's second goal came courtesy of a delicate little flicked header by Kane, which left the former Bayer Leverkusen striker running through on goal, and it showed the pure class of Kane's awareness as he took a quick look before executing the perfect header.

Kane was linked with Manchester City last summer and there's been reports he could still leave north London this summer. However if Antonio Conte's side do stay make into the top four this season, then it's less likely the 28-year-old will want to leave the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

One Gunners' fan has provided us with the latest clip of hilarity, blaming Tariq Lamptey's 'loan' from Chelsea as the reason for their defeat to Brighton. Loadingâ¦ Arsenal took another knock to their top four ambitions on Saturday afternoon, just days after being embarrassed by Crystal Palace, in a 3-0 win by Patrick Vieira's team. The weekend was Brighton's turn to pick up three points, as Graham Potter's side won 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium, after failing to win the previous seven games. Brighton didn't even start Lamptey, one of their most talented players, with the wing back coming on with 13 minutes to play, and his side 2-0 ahead. Yet that didn't stop AFTV's presenter asking if Lamptey's 'loan' from Chelsea was a problem, despite the 21-year-old signing permanently from the Blues in January 2020! The fan said 'it's all problem,' talking about the loan system in England, before going on to talk solely about Crystal Palace, and their results. He was of course referencing the fact that Vieira's side have actually loaned Conor Gallagher this season, with the midfielder in form for the Eagles against Arsenal less than a week ago, and he'd laid into the loan system following the game just five days before his newest rant. There is a point to his complaint, about Gallagher, and the fact that loan players can't play against their parent club in England, which does affect the integrity of the competition. That doesn't happen in Europe, where players can face the team they're on loan from, which happened to PSG this season when goalkeeper Marcin Bulka helped knock them out of the Coup de France with his performance in a penalty shoot-out for Nice. Despite perhaps having at very least a partially good point about Gallagher, the fact that the loans were being blamed for their two losses, and the fact that Lamptey isn't even on loan, caused much hilarity from rival fans. This fanbase is all slowly morphing into Ty https://t.co/DO2VsuA9KW lamptey came on in the 77th minute have some shame omg https://t.co/i1Mi0Ab4nC Things don't even get any easier for the anti loan brigade, with the Gunners set to come up against Southampton next, who just lost 6-0 to Chelsea. Ralph Hassenhutl's side have Armando Broja upfront, on loan from the Blues, and he couldn't play against his parent club in that game, a goal against Mikel Arteta's side would cause this one specific fan to lose his head. The Saints also have Tino Livramento at right back who, like Lamptey, moved from Chelsea on a permanent deal, but that doesn't seem to matter too much. Arsenal's latest loss, couple with Tottenham Hotspur's win against Aston Villa, later on Saturday, left them three points off the top four, though they do have a game in hand a north London derby to play.

Loadingâ¦ City and Liverpool are set to face in a huge clash that could even go as far as deciding where the Premier League title will end up this season. Only one point separates the two teams going into the match at the Etihad and they'll just be seven games left of the season come full time. There's no doubting the incredible talent that both Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp have at their disposal and it's tough to separate the teams, who have dominated England's top tier in the past four years. That's why making a combined XI of their players would be really tough to do, especially to find universal agreement, but it helps if you don't put Kyle Walker at centre back. The Match of the Day pundit picked his XI for the Premier League and he chose a 5-3-2 in order to crowbar the England full back into a position he hasn't played too regularly. I feel sick to my stomach pic.twitter.com/exLF7nOWQC The fact that Jermaine Jenas made it says it all really... pic.twitter.com/ojanv5TyuZ My man put hooferson..... walker at cb? and no dias? Jenas is stealing a living pic.twitter.com/fe45AENfQG All my jermaine jenas hate tweets are excusable just for this alone https://t.co/GBHCa0QSsi Jermaine Jenas is a menace to society https://t.co/A2fUKT1v9O Ahhh yes the traditional 5-3-2 that city and Liverpool play. All that fucking about just to shoehorn Walker in :joy: how does this joke get a job pic.twitter.com/gXGa8wmpnH Jermaine Jenas has managed (some how) to pick a combined 11 of #MCILIV that's is worse than either teams regular 11. pic.twitter.com/J7kL065Jeh what actually went wrong with jermaine jenas did he get dropped on his head as a baby or something pic.twitter.com/PSpPYOlheA I don't know what is worse Henderson ahead of Fabinho, Thiago, Rodri, gundogan OR going to a back 3 and then leave out Dias and Matip but have walker in there:joy: With players this good, a back three formation is beyond horrible. Jenas must've scribbled this while sat on the toilet immediately before The One Show. Usually when someone picks a combined XI it's done in the formation of one of the two teams, or a generic 4-2-3-1/4-3-3, depending what works best in the situation. Neither Guardiola or Klopp ever use a 5-3-2 system and to pick it in order to crowbar a right back in to play centre back, whilst ignoring some very good centre backs like Ruben Dias and Joel Matip is bizarre to say the least. There was also plenty of debate about the inclusion of Jordan Henderson, even from Liverpool fans, with Rodri and Fabinho both missing out in central midfield. Of course Jenas isn't the only pundit to cause huge debate ahead of the big game, with Jamie Carragher claiming the rivalry as the 'greatest' in English football history. Klopp agreed, but only jokingly after finding out who made the claim. On Sunday we'll get to find out if Carragher and Jenas were anywhere close with their opinions or if the court of social media was correct. ",positive,liverpool,4

Loadingâ¦ City, who sit one point ahead of their rivals, will have the home advantage this afternoon but it's so difficult to call as two of the world's best managers prepare to do battle. Ahead of the crunch clash, both men have been waxing lyrically about each other. ""Pep is the best coach in the world,"" Klopp said in a recent press conference. ""I think we would all agree on that and it might be a coincidence that it didn't work out in the Champions League so far. If anybody doubts him, I have no idea how that could happen."" Guardiola, meanwhile, hit back at the Liverpool manager with some compliments of his own. ""Jurgen makes world football a better place to live. His message, he is a huge competitor,"" he said. ""It's good. I try to have a good relationship with all the managers. I learned it's better not to have a relationship with others.

Sir Alex Ferguson vs Arsene Wenger springs to mind, as does Jose Mourinho's often fractious relationship with former Arsenal boss Wenger, who never shirked away from confrontation. But coming into Sunday's crunch clash, the atmosphere between both managers is different. Take a moment in 2019, for example. Just a day after Liverpool opened up an eight-point lead in the Premier League title race after knocking three goals past Manchester City, both Klopp and Guardiola bumped into each at the UEFA's Elite Club Coaches forum in Switzerland. And during that event, Klopp was speaking to the press when Guardiola was lurking behind in the background. The former Borussia Dortmund manager misheard a reporter in that chat, and it made for entertaining viewing. You can see the clip below. As you can see in the footage above, Klopp proceeds to run away after spotting Guardiola - a moment that has gone viral on several occasions since it happened.

In terms of his overall form, Maguire has struggled to hit the heights of last summer's performances for England at the European Championship. His poor form domestically has led to suggestions that the centre-back should be dropped from the team indefinitely. Last month, after the club's 4-1 defeat to league leaders Manchester City, former United forward Dimitar Berbatov said Maguire should be taken out of the firing line. ""Ralf Rangnick can step in here,"" the Bulgarian told Betfair. ""Maybe he needs to give Maguire a rest and give somebody else a chance."" There has been plenty of discussion surrounding Maguire's form of late and now, former United defender Nemanja Vidic has suggested that Rangnick could indeed step in and play the England international in ""easier games"" to find such much-needed confidence. ""Every player has a problem with form at some time in his career,"" Vidic told The Athletic. ""I did and it's clear that Maguire is not at his best this season ""I think you can do a few things and one of them is not to play every match as you try to find form again and get confidence. A coach could play him in easier games, not that there are many in the Premier League, and take him out for harder matches. ""The player needs to feel powerful and strong on the pitch again, not as it is now where he feels that it's not happening for him. It's difficult to play well when you're under so much pressure because people are waiting for you to make a mistake. You're asking me this and I'm replying as a coach.""

He spoke football becoming too much about about the individual, trust among players, watching Guardiola, van Dijk, Maguire, Serbia, Mitrovic, earning the roar of the crowd and much more. For @TheAthleticUK https://t.co/8fiSDU7D0L Another former United legend, Gary Pallister, branded Maguire a ""natural leader"" and suggested the defender will ""come back to his very best."" Speaking to BoyleSports, Pallister said: ""There's no getting away from the fact he's not in the best of form. I thought he had a decent game against Tottenham. The own goal came at a bad time but that happens to the very best, that's just a fluke. ""People say he hasn't done this or that, but I think he's been the natural leader for United over the last few seasons. ""I think he's been pretty good in a United shirt up until this season. I think he'll come back to his very best and, in the future, I think he and [Raphael] Varane will be the partnership at the back."" He added: ""There are factors to why he's had a dip in form but, ultimately, Harry has been pretty good and he's the only one who seems to be the natural leader in the dressing room.  ""That seems to be a big problem for United. I played with four, five captains in the teams I played in and I don't see too many natural leaders with that character and when things are tough in games, those characters can lead you through moments in matches and right now we haven't got them kind of leaders on the pitch.""

The subject of player earnings at Old Trafford has once again become a talking point on social media following United's latest defeat to relegation strugglers Everton. Ralf Rangnick's dominated possession for large spells at Goodison Park but they struggled to create any meaningful opportunities and were criticised for a lack of effort by some supporters. In fact, Everton ran 10km more than Manchester United on Saturday afternoon - a stat that highlights how much the Toffees wanted the victory compared to their counterparts. It has been a disappointing campaign for United all things considered. They splashed the cash to bring in Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund last year, but the talented winger has yet to really make his mark in Manchester. And in terms of player wages, they handed Â£2.2 million per month to five-time Ballon d'or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, according to French publication L'Equipe - a sum that equates to Â£26.4 million per year. So how much do they make? A total of four Manchester United players feature in the Premier League's top five biggest earners, according to the L'Equipe report. Ronaldo is the highest-paid player in the league, while Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne is the second-highest earner on Â£1.7 million per month [Â£20.4m]. David De Gea is said to rake in Â£1.6 million every month [Â£19.2m], teammate Jadon Sancho takes home Â£1.5 million per month (Â£18m) and former Real Madrid centre-back Raphael Varane earns Â£1.3 million a month [Â£15.6m] Paul Pogba, meanwhile, features in the Radio Times' top 10 list in ninth place and reportedly pockets Â£290,000-a-week. Interestingly, they suggest Kevin de Bruyne is the Premier League's highest earner above Cristiano Ronaldo, while two other Manchester City players are mentioned. Here is their top 10 list in full: 10. Thomas Partey (Arsenal) - Â£250,000 p/w9. Paul Pogba (Man Utd) - Â£290,000 p/w8. N'Golo Kante (Chelsea) - Â£290,000 p/w7. Raheem Sterling (Man City) - Â£300,000 p/w6. Jack Grealish (Man City) - Â£300,000 p/w5. Raphael Varane (Man Utd) - Â£340,000 p/w4. Jadon Sancho (Man Utd) - Â£350,000 p/w3. David De Gea (Man Utd) - Â£375,000 p/w2. Cristiano Ronaldo (Man Utd) - Â£385,000 p/w1. Kevin De Bruyne (Man City) - Â£385,000 p/w Thoughts on the player wages at Manchester United?

Sarah Kelly says she took her 14-year-old son, Jake, to his first Everton game on Saturday afternoon. He witnessed Anthony Gordon score a first-half winner as the Toffees went four points clear of the Premier League relegation zone. She claims they both had an ""absolutely brilliant day"" up until the incident after the full-time whistle. It was confirmed on Saturday that Manchester United were 'looking into' an incident involving the 37-year-old forward and a mobile phone following the club's 1-0 defeat against Everton. After walking past the away support at Goodison Park, Ronaldo was about to make his way down the tunnel when he appeared to drop a fan's phone on the ground, according to eyewitnesses. Twitter account @EvertonHub posted footage of the incident online and since, another angle of the moment has circulated online. In an interview with the Liverpool Echo, Jake's mum, Sarah, has claimed Ronaldo ""assaulted"" and ""bruised"" her son, who has autism and dyspraxia, when he appeared to knock the phone from his hand. ""At full-time the Man United players started walking off,"" Sarah said. ""We were in the Park End so we were right by the tunnel where they came walking past - my son was there videoing them all. ""He filmed all the United players walking through. And then he lowered his phone because Ronaldo had pulled down his sock and his leg was bleeding. He lowered his phone to see what it was - he didn't even speak. ""Ronaldo then just walked past, with a terrible, terrible temper and smashed the phone out of my son's hand and carried on walking. ""You can see by the bruise that he's made contact. I just can't believe I'm talking about it. ""I was crying, I was shook up, Jacob was in complete shock - he's autistic and he's got dyspraxia as well, so he didn't really digest what was happening until he's come home now. ""He's really upset about it and it's completely put him off going to the game again. This is the first football game he's been to and this has happened."" Sarah added: ""We had an absolutely brilliant day up until those final few seconds when they came off the pitch. It's completely ruined the day and put a bad taste in our mouth. ""He's an idol. Yes, he's not from Everton and you like who you like, but Ronaldo's a big player. My son's always been like 'Ronaldo's going to be there' - he's an icon. ""I'd understand if Jake was waving it in his face but he wasn't near his face, it was down by the floor checking his injury. ""He's an autistic boy and he's been assaulted by a football player, that's how I see it as a mum."" Hours after the incident, Cristiano Ronaldo apologised for his actions in a statement on Instagram. He also invited the fan to a game at Old Trafford as 'a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship.' ""It's never easy to deal with emotions in difficult moments such as the one we are facing,"" he wrote. ""Nevertheless, we always have to be respectful, patient and set the example for all the youngsters who love the beautiful game. ""I would like to apologize for my outburst and, if possible, I would like to invite this supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford as a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship.""

Edouard Mendy now holds the No 1 shirt for the Blues and the Senegal international kept a clean sheet on Saturday as Thomas Tuchel's side thrashed Southampton 6-0 at St Mary's. The result will come as a major relief to Mendy, who made a costly error in Wednesday's 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League which allowed Karim Benzema to score his hat-trick goal at Stamford Bridge. Loadingâ¦ Mendy faced criticism in the days after the defeat, with some Chelsea fans debating whether Kepa deserved an opportunity to play in goal against Southampton. One fan took to social media to highlight an impressive piece of quick-thinking from the Spaniard in a match earlier this season. The incident occurred in the second leg of Chelsea's Carabao Cup semi-final against Tottenham. Spurs forward Lucas Moura pounced on a loose ball just outside Chelsea's penalty area and was preparing to pass to Harry Kane, who was unmarked inside the box. Kepa, realising the danger, rushed to the edge of his area while his teammate Antonio Rudiger retreated to defend the goal-line. Moura passed the ball to Kane, who scored. But the goal was later ruled out by VAR after replays showed that England international was marginally offside, with Kepa in an unusual position behind the ball. A fan reposted a clip of the incident to Twitter on Friday, alongside the caption: ""Still haven't got over this 200 IQ offside trap by Kepa."" He added: ""The quick thinking and the football IQ being displayed here is out of this world. Kepa is truly the best goalkeeper at this club.""  Another wrote: ""That was brilliant tbf."" But others weren't so sure that it was an intentional effort to play offside by Kepa. ""I'm not sure if it's 200 IQ or if he just got lucky. It's a very close to being onside,"" wrote another fan. Was it an intentional offside trap by Kepa? Let us know your thoughts. Loadingâ¦ ",positive,liverpool,0

City raced clear of their title rivals over the festive period and at one point were 14 points clear of Liverpool at the top of the Premier League. However, Liverpool used their two games in hand to claw their way back into the title race after seeing City drop points against Tottenham and Crystal Palace.

The two title contenders will go head-to-head at the Etihad on Sunday in a mouth-watering clash at the top of the table and Guardiola says he always expected the Reds to fight their way back into contention. ""What is sure in Liverpool and City in the last years, we raised the bar and raised the targets that the Premier League had before,"" said Guardiola. ""The other teams realised they had to push more if they want to chase us. ""In the last five or six years, one year we were a little bit out, last year they had injuries and United was there. Both teams for 5-6 years we were there both teams, fighting. ""I'm going to tell you something: 14 points, it was fake. You were wrong. We played two more games [than Liverpool]. Fake. It was not a mistake."" Guardiola has praised Liverpoolâs consistency and has compared Cityâs rivalry with the Anfield club to his experience of managing Barcelona against Real Madrid. ""When we were 14 points ahead of Liverpool even myself I could not believe it because I know the incredible opponent we have to face. One of the best teams in Europe,"" he added. ""The reality is one point right now, this is the normal reality. It's an honour to be there to fight to win the Premier League. ""I lived this situation when I was in Barcelona; always Madrid, sometimes Atletico, but normally Barcelona and [Real] Madrid. ""Here it's always five/six teams, but in the last five years, two..

He has been head coach of the Belgian side for the last 18 months but has struggled to replicate the same success he had at City, with Anderlecht currently fourth in Belgiumâs Jupiler Pro League â 12 points behind leaders Royale Union Saint-Gilloise. Incredible footage has now emerged of Kompany ripping into his players after they conceded a 94th-minute equaliser to draw 2-2 at Sint-Truiden last October. The clip, which was taken from VOOsportâs documentary series about Anderlecht entitled Mauve, sees Kompany launch an expletive-ridden dressing room rant at his players â singling out on loan Bayern Munich striker Joshua Zirkzee for individual criticism. After throwing a water bottle to the floor, Kompany shouts: ""Listen, no misunderstanding, there's one f*****g side of me you haven't f*****g seen boys. ""Number one - whether we play with three, four, five or six [in defence] it's my f*****g decision. And I take the responsibility if we lose and if we don't perform well. ""The second thing. Zirk, last time I talked about your attitude you came up with only a f*****g smile. ""But I need that attitude.You were no good, just like all the others. I could have taken off anybody, without anyone complaining. ""Today we deserved to lose anyway.We can be f*****g happy with one point. Ninety-five minutes we just wasted time.You wasted your time, I wasted my time. ""It was better not to come.It was better to send the U21s."" The clip reflects the high standards Kompany has demanded throughout his career in football. The former Belgium international won 10 major trophies during his time with Manchester City, including four Premier League titles. He would leave the club in 2019 as an icon, with a statue later erected in his honour outside the Etihad. Loadingâ¦ ",positive,liverpool,0

Ten Hag, 52, is expected to become the next permanent manager at Old Trafford, with United reportedly close to finalising the appointment of the Dutchman. United are currently in talks with Ajax over a deal to secure Ten Hag's signature, with the Dutch champions set to receive a compensation fee of around Â£1.6m. Loadingâ¦ Paris Saint-Germain head coach Mauricio Pochettino was also being considered for the role but United chiefs have instead opted for Ten Hag, bringing to an end the club's long search for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's permanent replacement. Ten Hag's move is likely to be confirmed before the end of the season and the Dutchman is set to take charge in the summer, when interim manager Ralf Rangnick will move into a consultancy role at the club. However, Ten Hag's immediate attention remains with Ajax, who take on Sparta Rotterdam on Saturday. Ajax head into the match top of the Dutch Eredisivie, four points clear of closest rivals PSV. English media will not be allowed to attend the post-match press conference with Ten Hag this weekend, with Ajax chiefs keen for his focus to remain on winning a third league title with the club. Sky Sports News reporter Gary Cotterill said: ""As Ten Hag was preparing his team to face Sparta Rotterdam, the media team were busily rejecting the applications from the English media to attend the post-match news conference. There will be no radio, no newspapers, no Sky Sports News. ""They don't want him asked, in English, about Manchester United. His English isn't that great, either.

""It is a bit worrying that he is not doing any [English] media duties tomorrow because maybe he doesn't want to answer any difficult questions. ""But if he is to become the Manchester United manager then he is going to have to get used to answering tricky questions twice, sometimes even three times, a week. ""That could be something for Manchester United fans to worry about.""

32,https://www.sportbible.com/football/manchester-united-decided-against-mauricio-pochettino-for-two-reasons-20220408,Manchester United Decided Against Mauricio Pochettino For Two Reasons,"Mauricio Pochettino looks set to miss out on becoming Manchester United manager to Ajax's Erik ten Hag and reportedly there are two reasons. Loadingâ¦ Pochettino has long been linked with a move to United, both during and after his stint as Tottenham Hotspur manager, and continued to be linked with the role even whilst Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in charge. Once Solskjaer was sacked in November the PSG boss was quickly installed as the favourite to become the club's next permanent boss, however that changed over the months. Recently Ten Hag had increasingly become the most likely man and on Wednesday it was claimed that the Dutchman, who took Ajax to within a minute of the Champions League final in 2019, is set to become the manager. According to The i, Poch will miss out for two reasons, with United being concerned about his time in France and the price it could have cost them. The Argentine manager will almost certainly capture the Ligue 1 title this season, with his team 12 points clear of second place Marseille, with just eight games to play. However, having taken over from Thomas Tuchel at the Parc des Princes in January 2021, he was unable to capture the league title last season, finishing a point behind Lille and being in charge of four of the team's eight losses in the season. Along with that, the Parisians have continued to struggle in Europe, something they've done under most their managers, even if Tuchel did get them to the final. Last season they lost in the semi finals to Manchester City but this season's defeat was harder to take, as Karim Benzema's hat-trick in 17 minutes in the second half of the second leg dumped them out in the last 16. His 'underwhelming' time in the French capital is likely to lead him to get sacked, with Zinedine Zidane strongly linked with taking over, but as that is yet to happen United would have had to pay compensation to release him. That could have been up to Â£25 million, with PSG no doubt wanting to play hardball over the manager if they knew he was wanted elsewhere, even if they no longer wanted him. With United clearly hoping to make an appointment before the end of the season, in order to begin preparation for next season, it clearly went against Pochettino. The Premier League side are yet to agree compensation with Ajax for Ten Hag, but it is likely to cost them less and be quicker to do than the alternative. Ten Hag is said to have already begun identifying what he needs to do to turn things around at Old Trafford, and has reportedly already decided on his first transfer target. The former Bayern Munich II manager is also said to want to bring in someone who knows the Premier League and the club in as his assistant manager. Steve McClaren, who was number two to Sir Alex Ferguson during the 1998/99 Treble season, is said to be in the running for the position. ",positive,liverpool,0

Ten Hag, who has coached Ajax since 2017, impressed United officials during the chat, according toThe Times, who claim the club believe he would 'fit well into their structure' if he were to take over at Old Trafford. The Dutchman is now the bookies favourite to become United's new manager and, in a recent interview with German publication Sport1, he finally spoke about the United links.

Loadingâ¦ Ajax head coach Ten Hag is one of the favourites to land the job and has already held talks with United.

Former England boss McClaren could fulfil this role, having also previously managed Middlesbrough, Nottingham Forest, Derby County and Newcastle United. McClaren's last managerial appointment was at Queens Park Rangers, where he sacked in 2019.

Sources have told ESPN that United are preparing to finalise the appointment of Ten Hag, who is ready to leave his role as Ajax head coach at the end of the season to take over at Old Trafford. United have been without a permanent manager since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked in November, with interim boss Ralf Rangnick placed in charge of the team until the end of the campaign. Loadingâ¦ The Premier League club have been conducting a thorough search for Solskjaer's replacement and have now settled on Ten Hag, after holding talks with the Dutchman last month. The 52-year-old had reportedly been on a four-man shortlist along with PSG head coach Mauricio Pochettino, Spain manager Luis Enrique and Sevilla boss Julen Lopetegui. Unitedâs football director John Murtough and technical director Darren Fletcher have been responsible for the recruitment process, and have reported to chief executive Richard Arnold - with joint-chairman Joel Glazer having the final say. Sources have told ESPN that while some at the club were considering Pochettino for the role, Arnold and Glazer are in agreement that Ten Hag is the best candidate for the job. The report also claims that Rene Meulensteen, who was a first-team coach under former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson between 2007 and 2013, is being considered as Ten Hag's assistant manager. Former England manager Steve McClaren, who was Ferguson's No 2 at Old Trafford between 1999 and 2001, has also been linked with the job, having previously worked alongside Ten Hag at Dutch club Twente. According to the report, the managerial vacancy came down to a 'straight shootout' between Ten Hag and Pochettino. Former Tottenham manager Pochettino was initially the favoured candidate to replace Solskjaer. But a combination of PSG's dramatic defeat to Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League and the potential cost of releasing Pochettino from the final 12 months of his contract at the Parc des Princes have convinced United to opt for Ten Hag. According to the report, PSG are willing to hold out for a Â£15m compensation package from United for Pochettino, while the Premier League club will only have to pay Ajax a fee of Â£1.7m for Ten Hag.

The 52-year-old Ajax manager impressed United officials when he was interviewed for the role last week, according toThe Times. They claim the club believe he would 'fit well into their structure' if he was appointed. Ten Hag believes the United job is a five-year project, say The Independent, who suggest the first element he would correct at the Premier League club is physical conditioning.

Last week, The Telegraph said Ten Hag would attempt to bring highly-rated Ajax winger Antony to Old Trafford after an impressive season with the Eredivisie side, where he has scored 12 goals in all competitions. Now, reports have emerged that the Dutch manager will 'push' to bring Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves to the club. Ten Hag has followed Neves' progress for a number of years. In fact, he watched his progress at FC Porto, where he became the youngest captainin Champions League history after being handed the armband in their clash against MaccabiTel-Aviv. He believes the Portuguese international would help solve United's current issues in midfield, say The Sun, who suggest Ten Hag is 'pushing' for the move. United have been linked with a move for Neves in the past. During last summer's transfer window, Bruno Fernandes was said to be ""very keen"" for Neves to join the ranks at Old Trafford and United were aware of that, according to journalist Dean Jones, who was speaking toThe Football Terrace. Fernandes and Neves have played together with Portugal's national side on numerous occaisons, and were both in the squad for last summer's European Championship. Back in December, Neves opened up about his ambitions to play in the Champions League again â a competition that United could miss out on after struggling in recent weeks. In an interview with Portuguese publication Record, the 25-year-old admitted he misses it ""a lot"". ""I think any player that plays Champions League football and then spends a few years without competing in it will miss it,"" he added. ""It's a nice tournament to be part of, of course I miss it. It's a tournament every player wants to play in.

But they quickly realised they now had to defend a Lionel Messi free-kick right on the 18 yard line. Giving Messi a set-piece outside the area is as dangerous as conceding a penalty, with the six-time Ballon d'Or winner unbelievably prolific from dead-balls. Loadingâ¦ In stoppage time, having assisted two, Messi scored his second free-kick of this Copa America campaign and the 58th free-kick of his career by walloping the ball into the top corner on the goalkeeper's side. #CopaAmÃ©rica :trophy:Â¡Bombazo!

It's almost inevitable that when Messi places the ball down, he's going to find the net. And a clip of his preparation prior to his latest set-piece stunner gives insight into just why Messi has become the master of free-kicks. The way he preps the ball ... so much focus :dart: pic.twitter.com/KGlV4WyL2P For some, putting the ball down is a straightforward task that doesn't require much thought. But Messi, being the perfectionist that he is, takes his time and ensures the placement of the ball is bang on the money. He then moves to a crouched position, with his hand touching the turf as though he's ready to race Usain Bolt in a 100m sprint. While he's doing this, the 34-year-old is looking at the goalkeeper and assessing the situation before standing directly over the ball and preparing for his run-up. It's so meticulous and, to the surprise of absolutely no-one, Messi put the ball in the top bins to make it 3-0 with his eighth free-kick goal in an Argentina shirt. In recent years, teams have even started putting players on the line to defend his free-kicks but Messi has always had an answer. His technique and unique way of striking the ball has brought success from all angles and distances. Messi's leg when taking a free-kick has an angle of 50 degrees. He plants almost his entire boot on the ground before hitting the ball, giving him stability and control in the shot. Then, to improve his accuracy, Messi arches his shoulders and chest to caress the ball, hunching his body into a more compact position. ""When Messi strikes the ball, he shifts his hip to the right. He really moves his hips to the right as he's striking to open up his left strike leg,"" Dr Rajpal Brar told the Squawka podcast. ""And what that does on his plant leg is that it shifts all the weight to the outside of the foot. So then when he follows through and he's striking the ball - that left leg coming from left to right - now everything is going onto the outside of his ankle almost like what happens when you sprain your ankle. ""We call it 'inversion sprain' when it twists inwards - it's that same force. You have all that force on the outside of your ankle and it twists inwards. But in Messi's case, he's trained himself and his body to control that motion."" Has there ever been a better free-kick taker than Messi? It's hard to look past him. ",positive,liverpool,0

45,https://www.sportbible.com/football/manchester-city-and-liverpool-named-englands-greatest-football-rivalry-20220408,Manchester City And Liverpool Named England's 'Greatest Football Rivalry',"Jamie Carragher has claimed that Manchester City and Liverpool's rivalry is the 'greatest' in the history of English football. Loadingâ¦ City and Liverpool are both currently considered two of, if not the, best teams in the world and are battling it out on three fronts, with the Reds having already won the Carabao Cup. They are hoping to win an unprecedented quadruple this season, as they chase the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup and City could stand in their way on all three fronts, chasing their own Treble. Manchester United are the only team to have won the Treble in England in the past, and Sir Alex Ferguson's side did so in opposition with Arsenal, defeating the Gunners in the FA Cup semi final and beating them to the league by one point, on the last day of the season. #OnThisDay in 2005, Patrick Vieira vs Roy Keane in the Highbury tunnel. pic.twitter.com/OcaTA5jrMg The two sides finished one and two to each other in the league on five occasions, and there were some huge flash points in their rivalry, but Carragher believes the current clash is a 'greater' rivalry, mostly due to the quality of the two sides. ""There is a uniqueness to it. This is the first time the two best teams in England are the two best teams in the world, led by the two greatest coaches of their generation,"" the former Liverpool defender wrote in his column in the Telegraph. Arguing against the rivalry between Fergie's side and the one managed by Arsene Wenger, that saw the two sides finish one and two in the Premier League five times, Carragher mentioned their lack of rivalry in Europe. ""Arsenal were Unitedâs closest challengers when Fergusonâs side completed the treble in 1999, edged out in the Premier League and FA Cup,"" he added. ""But their rivalry never infiltrated the Champions League, aside from a semi-final in 2009, by which time Arsenal were not the force they were."" Carragher also argued that the two sides couldn't always claim to be the best two in Europe, whilst City and Liverpool can lay claim to that, despite neither being champions of Europe currently - which is a fair statement because being Champions League winners doesn't by definition make you the best in Europe as it's a knockout tournament. Arguing that the current top of the table rivalry 'ticks every box,' the Sky Sports pundit said, ""They are among the best teams to ever play in English football, guided by legendary coaches, who are well ahead of everyone else in this country. ""...Whenever City meets Liverpool, I see it as the best team in the world with the ball coming up against the best team in the world without it. ""That is a little simplistic. Liverpool are well-tuned at keeping possession, and City expertly drilled to get it back, but there is a style contrast which makes it one of the most tactically exciting games."" Carragher's arguments that the two sides are above anything on the pitch, in terms of quality, of previous rivalries in English football certainly holds some credence. However many will point to the fact that there is nowhere near the needle that existed between United and Arsenal, or even Chelsea and United, or Chelsea and Liverpool in the Premier League era. Whoever does come out on top in the current rivalry could certainly go down as the best team in the Premier League's history, especially if they go on to equal or even beat the feat by Fergie's side in 1999.

""An absolute legend."" ""Peter Drury is a vibe,"" a fellow Kopite commented. This is not the first time Drury has received universal acclaim for his work behind the mic. In 2018, he was commended for his commentary of Roma's stunning comeback against Barcelona in the Champions League, with one fan arguing that 'this commentary deserves the Ballon d'Or'.  ""It is a Greek from Mount Olympus!"" Drury exclaimed after Kostas Manolas put his side 3-0 up and thus ahead on away goals. ""Who has come to the seven hills of Rome and pulled off a miracle."" Unfortunately for Liverpool, Drury still had time to deliver another exquisite narration in the last 15 minutes of yesterday's match, after Kevin de Bruyne fired home an equaliser with 9 minutes to play. Chaces to take all three points fell for both teams, with Fabinho denied by a sensational Rodri block and Gabriel Jesus cornered well by Andy Robertson.

The 18-year-old starred for Spain at Euro 2020 then at the Olympics, helping his side win a silver medal. The Barcelona starlet has barely had a rest, playing non-stop since the end of the club season. Despite having barely a week of holiday, the youngster is due to return to Barca on Thursday as he's eager to join the team's dynamic ahead of the new term, according to Spanish outlet La Sexta. Since the start of the 2020/21 campaign, Pedri's played a staggering 73 matches - with the new season just around the corner. Though he's ready for action and could feature for Ronald Koeman's side when they open their La Liga venture against Real Sociedad on Sunday. It will come as a massive boost amid a turbulent time for Barca following Lionel Messi's shock exit and Sergio Aguero's injury. Speaking prior to the Olympics, Koeman said: ""Pedri had a phenomenal Euros. At only 18 years of age, he played almost all of the games in full with an impressive maturity. ""He is improving and he is a humble and relaxed boy. He lives for football. He is an example of how you have to be as a youngster at Barca. ""It's a shame for us, we have the maximum confidence, he is not worried and this season there is a great expectation of him. ""It's is important for our football base, that the youngsters see that they are at a club that gives them opportunities. ""Pedri has played a lot. We should give him as much rest as he needs during the summer. ""As Guardiola said, to play two important tournaments in the summer is too much, but we can't do anything about it.""

Spain broke the deadlock through Pedri's club and international teammate Ferran Torres in the 75th minute but were pegged back by Myrto Uzuni five minutes before time. Loadingâ¦ Olmo won it for La Roja in the last minute with a glorious curling finish into the top corner after a sublime cushioned touch from Jordi Alba. But the goal doesn't happen without an outrageous bit of vision and execution from Pedri, who played a stunning pass over the top.

Can't lie man we are witnessing the making of a legend :gem: pic.twitter.com/d29jsA6d8O Aptly wearing the No.10 for the first time in Spain colours, the perfectly-weighted pass went right over the head of the full-back and matched the run of Alba. You can't help but watch the pass and get serious Xavi and Iniesta vibes from Pedri, who is still only 19 years of age. A lot of players would go for the easy pass to feet or backwards and sideways but it's not in the nature of Pedri, already a world-class creator and orchestrator. There were fears that the 2021 Kopa Trophy winner would be seriously burned out after playing 70 games in an 11-month period but it's not been the case and he continues to marvel. When you see Pedri strut his stuff on the pitch, it's only normal to think we will be talking about him as one of the best midfielders in the game for a long time. Barca and Spain have a gem on their hands and he could have been turning out for Real Madrid if Los Blancos hadn't rejected him TWICE after he was initially unable to train because of snow. ""I trained for three days and I think since they were playing the next day, they took me down with the B team to train and in the end, they told me that I didn't have the level to be there,"" the former Las Palmas youngster said in a recent interview for Cadena Cope's 'El Partidazo' show. ""But now I'm where I want to be. At first you don't like being rejected, but then it motivates you to think that if they didn't want you now you're going to work so that something else could come in the future.

City are just one point ahead of Liverpool at the top of the table with eight games remaining in the campaign. Since Pep Guardiola arrived in English football in 2016, Liverpool have been Cityâs most consistent challengers for silverware. In fact, over the course of the last four seasons, the two sides have picked up nearly an identical number of points in the Premier League. City have taken 338 points from 144 games since the start of the 2018-19 season, while Liverpool have taken 337. The four-year table highlights to dominance of the two clubs, with Chelsea third on the list with 264 points from 143 matches played. Despite their struggles this season, Manchester United are fourth with 257 points from their 144 games. Liverpool and City will also meet in the semi-finals of the FA Cup on April 16, while both teams are in a strong position to qualify for the last four of the Champions League. Liverpool beat Benfica 3-1 away from home in the first leg of their quarter-final on Tuesday, while City beat Atletico Madrid 1-0 at the Etihad.

Salah opened the scoring in the Saturday kick-off with a superbly taken goal, but Liverpool missed a host of chances before Newcastle equalised five minutes into injury time at Anfield. Owen, however, said both Salah and Mane have ""been found wanting"" this season. ""That's the problem: Mane, brilliant player, scores lots of goals. Salah, unbelievable player as well, scores lots of goals,"" said Owen, who scored 158 goals for the club, per the Metro. ""But they're not natural finishers, they're not someone that you can hang your hat on. They've scored goals consistently because Liverpool have, like today, created so many chances. ""But they've been wanting, or the team have been found wanting a lot of the season with missed chances."" It seems a particularly strange accusation to level at Salah on the day he became the first Liverpool player to score 20 goals in three different Premier League seasons. The Egyptian doesn't play as an out-and-out centre-forward but he still boasts 123 goals in 198 games for Liverpool and is fairly clinical in front of goal. So we're not sure what Liverpool academy graduate Owen means. Mane has struggled at times this season and isn't as prolific as Salah - but he tends to play slightly further out wide and his still scored 94 goals in five seasons, while netting in some huge games. Liverpool certainly wasted chances against Newcastle, with Mane one of the guilty party. But if Salah isn't a natural finisher, Owen's standards must be sky-high. Ironically, then England manager Glenn Hoddle was once widely ridiculed for claiming the teenage Owen wasn't a natural finisher (though he later said his comments had been taken out of context and called Owen - who scored 40 goals for the Three Lions - one of England's greatest finishers). Owen scored some crucial goals for Liverpool, including two in an FA Cup final win over Arsenal in 2001, the year he won the Ballon d'Or. However he damaged his standing with many supporters by leaving the club to join Real Madrid, then eventually joining Liverpool's arch rivals Manchester United, where he won a Premier League winners medal. That was deserved for a player with 150 Premier League goals. Whether Owen's criticism of Mane's and - particularly - Salah's finishing ability was justified is another matter entirely.

Loadingâ¦ Diaz has made an impact for Jurgen Klopp since moving from Porto in January, and already looks like he's been playing with the team for years. The Colombian, who nearly signed for Tottenham Hotspur before moving to Liverpool instead, was so good on his league debut that even Klopp was surprised. On Tuesday he selflessly set up Mane for the Reds second goal, in their quarter final first leg, after Trent Alexander-Arnold's brilliant pass and then grabbed a goal for himself late in the game. That earned him the Man of the Match award and whilst he was being interviewed for television after the game he was interrupted by Mane, who showed him some love.

Previously there were questions about who could fill in upfront for the Reds if one of Mane, Roberto Firmino or Mohamed Salah were missing. That has changed in the past 18 months with the introductions of both Diogo Jota and now Diaz, and any of them could easily start without much drop in quality. Diaz wrapped up the scoring late on in the game for the Premier League title chasers, putting them in a great position ahead of next week's second leg at Anfield. For his troubles, the 25-year-old had a stick thrown at him by a member of the crowd, as he celebrated, the latest example of that kind of thing happening recently.

Loadingâ¦ Klopp will currently be worrying which of his team is available to play in the FA Cup this weekend, following the postponement of Liverpool's Carabao Cup semi final on Thursday. After that though the German has to work out how to replace Mane and Salah in his first choice XI for the next few weeks, whilst they're at the African Cup of Nations, while trying not to lose any more ground on league leaders Manchester City. Whilst Diogo Jota, Divock Origi and Roberto Firmino will be important to their chances of keeping up their form, Klopp will need some sort of reinforcement. It looks like that will come in the form of Porto forward Luis Diaz, with the Sun claiming that the forward is 'close' to a move to Anfield this month. The report says that Dias has a Â£67 million release clause but that the Premier League title challengers are hoping to get him for slightly less. They expect the 24-year-old to cost closer to Â£60 million, and his arrival is only imminent because of AFCON, as Klopp originally preferred to wait for the summer to sign the forward. Liverpool were likely to have to freshen up their forward line in the coming years, with Mane, Salah and Firmino all nearing or in their 30s and having played as a trio for a few years now. The introduction of Jota was first part of that boost to their attacking ranks, with the former Wolves striker now arguably ahead of Firmino in the pecking order. Dias is seen as the next part of that, and the perfect back up to Mane and Salah, having impressed the manager during two games against the English team in this season's Champions League. The Colombian, who signed for the Primera Liga side in 2019, has scored 12 goals in the league so far from just 15 games, and grabbed another two in Europe. No one scored more goals than him at last summer's Copa America, with Lionel Messi level with him on four goals but winning the Golden Boot due to having more assists than Dias. With the team now nine points behind Manchester City and potentially a couple more league games before their two main forwards are back at Anfield, Liverpool will be hoping any new signing can hit the ground running.

In a 15-year spell with Barcelona's first team, he captained his team to numerous titles, including three Champions League winners medals, six La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey's and two UEFA Super Cup's. On this day in 1999, Carles Puyol made his Barcelona debut.He played in 593 matches, winning 21 trophies.8x Spanish Super Cup :trophy:6x LaLiga :trophy:3x UEFA Champions League :trophy:2x Spanish Cup 2x FIFA Club World Cup:trophy:2x UEFA Super Cup :trophy:Captain fantastic :red_circle::large_blue_circle: pic.twitter.com/dvJmGXaKiP On the international stage he also won over 100 caps for Spain, winning the European Championships in 2008 before lifting a World Cup two years later after that 118th minute from Andres Iniesta. But for many, it was Puyol's incredible attitude and application that made him stand out on and off the pitch. He was hard, but fair. Just take a look at this compilation - a man with great morals. Puyol once said: ""I don't have RomÃ¡rio's technique, Marc Overmars' pace or Patrick Kluivert's strength, but I work harder than the others. I'm like the student who is not as clever, but studies for his exams and does okay in the end."" If a quote had to sum up this incredibly hard-working centre-back from the small town of La Pobla de Segur in Catalonia, this would be it. His character and personality was often seen on the pitch. Back in 2010, he invited AC Milan midfielder Ronaldinho to join Barcelona's team photo. He also memorably placed the captain's armband on teammate Eric Abidal's arm when he famously lifted the Champions League trophy, just months after being diagnosed with cancer. In a typically selfless quote soon after Abidal lifted the cup, Puyol said that the greatest moment during his 15-year career was the 2011 Champions League win at Wembley. Not because of the result, but the fact that his friend was able to lift the trophy after a long battle with illness. Along with the morals that stood him in such high regard during his career, a story from one of his closest friends Gerard Pique, who he talks about in our interview below, really typifies his attitude to the cause. As told by Sid Lowe from The Guardian, the Barcelona defender describes Puyol with a perfect story. ""I can't imagine a Barcelona team without him,"" PiquÃ© says. ""He wears me out! I remember the day he came back after injury and in the middle of the game I said: 'Puyi, I've missed you so much.' He told me to shut the hell up and concentrate. He never stops. ""One time, the game was stopped, someone was on the stretcher, and he was shouting at me. I said to him: Calm down, it's 4-0 and there are three minutes left.' He said: 'So what? Focus! I know you.' I was dying with laughter. ""Puyol keeps you on your toes at all times."" ",positive,liverpool,0

Barca were already 4-0 up when Thiago headed in an ugly fifth goal from Alves's cross. Cue a choreographed dance celebration between the pair. Puyol ran between them and if the booty-shaking duo thought their captain had arrived to join in, they were quickly put right. He shoved Alves towards the centre circle and gave Thiago a little push in the back of the head, while giving both a serious telling off. There was no violence in his actions, but Puyol's expression makes it clear he was unimpressed by Barcelona players laughing at taking a 5-0 lead against a struggling La Liga side. Judging by the dead-eyed reaction from Guardiola and his assistant Tito Vilanova on the bench - neither of whom moved a muscle at the goal - they were behind their captain on this one. The defender known as 'Captain Caveman' played hard but fair and his career was touched with moments of sportsmanship. In 2011 he stepped aside to let Eric Abidal, recently recovered from surgery to remove a tumour in his liver, lift the Champions League trophy first. ""I can't explain the emotions I have,"" said Abidal afterwards. ""It's spectacular. I'm so thankful for the gesture."" It wasn't the only time Puyol would ensure Abidal was front and centre for Barcelona honours. We doubt Thiago and Alves were as grateful for the gesture of being physically manhandled, but Puyol's reaction was understandable. Not only was rubbing in a 5-0 lead against inferior opponents poor form, but Barcelona had lost their previous Liga game to Real Madrid - pretty much confirming that their rivals would win the title in 2011/12. Puyol saw no reason for fun and frolics in this - and let his teammates know how he felt. Pedro and Lionel Messi finished off the scoring to end the game 7-0, but both knew better than to start doing the robot in celebration and risk Puyol's instant wrath. ",positive,liverpool,0

Van Dijk performed heroically inSouthampton's 1-1 draw at Man City, with fans raving about his showing at the back. Liverpool fans wasted no time in reacting to the clip, highlighting the claim that he was a world class operator before he joined Jurgen Klopp's team. In the Premier League fixture back in October 2016, the video shows Van Dijk being commanding and nullifying the threat of Sergio Aguero.

There was a lot on the line for both clubs at Goodison Park. United, who have struggled in recent weeks, needed a win to stay in the race for a top four spot, while Frank Lampard's side couldn't drop any more points in their bid for Premier League survival. It was a cagey start to proceedings but after a disappointing midweek defeat against Burnley, the Toffees bounced back with a hard-fought win against Ralf Rangnick's men, as a 27th-minute strike from teenager Anthony Gordon sealed a crucial win. Despite having good spells of possession throughout, United struggled to pose any sort of attacking threat. Marcus Rashford had a number of chances early on that were parried away by Jordon Pickford but apart from that, it was a poor overall performance. And after the full-time whistle, Manchester United shot-stopper David de Gea, who has not been afraid to give his opinion in post-match interviews, once again gave an honest assessment of his side's efforts against the Premier League strugglers. Here is that interview in full. De Gea said: ""It is a disgrace from us to be honest, we should be winning this game. ""We don't score but we don't create proper chances to score. We are not good enough, that is for sure. It will be difficult to be in the top four. ""They played Wednesday and they were tired but they had more desire than us, that is not acceptable.

""It's difficult,"" he told the BBC. ""If we don't win our own games it doesn't make sense to hope for good results from the other teams."" He also played down suggestions that their current search for a new manager was a distraction. ""I don't think this should be an excuse,"" he told BT Sport. ""We are Manchester United. We have lots of international players. There shouldn't be an alibi. ""There will be a new manager next season. If this is announced now or in 10 days it shouldn't have an impact.""

Burnley came from behind to beat Everton 3-2 at Turf Moor, to cut the gap to their relegation rivals to just a single point. Maxwel Cornet scored the winning goal five minutes from time to seal a dramatic comeback for the home side, who were trailing 2-1 at the break. Loadingâ¦ Speaking after the match, Dyche says he used his half-time team talk to remind his players of Evertonâs fragility this season. âSometimes the mentality is hard. Iâve been down there, I know what itâs like. Every season there have been tough patches for us,â Dyche told Sky Sports after the match. âItâs hard to explain but sometimes you can of sense that a team might have lost how to win a game. âI said to them at half-time âIâm not sure these lot know how to win a game ladsâ, away from home particularly. âI said âWeâve got to play on that mentality, we do it by playing forward with better quality.â ""I said at half-time, I'm not sure [Everton] know how to win a game lads"" ð Brutal from Burnley boss Sean Dyche boss following their 3-2 win over #EFC! pic.twitter.com/IGq8zcG2HK âIt wasnât glorious but there were enough patches where we found three goals.

The Brazilian then scored a second penalty four minutes before the break after a VAR review judged that Vitality Mykolenko had been fouled by former Everton winger Aaron Lennon. Burnley equalised in the second half through Jay Rodriguez before Cornet capitalised on a mistake from Ben Godfrey to secure all three points for the hosts. The Clarets remain 18th in the Premier League after the win but are now just a point behind Everton, who have to face Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea in the coming weeks. Everton have won just two of their nine Premier League games under Frank Lampard, who was disappointed his side could not hold on to their lead. âAt 2-1 we should win the game by more goals,â he told Sky Sports. âWe were not clinical enough with our chances.

Potter's side could only manage to hit four of those 30 shots on target throughout the Premier League clash â a stat that was questioned after the full-time whistle. Norwich have conceded 63 goals in 30 matches this season. Brighton nil... In fact, Brighton became the first team to have 18 shots off target in a Premier League game since Chelsea in February 2011, according to OptaJoe. And in an interview with The Telegraph, he addressed the stats. âThe build-up suggests weâre getting there. Of course, the longer you go, you can hear the crowd, âshoot, shoot, shootâ, you know, and that sometimes is a challenge for the players. âBecause sometimes thereâs an opportunity to shoot - sometimes itâs a chance for the block and then the transition. And sometimes maybe one more pass gets you in a better position but, if you miss the pass, you should have shot. âItâs just one of those things that weâre going through. A bit of pain and a bit of suffering. âSo, then, that does affect confidence.

COMEONYOUBLUES! ðµâªï¸#EVEBUR pic.twitter.com/2jpbkN62sX Ahead of the game, our tipster Robert Mann takes a look at some of the best bets from Everton vs Burnley to get your teeth stuck into. Everton are 4/6 to win, with Burnley priced at 9/2 to come away with the victory. A draw is priced at 13/5. Prediction: 2-1 (7/1) First Goalscorer: Demarai Gray (6/1) Having scored in just two of his previous 32 appearances, Demarai Gray has founded the back of the net twice in his three appearances for Everton. His creativity and flair could offer one or two issues for Sean Dyche's Burnley and we're backing the 25-year-old to draw first blood tonight. To Score 2+ Goals: Everton (10/11) Everton have scored at least twice in each league match so far this campaign and there are signs that Benitez is instilling the consistency that the Merseyside outfit need. As a result of their recent form, we're backing the Toffees to score at least twice again here tonight, especially with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Richarlison both in hot form. Headed Shot On Target: Dominic Calvert-Lewin (5/6) Calvert-Lewin has been in excellent form for Everton over the past year and has proven himself to be almost unstoppable in the air. He scored a header against Southampton on the opening day of the season and thereâs no reason why he canât repeat that feat again tonight. Odds are correct at the time of publication and are, as always, subject to change. Please gamble responsibly. For more information visit: https://www.begambleaware.org.

On Tuesday, they host Atletico Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final, and will also come up against Liverpool in the semi-finals of the FA Cup at Wembley on April 16. Laporte believes Cityâs consistency in recent seasons has made them a target in English football - with other clubs, most notably on the other side of Manchester, desperate for them to slip up. âYou notice that,â Laporte added. âMaybe itâs not that theyâre tired of us but they donât think itâs normal we always win.

Tevez, 38, has been without a club since leaving Boca Juniors in July but the former Argentina international has not officially retired from football. Tevez has previously played for West Ham, Manchester United and Manchester City, but has not played in the Premier League since leaving the Etihad in 2013. Loadingâ¦ However, he could now be in line for a shock return to English football. According to Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport, Tevez is set to meet with Conte and his coaching staff at Tottenham's training ground next week. Conte previously signed Tevez from Manchester City when he was manager of Juventus in 2013. The pair spent just a single season together in Turin before Conte left to become manager of the Italian national side. But he is now reportedly considering a reunion with the striker, who won the Premier League twice with United and once with City during his time in English football. Tevez has also visited a number of Italian clubs, fuelling speculation he could return to Serie A instead. After visiting his former club Juventus and Inter Milan, Tevez was also spotted at AC Milan's training ground - embracing manager Stefano Pioli and club legend Paulo Maldini. Tevez has also been linked with a move to the MLS, with DC United, Minnesota United and Orlando City reportedly interested in the striker. Tottenham previously attempted to sign Tevez from Manchester City in 2012 when Harry Redknapp was manager. He said at the time: ""I said to the chairman 'can you get me Carlos Tevez?' ""Daniel (Levy) made some enquiries, but it wasn't doable. If he could have done it, he would have. ""He (Levy) would have loved Tevez, but it wasn't possible because his wages are Â£200,000 a week. It's not possible at Tottenham to buy him."" Tevez joined West Ham in a controversial move from Corinthians in the summer of 2006 and would go on to help the London club avoid relegation that season. He would later join Manchester United on a two-year loan, winning both the Premier League and Champions League during his time at the club. Tevez would cross the city to join rivals Manchester City in 2009 for a then British transfer record of Â£47m. He would go on to score 73 goals in 148 games for City, helping the club to their first ever Premier League title in the 2011-12 campaign. In total, Tevez managed 84 goals in 202 games during his time in the Premier League and has scored 237 goals in 607 games over the course of his professional career. ",negative,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ Kane's potential move away from Spurs took a huge turn this week, with the striker reportedly missing training on Monday and Tuesday without permission from the club. The England captain told the club at the end of last season that he wanted to leave, as he wants to start winning trophies. That's also the topic of the post that Son has liked on social media, that points out Kane hasn't won anything during his time in north London and pointed out that no played is bigger than the club. ""A player is never bigger than a club. 'Harry Kane FC' has 0 Trophies. Tottenham Hotspur has 26 Trophies,"" the post said. ""It is understood that Harry Kane does not want to remain at Spurs following a lack of success, however his attitude and methods of attempting to force a transfer, are disrespectful. Kane has the right to leave yet not to take about it in this matter!"" A post shared by Tottenham Hotspur News Page (@thfcsource) Son is already a fan favourite at Tottenham and the fact the South Korean forward has signed a new deal will only make him more popular. The former Bayer Leverkusen forward continuing to try and win something for the club, whilst Kane tries to force a move away, certainly won't harm him either. It's been 13 years since the north London club last won a trophy, when they beat Chelsea in the final of the League Cup, and they've only had near misses since. Kane and Son have been in losing two finals together, in the Champions League in 2018 and the Carabao Cup earlier this year. Kane wasn't fully fit for either and failed to have any impact on the games, as Spurs lost to Liverpool and Manchester City, respectively. The England striker also lost the Euro 2020 final this summer, whilst Son at least won gold at the Asian Games in 2018. ",positive,liverpool,1

Son was criticised after the match by United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for overreacting to McTominay's hand in his face (although the contact was definitely there). However it's clear that the likeable Son was taking this defeat as hard as any Spurs fan. That was obvious from the emption on the South Korean star's face during an interview where he was clearly, deeply upset about his team's on-pitch woes.

Loadingâ¦ Spurs and West Ham were both desperate for the three points, as they continue to hope they can catch London rivals Arsenal to finish in the top four. Things didn't start well for the Hammers, as Kurt Zouma scored an own goal after just nine minutes, and Son really made the difference with his two goals, despite Said Benrahma getting his side back in the game to make it 2-1. Whilst his goals, and the part that Harry Kane played in both of them, was being lauded, the South Korean forward blotted his copy book with an embarrassing dive.

Barca's greatest ever player almost left the club last summer and the Catalan giants want to avoid similar drama by re-signing Messi - but at the same time, Barcelona have an eye-watering debt said to be around â¬1 billion to consider. So their solution, as reported by Deportes Cuatro, is to sign the 33-year-old to a 10-year deal that will take him beyond his playing days. The theory is that Messi receives long-term financial security to make up for the pay cut, while Barcelona ensure that the Argentine sees out his playing career at the club and can then transition into another role, either an ambassador or a club executive. There are less than nine weeks of Messi's current contract at the Camp Nou left, so the club risk losing their iconic No 10 if a deal isn't signed soon. However if the details of Messi's salary leaked by L'Equipe earlier this year are to be believed, he is currently paid a weekly wage of Â£2.1 million. That works out at an astonishing Â£108.2 million per year. So it's understandable that Barcelona want to halve that salary without giving Messi license to walk away - and one of the elements of the deal is that, while Messi would stay at the Liga club in the short term, he would be allowed a season in the MLS at the end of his career if he wished. According to the Times, the new contract is on the table following extensive talks between club president Joan Laporta and Messi's father. The report adds that Messi is desperate to win a Champions League title one more time and that the pay cut is more appealing if it helps the club land another star name that could help Barcelona achieve this. Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City and clubs in the US have all been linked with signing Messi. But if Laporta gets his way, Barcelona's record goalscorer will be signed to the club until 2031 at least. All imagery: PA Images ",positive,liverpool,0

Despite some lengthy talks surrounding a new deal, the expectation is that he will stay at Barcelona next season and according to Spanish publication AS, he is set to extend his contract for two more years. Last week, La Liga president Javier Tebas announced that Barca have exceeded their wage cap and will therefore fall under a ""special procedure"" next season. It means the club will have to make significant changes to their finances in order to renew Messi's deal which expires at the end of the month.

Maguire, 28, has become a crucial figure for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer since his whopping Â£80m move from Leicester City in 2019.

Vidic awarded the England star an eight out of 10 rating, adding that Maguire is ""still improving."" He wrote for The Athletic: ""Harry Maguire looks confident and comfortable, even more for his country than for Manchester United. ""He's a defender who is still improving, but if he wants to be recognised at the highest level he has to win trophies. When I look at Maguire I see a defender who is good at everything, 8/10 at everything.

The rules outlined that each player must score direct from a corner with first their left foot and then their right foot, with the ball not allowed to bounce before crossing the goal line. For those who have played football you'll know how difficult this, especially with your weaker foot. McMahon stepped up first and managed to score with his left foot after three tries. Next is Maguire and he was as cool as you like, whipping one into the far bottom corner on his first try. Even his teammates were stunned and Collins couldn't contend, taking five tries to score with his left. You'd imagine everyone would fare better on their stronger right side for the next round. Well, they didn't. McMahon took 14 tries to get one in and Collins a staggering 20. What about Maguire? He managed to stay in single digits and nailed it in a respectable three attempts. The final scorecards then read Maguire 4, Collins 25 and McMahon 18. Maguire looks incredibly pleased with himself at the end as his teammates look towards him with envy. Fans have reacted to the footage and they're impressed with Maguire's technique. One commented: ""I would die of starvation on that training ground trying to score direct from a corner with my left foot."" Another said: ""We laugh at defenders but most are more skilful than we could ever dream of being.""  A third put: ""I'm a Sheffield United fan and this is amazing what a player he is now our academy raised this beast up.""  While someone explained: ""Well we can see why he's a Premier League footballer."" Maybe United could've done with his corners during their run of 139 in a row without scoring. It's been a tricky season for Maguire and the Red Devils look likely to miss out on Champions League football. The England international has been criticised for his performances this campaign, after impressing at Euro 2020. United return to action after the international break against Leicester City.

Varane, 28, was officially announced as United's latest signing on Saturday ahead of the club's 5-1 thumping of Leeds United at Old Trafford. Loadingâ¦ The 2018 World Cup winner, who spent a decade at Real Madrid, received a spine-tingling reception from the Old Trafford faithful ahead of kick-off. Varane penned a four-year deal with United and will wear the No 19 shirt, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer calling him ""one of the best defenders in the world over the last 10 years."" A post shared by Raphael Varane (@raphaelvarane) The former Madrid star is Solskjaer's third summer signing after the additions of former Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho and Tom Heaton. Merson hailed Varane as the ""signing of the summer in the Premier League"" and believes that he can transform United into title contenders. The Sky Sports pundit added that the new United centre-back is a ""major signing"" and he will have a ""massive impact"" at Old Trafford. Speaking in his column for The Daily Star, Merson wrote: ""Raphael Varane will turn Manchester United into title contenders -- he's the signing of the summer in the Premier League. ""I think it's as tight as it's ever been this season and there's four teams who could win the league. ""United weren't one of them but Varane changes that. I think that's a major signing. With all the class and experience he brings with him from Real Madrid, I think he's going to have a massive impact."" United boss Solskjaer was keen to add an experienced defender to his ranks to partner alongside Harry Maguire for the new season. Maguire, 28, took to social media on Saturday to welcome Varane to the United squad. Welcome mate @raphaelvarane Thank you captain!! Read More: Both Vidic and Ferdinand forged a formidable partnership under legendary former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. And now Merson claims that United have filled the void left behind by Vidic and Ferdinand with their new partnership between Maguire and Varane. ""United now have a new Vidic and Ferdinand partnership to rely on at the back. Maguire can get tight to people and Varane can sweep up behind with his pace,"" he explained. ""United played with two holding midfield players a lot last season because Ole Gunnar Solskjaer didn't trust his defenders. They won't need to do that now. They were as good a counter-attacking team as anyone last season. ""But now, with Varane, they can take more risks and play on the halfway line. That's important against the lesser teams. You can really put them under pressure instead of having that fear of one long ball over the top catching you out."" ",positive,liverpool,0

Vidic is one of the most-feared defenders in Premier League history and was a rock for United across eight years. Not many strikers fancied their chances against the Serbian, but Balotelli attempted to give it a go during his time at Manchester City. The two sides faced off in the 2011 Community Shield with Balotelli and Vidic getting into a scuffle. Balotelli took issue with Vidic hauling him to the ground and they quickly butted heads upon getting to their feet. It only took a few seconds for the Italian to back down however and he didn't look too thrilled walking away. One fan commented: ""Vidic is one of those mature players who never got into a fight but could smash any opponents if he wanted to."" Another added: ""Balotelli thought he was dueling Rio Ferdinand than he turned, saw Vidic and walked away.""  A third stated: ""It's not just mario..there isnt a player in the league who wanted to catch a fade with Vidic... Serbian beast!""  While a fourth explained: ""One of my favourite Vidic moments. Balotelli sizes up thinking he's going to intimidate him, Vidic doesn't flinch for a second and suddenly Super Mario turns into a Shy Guy."" Balotelli isn't the only man to feel Vidic's wrath - although Kyle Walker got hit with a fiery tackle to boot. United took on Tottenham Hotspur in 2013 and found themselves 2-1 down early in the second half. Realising the tempo needed to be upped, club captain Vidic decided to smash into Walker out on the wing. A loose ball bounces to the edge of the box and both players decide to go with it as fast as possible. Walker is still one of the league's fastest players and reached the ball quicker - but he didn't bargain on Vidic's massive lunge. He went to ground and clattered into Walker, who flipped high into the air before crashing down to the White Hart Lane turf. It was a fair tackle however and it means Vidic could dust himself off and continue the game with no punishment. The tackle has become so synonymous with Vidic's no-nonsense image, he was even asked about it after retiring. He told FourFourTwo in 2016: ""I don't remember all of my tackles - I was sometimes playing with concussion - but I remember that one. ""Kyle went honestly for the ball and so did I. It's why I like that challenge: it doesn't matter who won; what mattered is that we both went for the ball. I love that about English football and hope it never changes.""  ",positive,liverpool,0

Despite splashing the cash for a number of years, United will once again go trophyless this season after last week's Champions League elimination at the hands of Atletico Madrid. Last month, Championship side Middlesbrough knocked Ralf Rangnick's side out of the FA Cup in round four, while their poor form in the Premier League continues to cause unrest as they sit 20 points behind leaders Manchester City. It has been a disappointing campaign given the talent at their disposal. And their reported annual spending on player wages will only bring more debate amongst supporters. According to the guys over at L'Equipe, five-time Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo is the highest paid player in the league. He takes home a reported Â£2.2 million per month, which equates to Â£26.4 million per year.

After Jadon Sancho completed his move from Borussia Dortmund for around Â£73 million - after being part of the England group that reached the European Championship's final - World Cup winning centre back Raphael Varane would follow week's later for in excess of Â£35m, joining from Real Madrid. The icing on the cake was to come as club announced that they had struck a deal with Juventus to bring club legend Cristiano Ronaldo back to Old Trafford in a deal where United could pay the Italian giants up to Â£20m for the 36-year-old Golden Boot winner, who will become the league's highest ever earner on around 510K per week. With both Sancho and Varane reportedly earning around 350K a week that equates to over Â£60 million in wages for the three players. To put this into context, it is more than both Leicester City and West Ham United's total annual wage bill, with both clubs qualifying for the Europa League. Newly promoted Brentford pay Â£12.8m per year which is five times less than United pay for their three marquee signings. Now I know the club hasn't won a trophy since 2017 and this is what manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer craves so badly, as he conforms to the standards required in the institution that Manchester United is but it does raise questions. Should there be a wage cap? Do the 'bigger' clubs deserve to spend more because of commercial gain? Regardless, it doesn't look like things are going to change. The thought of a level playing field is just that at the moment with PSG also being able to fork out huge wages for Messi, Ramos etc due to the fact they can make a good bulk of their annual outlay back in merchandise and shirt sales. The moves made by United to bring the nostalgic element into play however, and we could be set to see them return to the peak of the Premier League once more as club's such as Arsenal and Liverpool who also have a big global fanbase, are hamstrung due to the effects of the pandemic, and have not been able to strengthen significantly compared to United and Chelsea.

Anthony Martial fired United into the lead before half-time, but Andros Townsendâs crucial second-half equaliser rescued a point for Everton on Saturday. Loadingâ¦ United have only won two of their last five matches across all competitions, with Solskjaer subjected to fierce criticism over the clubâs consistency and results. Solskjaer, who signed a new United deal in July, has the backing of Red Devils executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward to lead the club going forward. However, the United manager now has five âunhappyâ players in his squad to answer to after their disappointing draw with Everton.

The newspaper added that David de Gea was furious at full-time and shared his disappointment with his United teammates. Jadon Sancho, who has struggled to make an impact at United, has found himself played out of position on the left wing under Solskjaer instead of his preferred right winger role. Donny van de Beek has endured a disappointing spell and expressed his growing frustration during his outburst in Unitedâs 2-1 win over Villarreal in the Champions League. Read More: Solskjaer claimed that United âlacked that important cutting edgeâ to score a second against Everton and seal all three points at Old Trafford. âWe did have enough players behind the ball, we made a couple of bad decisions which cost us in those 10 seconds or whatever it fell,â he said. âWe were organised well enough behind the ball, but we should have dealt with the danger better. âToday we dominated the game, we just couldn't get that second goal that you need in games like this. Everton, as we knew from last season, can score a goal from nowhere. âIt was about the counter-attack that they threw at us. We were well enough organised, we should have dealt with the situation a lot better. âYou can focus on dropping deeper and allowing them to have the ball, today we had 75 per cent possession or whatever it was, and we got hit on one break there that cost us. âAnd we lacked that important cutting edge to get the second goal.â United will resume their Premier League campaign on 16th October against Leicester City at the King Power.

Loadingâ¦ Last season United had their best finish since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, when they finished in second, 12 points off champions Manchester City. Solskjaer struggled to get the best out of his team at times, especially against other members of the 'big six' and was accused of being too negative, earning just 11 points in the 10 games against them and scoring only eight times. In those games United often played Scott McTominay and Fred in central midfield together and had to sacrifice at least one of his attacking players. However it looks like the manager is going to change that for next season and instead play a 4-3-3 with two more attacking midfielders and one holding. According to ESPN, Solskjaer has already told the players who have returned to training this summer of his plan. The report says that a new central defender is key to the change of tactics, with the club currently chasing Raphael Varane from Real Madrid. Harry Maguire showed during Euro 2020 how good a defender he is and Untied have relied on him a lot since he signed in August 2019. However his partnership with Victor Lindelof has been suspect at times, and has required the 'double pivot' of McTominay and Fred in front of them. Solskjaer hopes Varane's potential transfer would allow him to break up the shield in front of the defence and play the likes of Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba in central midfield together more often. The move could also allow Donny van de Beek to play more often in a position that suits him more, alongside another attacking midfielder rather than instead of them, even though he and Pogba have been linked with moves away from the club. Varane is now the club's first choice target having all but secured the signing of Jadon Sancho, after a transfer saga that's lasted more than a year. The club have already agreed a fee with Borussia Dortmund for the forward and, after his medical was passed, it's just a matter of time until the move is confirmed. United have also been linked with moves for Edouardo Camavinga and Kieran Trippier this summer. ",positive,liverpool,0

But undoubtedly the most memorable moment in the game happened just before the hour mark, as Rooney aimed a wild lunge at his future United teammate after becoming majorly pissed off by Ronaldo's showboating down the left flank. Rooney was having absolutely none of Ronaldo's trickery and promptly introduced him to English football in the best possible way.

They picked the Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium last month as the fixture but to the surprise of many - and definitely Chris and Zac - Ronaldo picked up a ""hip flexor injury"" and was missing from the 4-1 thrashing. The unlucky dad and lad watched on from hospitality and stayed over in a hotel, ultimately costing Â£1500 for the experience. They do say 'third time lucky' and Chris and Zac will have been hoping that was the case when they got some free tickets for United's visit of Leicester City on Saturday. But there was more misery as Ralf Rangnick confirmed Ronaldo missed the 1-1 draw at Old Trafford after suffering from ""flu-like symptoms"". Despite Chris feeling it in his bank balance, he remains determined to make his son's dream come true. âItâs costing an arm and a leg,"" Chris said, as per The Sun.

Loadingâ¦ The 24-year-old has scored five goals in 26 appearances in all competitions this season and has quite clearly not been enjoying his football. Rooney played with a young Rashford for two seasons during the end of his United career and he would inherit the No.10 shirt from him when he departed in 2017. And the Derby County boss, who scored a record 253 goals for United, wants Rashford to going again and surpass his goals tally. ""To get the record and be United's highest goal scorer is f***ing massive,"" Rooney said in an interview with The Sun at a black tie event in Manchester. ""What I hope is that Marcus Rashford f***ing gets his head out of his a*** and goes and breaks that record. He is a Manchester lad."" In the same interview, Rooney revealed his ambitions to become United manager in the future and surprisingly dug out both Cristiano Ronaldo and Rio Ferdinand. He also recalled telling Sir Alex Ferguson to ""f*** off"" when the Scot tried to sign the boyhood Everton fan for United as a 14-year-old. Rashford, meanwhile, has hit 93 goals in 297 appearances for United after bagging a brace on his debut against FC Midtjylland in 2016. He hit a total of 43 goals in the 2019/20 and 2020/21 campaigns but has only started three league games since the turn of the year. His poor performances have resulted in Gareth Southgate dropping him from the England squad for friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast, though the Three Lions is reportedly poised to meet with Rashford to discuss getting him back to his best again.

The Red Devils drew 1-1 with Leicester City at Old Trafford, missing out on the chance to move just one point behind fourth-placed Arsenal. Loadingâ¦ Kelechi Iheanacho put the visitors ahead in the 63rd minute following a dire first half but Fred replied minutes later for United, who saw Scott McTominay avoid a red card for a dangerous challenge on James Maddison. Maddison thought he had put Leicester back in the lead but his goal was chalked off for a foul from Iheanacho on Raphael Varane. United only started playing near the end and had a glorious opening deep in stoppage time when substituted Rashford weaved his way through a couple of challenges. Marcus Rashford tackled by Anthony Elanga in the box pic.twitter.com/TatVOsF6Dq But just as the under fire forward prepared to pull the trigger, an offside Elanga got in his way and kicked Rashford's foot to send him tumbling. Bruno Fernandes and Jadon Sancho had their arms up in the air and appealed for a penalty, not aware that it was Elanga who had fouled his own teammate. Andre Marriner signalled for offside after his linesman put his flag up. The hilarious passage of play encapsulated United in recent times and garnered a lot of reaction on social media. Thought Iâd seen it all this season but Bruno appealing for a penalty after an offside Elanga tackled Rashford to stop him getting the winner is a new low. The sooner this season ends the better.

The former Red Devils boss omitted Rashford in favour of Jack Grealish when he selected his starting XI for England's Euro 2020 opener against Croatia on Sunday. Explaining his decision on talkSPORT, Mourinho said: ""I think Grealish is untouchable and the best position for Grealish is coming from the left which creates a situation which is, for me, Rashford can only play there. ""I think when Rashford plays on the right he is completely lost. His dynamics on the right are totally broken, he doesn't find it. He's very good on the left, attacking spaces.' But Ferdinand didn't agree with Mourinho's comments. The ex-United and England defender told Metro: ""I don't think he looks broken, I just feel that he looks more comfortable on the left-hand side. ""But I'd say the same about [Raheem] Sterling. ""Sterling looks better on the left, Grealish probably looks better on the left. ""I just think it's more about Gareth Southgate talking to the players and making them understand that it's a squad game. ""There's going to be rotation, people are going to play out of position. But for the betterment of the team, make sure we go out there and we're all positive.""  Proud :flag_black: pic.twitter.com/IGoj0OyBqV  Rashford hit 21 goals in all competitions last season but scored just twice in his final 10 games of the campaign. Meanwhile, Ferdinand has urged United not to sign Kieran Trippier this summer. The Atletico Madrid and England right-back has been linked with a switch to Old Trafford to provide competition to Aaron Wan-Bissaka. However, Ferdinand said: ""I don't think they'd buy someone to come in and play [every week], I think whoever's coming in there is going to be playing back-up. ""They spent Â£50 million on Wan-Bissaka, not to be a back-up or number two. ""He [Trippier] wouldn't be my choice if I'm honest, but I see the qualities he has.

England boss Gareth Southgate has some difficult decisions to make ahead of the tournament, which begins on November 21, with there set to be fierce competition for places in his squad. Rashford and Sancho face a battle to be on the plane to Qatar after they were dropped for last monthâs friendlies against Switzerland and the Ivory Coast. Loadingâ¦ But Crouch, who scored 22 goals in 42 appearances for England, believes both players should be included in Southgate's final squad for the tournament. Speculating over potential selection headaches for the England boss, Crouch wrote in The Daily Mail: âThe biggest is Harry Kane's understudy. âTammy Abraham is a shout, a possible wildcard given what he has produced at Roma, as is Ollie Watkins. âYou only need one of those guys behind Kane to offer something different to the rest. But Dominic Calvert-Lewin edges this presently as he loves to attack the sort of crosses our wide men whip in. âAs we sit here now I would also choose Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, on reputation more than anything and a lack of options beneath them. âIf Emile Smith-Rowe is banging them in at Arsenal next season he goes ahead of them, but beyond that there is not quite the depth.â Crouch believes England could play a back three at the tournament, which would allow Southgate to include Kyle Walker, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Reece James in his squad. âHarry Maguire has never let England down either and could benefit from England persisting with a back three,â Crouch added. âI'd go with Kyle Walker on the right of that three personally. It allows us to choose the best trio of right backs as well, with both Reece James and Trent Alexander-Arnold allotted places on Crouch Tours. âAll three are versatile and there are few better in world football.â FIFA is expected to announce that team squads for the World Cup will be expanded to 26 for the tournament in Qatar and Crouch has named Ben White and Conor Gallagher as the two players to benefit, if the change is confirmed. England will come up against the United States, Iran and one of either Scotland, Wales or Ukraine in Group B, and Crouch believes the Three Lions will have no problem reaching the knockout stage of the tournament. Loadingâ¦ âEngland should breeze through and will not be scared of anybody,â he added. âFrance are the only really menacing opposition. You'd prefer to avoid them and it's not ideal that a worst-case scenario could see us play them in the quarter-finals. Let's not think about that.â Goalkeepers: Aaron Ramsdale, Jordan Pickford, Nick Pope Defenders: Kyle Walker, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Reece James, Harry Maguire, John Stones, Conor Coady, Luke Shaw, Ben Chilwell Midfielders: Declan Rice, Kalvin Phillips, Jude Bellingham, Jordan Henderson, Mason Mount Forwards: Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka, Jack Grealish, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho Extra two: Conor Gallagher, Ben White Possible wildcards: Emile Smith-Rowe, James Maddison ",positive,liverpool,0

Footage of the breathtaking goal, scored by Ruud van Nistelrooy against Valencia, has gone viral on social media and is quite rightly receiving a lot of love. In 12 perfect passes, Real went from one end to the other in devastating fashion to go 1-0 up at the Santiago Bernabeu. Loadingâ¦ As well as Van Nistelrooy, who produced an outstanding volleyed finish at the far post, Michel Salgado, Mahamadou Diarra, Gonzalo Higuain, Robinho, Fernando Gago and Miguel Torres were all heavily involved. Iker Casillas had passed the ball out from a goal kick and Los Blancos were enjoying a steady spell of possession But when Salgado put a ball into the channel for Van Nistelrooy to chest downwards, that's where the one-touch magic commenced. One touch play from Real Madrid finished off by Ruud.Utter perfection. :ok_hand: pic.twitter.com/nZQDPRwwVu Higuain and Diarra played a one-two, the former then shifting it on to Robinho, who produced a lovely first-time flick for Gago.

After Scoring Header In France Training, It Brings Back Childhood Memories","Let's kick this article off with a nostalgic question. As a kid, what player's name did you call out as you rifled home a screamer from range? For many of you reading this, the name ""ROOONEY!"" will have been uttered when the ball was walloped â or perhaps the screams of ""GERRRARD!"" echoed around your local park or playground. Other honourable mentions from the world of football include Thierry Henry, Alan Shearer and for the youngsters out there, Kevin De Bruyne. But what about Harry Kane? Step forward, Antoine Griezmann. In a training session ahead of France's friendly against South Africa on Tuesday night, Griezmann chanelled his inner Harry Kane when he netted a perfectly-placed header past Hugo Lloris in goal. And after the ball hit the back of the net, the Atletico Madrid loanee proceeded to celebrate by shouting: ""Wheyyyyy. Harry Kane!"" It was a moment that got social media talking. Why did Griezmann say Harry Kane? ð­ pic.twitter.com/Fcmw7aYL5d One Twitter user commented: ""Griezmann is playing with Mbappe literally tonight but shouts 'Harry Kane' when he scores. Yet Iâm meant to believe Mbappe is the best player in the world not Kane?"" Another said: ""Even Griezmann is being influenced by Kane. Heâs actually massive."" A third wrote: ""Antoine Griezmann shouting ""HARRY KANE"" in a Scouse accent after scoring in training is the content you didn't know you needed today."" Griezmann has a Football Manager-related connection with the Premier League. Last year, the French forward revealed that he lifted five trophies with Newcastle after signing Kylian Mbappe for â¬134m. The 31-year-old, who is often seen playing FM while on international duty, was getting stuck into the Sports Interactive game ahead of last summer'sEuropean Championship. In a video filmed on France's official channels, Griezmann can be seen on a plane with his laptop out while talking to colleague andfellow FM super-fan Ousmane Dembeleabout his achievements.

105,https://www.sportbible.com/football/transfers-news-barcelona-didnt-tell-antoine-griezmann-about-transfer-talks-20210716,Antoine Griezmann Wasn't Told About Transfer Negotiations Between Barcelona And Atletico Madrid,"Barcelona's attempts to send Antoine Griezmann back to Atletico Madrid have been complicated by the fact the club didn't tell the player negotiations had started. Loadingâ¦ Griezmann moved from Atletico to Barcelona in 2019, a year after he was originally expected to leave for the Nou Camp, but things haven't worked out as well as expected. Lionel Messi's potential departure suggested that the France forward might get a starring role in the side, in his preferred role, but things have no changed. The former Atleti star was reportedly going to be sacrificed if Messi signed a new deal and as soon as reports came out that the six time Ballon d'Or winner had agreed a new contract it was reported that Barca were negotiating with their rivals to swap Griezmann for Saul Niguez. However it seems that the forward wasn't in the loop, with RMC journalist Loic Tanzi reporting that Griezmann wasn't told about the negotiations. Tanzi also says that the gap in the salary that the former Real Sociedad forward gets at Barcelona and the one he'd get at Atletico is 'significant.' Barca need to trim their wage bill in order to register their new signings, which includes Sergio Aguero and Memphis Depay, and Messi had to agree a 50% wage cut. Whether or not the Catalan giants could afford to pay some of their potentially departing player's wages in order to help grease the wheels of the move remains to be seen. The 30-year-old was also linked with a move to Chelsea, with the Premier League club desperate to add a striker this summer. The Blues have been strongly linked with moves for Harry Kane and Erling Haaland, with a bid for the latter reportedly having been rejected. Dortmund do not want to sell Haaland this summer, despite the fact he can leave for Â£75 million in a years time, having already agreed to sell Jadon Sancho. A swap back Atletico makes more sense for Griezmann, as he would likely still return a hero, despite leaving in the first place. Saul moving in the opposite direction would also make sense, with the midfielder having already fallen down Diego Simeone's pecking order before Rodrigo de Paul signed this week.

Another commented: ""David Beckham could not dribble but more than made up for it with is fitness, passing, crossing, positioning and shooting.

Kepa has managed four clean sheets in seven starts since Mendy linked up with his Senegal teammates for AFCON, which Aliou Cisseâs men won last Sunday.

However,ESPNreports that Chelsea boss Tuchel is âseriously considering replacingâ Kepa with Mendy for the Club World Cup final against Palmeiras on Saturday. Mendy, 29, returned to Chelseaâs Ritz-Carlton hotel base on Wednesday afterSenegal beat Egypt on penalties in the AFCON final. Chelseaâs coaching staff has acknowledged âkey improvementsâ Kepa has made in recent months, but he could still be axed from Stamford Bridge going forward. Kepa has âresponded wellâ to the idea of altering his goalkeeping style by adopting a âmore aggressiveâ approach and âavoiding the temptation to retreatâ to his line, according to ESPN. Read More: But the publication believes the former Bilbao âkeeper is âfacing a fight to save his Chelsea career,â even after impressing Chelseaâs coaching staff. ESPN reports that Kepaâs lack of playing time at Chelsea with the return of Mendy means the club are âwilling to listen to offers for the Spaniard.â Kepaâs current contract with Chelsea expires in 2025, with the Spanish shot-stopper earning Â£150,000-a-week wages at the club.

Loadingâ¦ Arrizabalaga has fallen down the pecking order since his Â£72 million move in 2019 and is second choice to Edouard Mendy. The 26-year-old didn't go away with Spain to Euro 2020 and has reported to the club's Cobham training base. In a clip posted to social media, Arrizabalaga passed the time by completing the crossbar challenge with complete ease. Takes some skill to be that accurate so consistently. Arrizabalaga arrived from Athletic Bilbao as one of the world's top, young goalkeepers. His talent on the ball has never been questioned but he's failed to impress between the sticks at Stamford Bridge. Fans have reacted to the clip and they've joked Arrizabalaga should try playing outfield for a while. One commented: ""Would've been a better striker option than Alvaro Morata for 17/18 tbf."" A second added: ""Maybe we should play him upfront instead of Timo Werner."" Someone said: ""Ronaldinho: Am I a joke to you?"" While another simply put: ""The difficulty in this, Kepa is no joke!"" A move to Lazio has been mooted for Arrizabalaga, who made just 12 appearances for the Blues last season. Frank Lampard and Thomas Tuchel both preferred Mendy, who started in May's Champions League final win over Manchester City. Chelsea finished fourth in the Premier League and are looking to replenish their squad. Borussia Dortmund forward Erling Haaland is their key target but a move doesn't look likely this summer. They're also set to trim their squad to fund their new signings, but supporters are NOT happy with the latest outgoing. According to David Ornstein, Crystal Palace are close to completing the permanent signing of Marc Guehi in a deal worth a reported Â£20 million. The 21-year-old defender, who starred for Swansea City last season, is set to pen a five-year deal at Selhurst Park. Chelsea do have a sell-on clause as well as matching rights for a future transfer, but it's yet another young prospect leaving in search of action.

United were held to a frustrating 1-1 draw at Old Trafford on Saturday after Southampton striker Che Adams cancelled out Jadon Sanchoâs early goal for the Red Devils. United looked for a winner in the second half and thought they had it when Cristiano Ronaldo headed in from a free-kick. Loadingâ¦ But the goal was swiftly ruled out by the linesman, with replays showing that Ronaldo and five other Manchester United players were in an offside position when the ball was delivered. A still shot of the set piece has now gone viral on social media. âHow does this happen? It makes zero sense,â wrote one fan on Twitter. âDonât have a brain in their heads,â added another. âVAR is going to have to check this oneâ pic.twitter.com/lI3adL09vI A third wrote: âShows the football IQ of our team that they wasted a few minutes arguing this with the ref in a game we were chasing a goal.â Other fans direction their anger at Eric Ramsay, who was appointed as Manchester Unitedâs first set piece specialist last summer. One fan wrote on Twitter: âOur âset piece coachâ is worth his weight in gold!â Another added sarcastically: âErIc RaMsAy Is GoNnA iMpRoVe Us In SeT pIeCeS."" Donât have a brain in their heads The most irritating thing about this was the players moaning to the ref like they were hard done by. Happens time and time again and its getting tiresome. Bruno, Maguire and Ronaldo regular culprits ð´ How can these players be so clueless on the pitch?? This is the epitome of how poor we're at doing the simple things at the moment ð© Manchester United have scored just one league goal from a set piece this season, despite the appointment of Ramsay. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick was recently asked about that damning statistic and admitted it was âweirdâ. ""In the end, this is a question of training time but is also a question of deliveries,"" he said. ""And this is really a little bit weird, to be honest, because we players who should be technically able to deliver the balls in the right way.â ",negative,liverpool,0

Loadingâ¦ âKepa, who was drafted into the cup final late in extra time,blazed his penalty way over the bar to hand Liverpool victory at Wembley Stadium last weekend. Thomas Tuchel's decision to bring on the Spanish keeper completely backfired, with a Liverpool supporter poking fun at the player when he picked up his runner-up medal. AsKepaâ collected his medal and walked up the steps a Liverpool fan taunted him as he left the royal box. In a very, very strong scouse accent, the fan said:""Good job they brought you on there lad, good job they brought you on.""â Tuchel, though, refused to blame the 27-year-old for his side's 11-10 shootout defeat to Jurgen Klopp's team. Instead, he shouldered the blame as he introduced the goalkeeper specifically for the penalties. Speaking after losing the first major domestic final of the season, he explained:""Do you think we do this and don't talk to the players? The players know the plan and we have done it beforeâ ""If you want to blame somebody, blame me; this is not a problem. ""I take the decisions and I don't take them to try to be the hero. Today it took 11 penalties to find the winner. And if you want to blame anyone blame me, there's no problem."" Kepa has only played 14 games this term, mainly featuring in the Carabao Cup. But he was snubbed of a starting spot, with Tuchel preferringEdouard Mendyâ. ",negative,liverpool,4
