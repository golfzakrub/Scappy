https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-shortlist-fulfil-steven-23843979,Aston Villa shortlist to fulfil Steven Gerrard's biggest summer transfer priority,"Ahead of his first summer in charge of Aston Villa, Steven Gerrard has revealed his biggest priority as we approach the transfer window, which could be fulfilled by any of these four targets. Villa were linked with midfielders such as Rodrigo Bentancur and Yves Bissouma in the January window but a move failed to materialise. Moving into the summer, Gerrard has outlined the priority for his recruitment team as he looks to bolster the midfield options within his squad, as he aims to sign a player capable of playing as a 'number six' this summer. Speaking on the impact a signing such as this could have on current Villa midfielder John McGinn, Gerrard stated: ""John likes to be a bit more of a free spirit. But it was a priority in the last window to make a six happen but we couldn’t possibly do that, it wasn’t right, the timing wasn’t right. READ MORE:   Danny Ings gives 'underwhelming' Aston Villa verdict READ MORE: Philippe Coutinho has made feelings clear on Aston Villa transfer ""So we have to be patient for the right thing in the long run. But with different personnel around John we’re hoping to give him some more freedom."" A player ahead of the defence to offer both an added layer of security but also help progress the team is clearly at the top of the list for Gerrard, so here is four players he could sign to fill this void in the squad: Boubacar Kamara Christian Purslow (chief executive), Johan Lange (sporting director) and Gerrard himself were all present for Olympique de Marseille's fixture against Nantes recently to watch the Boubacar Kamara, who will be out of contract come the end of the season. The 22-year-old offers the composure, defensive instinct and reading of the game to perfectly orchestrate and solidify the midfielder for Gerrard's side. However, the club will likely face a line of competitors queuing up to secure his long-term future this summer given his talents. Christian Norgaard No player across Europe's top five leagues has made more tackles than Brentford's Christian Norgaard (121), with the player also ranking sixth in midfield pressures (349). He clearly offers a reinforcement defensively but can also be relied upon to progress the team forward with just under five progressive passes per game averaged. Villa have dealt with Brentford before whilst bringing Ollie Watkins and Ezri Konsa to the club and could look to delve into their pool of talent once again here to sign the 28-year-old Danish international. Kalvin Phillips The 26-year-old England international is valued at around £60 million by Leeds United and it comes as no surprise given the services he offers within the midfield. Both Villa and Manchester United have been credited with an interest in the player but could see the price tag drastically reduced if Leeds do drop into the Championship this summer, given the likelihood that Phillips would actively pursue a move away from the club if they did drop into the second tier of English football. Phillips ranks in the top one percent of midfielder across Europe's top five leagues for pressures (30) and the top three percent for blocks (2.5) and tackles (3.8), outlining the clear benefit signing him would have on Gerrard's current midfield. Wilfred Ndidi In terms of players who would anchor the midfield and allow the talent to thrive around him, it would be hard to find someone better suited to the role than Leicester City's Wilfred Ndidi. The 25-year-old Nigerian midfielder ranks in the top ten percent for aerials won (2.6) per game, clearances (3.4), interceptions (2.7) and tackles (4.2) across Europe and Villa would have to pay a price in the region of £50 million if they were to acquire a player of this calibre. Commenting on the rumours linking him with a move in the summer, Ndidi stated: “At the moment I am enjoying myself in Leicester,"" he replied. My family is here. My business degree is on hold. There was lockdown and then my daughter was born. I am looking forward to it maybe next year.” ",positive,manchester united,1

https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-pedro-neto-premier-league-23841284,Wolves star makes 'difficult' admission about European chances after Brighton defeat,"Wolverhampton Wanderers attacker Pedro Neto admits that it will be ""difficult"" for the team to qualify for Europe next season after suffering a heavy defeat in the Premier League at the weekend. Brighton trounced Wolves 3-0 at Molineux on Saturday. A first-half penalty from Alexis McAllister was followed up by goals from Leandro Trossard and Yves Bissouma after the interval. An impressive first half of the season put Wolves in a great position to finish in the top seven and challenge for European qualification. They even looked capable of potentially posing a serious threat to the top four. HEADLINES: Despair for Bruno Lage after Wolves' damaging defeat to Brighton dents European ambitions REACTION: Bruno Lage slams players for 'watching' Brighton in worst Wolves game A string of bad results has quietened those hopes, however. Bruno Lage's men have won just three times in their last ten Premier League games. There is still a decent chance that the club may qualify for one of Uefa's competitions next season, though. They are just three points behind seventh-placed West Ham with a game in hand, and both the Hammers and Manchester United have been in poor form of late. While Neto admits that their chances have been hampered, he says the team will continue fighting ""to achieve our goals"". In order to do that, the Portuguese believes that the team have to do better in terms of chance creation and finishing in front of goal. “When you have your goals, you want to achieve them. We want European football, we are working to that, but the last three games we were not happy,” he told the club’s official website. “We have to create more, we have to score more goals. We are looking to work on that, finishing the best way. “It was not a happy day for us. The last three games were not what we had in our mind. We have a lot to fight for. It’s becoming difficult but we have to continue to work to achieve our goals. “I understand the frustration of the fans. We are here to fight, to work each day. Things are not happening, but we will continue to work to get the victory in the next game.” ",negative,manchester united,1

They also made it clear there would be no news on season ticket prices until the report was received. But fans already angry at being excluded from areas of the ground were left further frustrated by the latest statement, claiming there was no real update. One supporter joked: ""I don't know what's going to be released first, the Stand Report or the Sue Gray report [on Boris Johnson and Partygate]. We just keep getting told we must wait for both. How long do the club want??"" Another said: ""What a pointless update. Probably took longer to go through the approval process than to put this together."" A third added: ""Cheers for the update to tell us u will update us once u have an update on the update we’re waiting for."" Read the full story Birmingham City have reportedly identified Forest Green Rovers boss Rob Edwards as a potential replacement for Lee Bowyer. The Sun report that Edwards is on the 'wanted list' of Blues and Salford City, the League Two club owned by Gary Neville and his former Manchester United team-mates. It is being claimed that Blues could look for a 'successor' to Bowyer with Edwards' attractive style of play earning admirers elsewhere having steered Rovers to promotion to League One this season. Uncertainty around Bowyer 's future continues as a disappointing campaign nears a conclusion with Blues only two places above the relegation zone in 20th with a game to play. Twentieth position is where Blues are almost certain to end the campaign given they are three points behind Cardiff City a place above them after a 1-1 draw in the Welsh capital on Saturday. When Reading and Derby County's points deductions are not taken into account, Blues would be outside the relegation zone on goal difference heading into the final day of the season. Before the Cardiff game Bowyer confirmed that he had spoken to technical director Craig Gardner but not with Blues' hierarchy. Read the full story here Birmingham City fans have reacted cautiously to national media reports claiming a League Two manager has been identified as a potential replacement for Lee Bowyer at St Andrew's. The reports suggest Forest Green manager Rob Edwards is on the ""wanted list"" of Blues after he led the Gloucestershire outfit into League One with promotion from the fourth tier. The Green Devils have spent just four years in the English Football League, but have become a clear promotion contender by winning 23 games and losing eight times so far. One supporter said: ""As much as Lee Bowyer has made mistakes this season, I still believe he could turn our fortunes around with a new owner, some financial stability and backing...otherwise it's groundhog day again."" Another added: ""Don't matter how attractive his football is,we need to buy players that can play attractive football."" A third said: ""Good young manager. but why would he want to come to us with our owners when he has got a good owner at Forest Green? And anyway, Lee Bowyer is our manager and I hope he is next season."" ",positive,manchester united,1

https://www.football365.com/news/romano-reveals-liverpool-ready-transfer-tchouameni-monaco-manchester-united-chelsea,"Romano reveals Liverpool ‘ready to make their move’ for Man Utd, Chelsea-linked midfielder","Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Liverpool are prepared to go big to bring Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni to the club this summer. Tchouameni has been coveted by a number of clubs around Europe with both Manchester United and Chelsea linked in recent months. The 22-year-old has played at every age group for France from under-16 all the way up to under-21 before making his first senior appearance in September last year. Would this season be a success if Liverpool won one out of four from here? Tchouameni completed a move from Bordeaux to Monaco in 2020 and has scored six goals in 92 appearances in all competitionsfor theMonégasques, from a mainly defensive midfield position. And now Liverpool – who have put a brilliant squad together in recent years – are ready to bid for the Frenchman this summer, according to Romano, with the Reds “targeting a new midfielder”. “Aurelien Tchouameni is certainly a player being monitored by Liverpool,”Romano wrote on Anfield Watch. “Who have had conversations with the agent of the Monaco midfielder. However, the €45 million price tag – set last summer – is no longer valid. A far higher offer will be needed to prise Tchouameni away from France. “But the 22-year-old is planning for a different experience this summer and that is undoubtedly why Liverpool may be ready to make their move. However, Real Madrid has been following Tchouameni for some time, and the Reds will face competition from other top clubs interested in the French international.” A deal for Fulham attacking midfielder Fabio Carvalho, which collapsed on deadline day in January, is understood to be close with Liverpool to pay “around£5m plus £2.7m in add-ons”. Romano added: “Klopp will also be involved in all the transfer decisions in the coming months and he has already given his green light for the signing of Fulham’sFabio Carvalho. The deal is already closed, the paperwork has been completed in recent days and there is no doubt: Carvalho will soon be announced as the first new signing of the 2022/2023 season, with a long-term contract until June 30, 2027. “The Portuguese talent has already been to the AXA Training Centre to meet with Klopp and he extensively explored Liverpool’s facilities before completing a medical – with Fulham’s permission. “Liverpool will pay around £5m plus £2.7m in add-ons, including a sell-on clause for 20% of Carvalho’s future sale. Liverpool faced competition from other clubs, who had tried to enter the race for his signature in February following the collapsed deal between Liverpool and Fulham on Deadline Day, for reasons of time in completing the contract. “But Carvalho has respected his agreement with the Reds, and the club themselves have an excellent relationship with Fulham after agreeing to keep the terms of the agreement reached in January instead of signing Carvalho on a free transfer this summer. The move has been particularly appreciated at Craven Cottage and future ties between the clubs are likely to be friendly. “Carvalho’s programme for the future is very clear: as things stand there is no planned return to Fulham on loan next season. Liverpool intend to keep Carvalho in the first team and consider him part of the group, but the final confirmation will come during pre-season after Klopp has the chance to assess his new midfielder.” ",positive,manchester united,1
https://www.football365.com/news/ravanelli-spurs-premier-league-title-conte-manchester-united-new-defence,Ravanelli claims Spurs can win title next season and Man Utd need a ‘whole new defence’,"Fabrizio Ravanelli reckons Spurs can win the Premier League title next season but admits they will have to “fight hard” to achieve that under Antonio Conte. Tottenham have been much better in the second half of the campaign under Conte with the Italian replacing Nuno Espirito Santo at the beginning of November. Nuno left the club after they lost five of his last seven Premier League matches in charge with Spurs sitting ninth in the Premier League. Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Tottenham are now up to fifth under Conte, two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal with the race for the final Champions League spot well underway. And Middlesbrough legend Ravanelli reckons Spurs have a chance of winning the Premier League title next season with Conte at the helm. Ravanelli told The Sun: “I believe he has been doing very well at Tottenham but when a coach, especiallyConte, gets to a team, he needs time. I’m pretty sure he can make tremendous progress and achieve exactly what he has in mind. “Tottenhamhas always been missing something – they never really manage to take that necessary step forward in quality. They have had a good mentality but it’s not been effective in getting the results they want. “Now withConte and Fabio Paratici, they will be able to make the right choices to give them the right identity to win. They will be able to then possibly win thePremier Leaguein this way. Next year will be the turning point.” Ravanelli added: “This year they have less chance than Arsenal [to get top four] but knowing Conte, in these moments, he always wins duels. He is so focused and so determined and I’m pretty sure they will finish fourth and get into the Champions League. “As for winning the Premier League next year, they will have to fight hard. We cannot forget Manchester City and Liverpool. Tottenham have got seven or eight excellent players. “They need to focus on the defence because that is their main weakness. They would also need to strengthen the midfield with new signings and sign a new striker to play alongside Harry Kane. “Kane is the best but he is not enough so they will need to strengthen there next season. It won’t be easy.” Conte was linked with the Man Utd job before taking over at Spurs and Ravanelli reckons the Red Devils need huge changes in the summer to progress under Erik ten Hag. Ravanelli continued: “If Conte had had the possibility to work with theManchester Unitedplayers, certainly it would have been easier for him to achieve certain results. “United have many players who are not fit to wear the shirt or up to the expectation of winning the Premier League and Champions League. There should be some turnover of players. “I don’t want to be nasty but honest. Without naming specific players, the whole defence should be changed completely. It needs radical change. “I truly believe withErik ten Hag, a new cycle is about to start. He did really well at Ajax and enjoyed remarkable results. “He has always given great value to young players. If he starts working with the young players who understand what it means to play for United, they can make the difference and improve.” ",positive,manchester united,1

The stars in question are James-Ward-Prowse and Jarrod Bowen. The latter has been linked with Liverpool in recent months. Bowen has been one of West Ham’s standout players this term both domestically and in Europe. He has grabbed 16 goals and eleven assists from his 47 outings across all competitions.

He has contributed nine goals and five assists in the Premier League. Spanish outlet Fichajes are reporting that Ward-Prowse and Bowen are ‘covered by Ten Hag for his Man Utd.’ Ward-Prowse is ‘one of the first names’ on the Dutchman’s ‘agenda’, while it is noted that Bowen has been one of the ‘main Premier League revelations’ in recent seasons. The report adds that Ten Hag is also an admirer of Feyenoord left-back Tyrell Malacia who is rated at around€15m. Elsewhere, Gary Neville has insisted that Ten Hag should be expected to win the Premier League title in the fourth year of his reign at Man Utd. The Dutchman was confirmed as the new permanent Red Devils boss last month with interim manager Ralf Rangnick making way at the end of the season. “I said four to five years to win a title and I don’t disagree with Jamie’s timeline of Champions League in the first two seasons while he’s sorting the recruitment out and getting used to the club. “Third season getting very close, I think to the point whereby the club have got confidence and won a trophy maybe. “And then that fourth year really is where they have to win a title, fifth year. That’s where I think really you’re looking at the moment realistically. “We all hope he comes in and blows everyone away and that Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola blow up somehow. “But they’re not blowing up are they? They’re achieving the same numbers of points year in year out so if their consistency remains, which there’s no reason to say it won’t then Ten Hag’s got a massive job to make up that points gap.” ",positive,manchester united,1

The Spaniard produced a good performance for the Red Devils on Monday as they beat Brentford 3-0 at Old Trafford with goals coming from Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane. Mata was making his first Premier League start of the campaign with the 34-year-old starting just three of his ten appearances in all competitions this term. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? The decision by interim boss Rangnick to start Mata frustrated Man Utd legend Keane who thinks the German is “giving players a run-out for the wrong reasons”. “I’m surprised. It’s his first start of the season, he obviously knows he’s leaving the club. There’s some loyalty there, giving him a run-out. “He came on for 20 minutes the other night but starting a game is much different. It tells you where the mindset is. They are giving players a run-out for the wrong reasons.” 🗣 “I’m surprised.” Roy Keane says he wasn’t expecting Juan Mata to start over Marcus Rashford this evening for Manchester United. pic.twitter.com/MYVJQzJ9BS — Football Daily (@footballdaily) May 2, 2022 But Rangnick was pleased with Mata’s performance against Brentford and when asked whether he could’ve used him more often, the Man Utd boss replied:“Yes, maybe it was the first game he played from the beginning, [but it] also had to do with the opposition in this position and in the last couple of weeks he was one of the players who showed in training how professional he is and how much he loves the game. “He had moments when he played like a magician.” Mata is out of contract at Man Utd at the end of the season and looks almost certain that he will leave the club in the summer. On Mata’s future, Rangnick added: “I don’t know [if he’s leaving]. He hasn’t confirmed that but it is possible. “It was an important night for players who have been here quite a long time and played well for the club.” Phil Jones, who has also struggled for game time in recent seasons, got on the pitch for the final 15 minutes in what is likely to be his Old Trafford farewell with Man Utd finishing the season with away trips to Brighton and Crystal Palace. “For personal reasons he didn’t train a lot, yesterday was the first,” said Rangnick of Jones. “He asked me to allow him some time at home.

The former Republic of Ireland international played 480 times for the Red Devils over 13 seasons, winning seven Premier League titles, four FA Cups and a Champions League. He played alongside a number of amazing players during his time at Old Trafford and Sky Sports asked him to pick hisgreatest Man Utd XI of the Premier League era on their Monday Night Football show. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? Keane decided on a team of Peter Schmeichel; Gary Neville, Gary Pallister, Jaap Stam, Denis Irwin; David Beckham, Paul Ince, Bryan Robson, Ryan Giggs; Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo. And the Man Utd legend explained his decision to make Schmeichel the goalkeeper despite him not being “as good as everyone thought”. “I don’t like upsetting my team-mates,” Keane said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football. “I had to leave out some brilliant players, brilliant characters, but obviously I’ve done it. Edwin [Van der Sar] was nearly a sparring partner. “Goalkeepers get too much praise when they make a save. I had to go with Peter because he was very, very good – not as good as everyone thought, but very good. “And obviously, I have good memories with him. He was a good character in the dressing room – me and Peter certainly weren’t the best of mates, absolutely far from it, but the most important thing I had for Peter – and all of my team-mates – was huge respect. “He produced big moments and helped us get over the line in big matches, that’s the bottom line. Before you go into any match, you look over your shoulder at who’s in goal and you go, ‘yeah, I’m happy with him – we’ve got a chance.’ Peter would produce and help us get trophies.” Keane selected Stam and Pallister as his two centre-backs but he felt harsh leaving Ferdinand and Steve Bruce out of his XI. The former midfielder added: “Centre-back was probably the hardest one because Rio was excellent, Brucey was a good character. I just couldn’t leave Jaap Stam out. He didn’t play as many games as the other lads but he was big, strong, brave, brilliant at one-on-ones. “The other one was an issue but I’ve gone with Gary Pallister. I’d probably say [it was between Pallister and] Rio. Rio was obviously a good athlete and read the game well but my relationship with Pally was pretty good as well. “Did [Stam] have any real weaknesses? He could head it, he could leap, he could read the game, he was strong, aggressive, a decent lad. I got on really well with him. Unfortunately you try to move on, but Jaap was a brilliant player for Man United. Brucey was a good player and a brilliant player.” “We’d obviously play with a high line!” 🤣 David Beckham 🌟 Rooney 🙌 @GNev2 👀 Roy Keane reveals his ULTIMATE Man Utd Premier League XI 🤩 pic.twitter.com/7nhb19EljG — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 2, 2022 Scholes and Nicky Butt were two more Man Utd legends to miss out on Keane’s team but he just couldn’t see past Robson and Ince in centre midfield. Keane continued: “I’m certainly not going to pick myself. Bryan Robson has to go in there. Bryan was a great player for Man United, full of courage, scored some big goals for the club when Man United weren’t at their best. I had some brilliant days with Butty and Scholesy. “Next to Robbo, I’m going to put Paul Ince. Incey was a very, very good player. Maybe he tarnished his United reputation; he ended up playing at Liverpool or wherever. When he was at United, there was all talk of Incey being the governor. “People kind of held that against him but that was just banter, there was no nastiness with that. Incey was a really good teammate and a very good team-mate.” On leaving Cantona out, Keane said: “Eric was a brilliant player for Man United. I’m upset to leave Eric out.

After his spells at Real Madrid and Juventus, Ronaldo returned to the Red Devils last summer. A fee of around £13.5m plus add-ons was paid by Man Utd. The forward has been criticised by some this season but he has been one of few bright sparks for United. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong The 37-year-old scored his 24th goal of the season on Monday night as Man Utd beat Brentford 3-0 at Old Trafford. Carragher has often questioned United’s decision to re-sign Ronaldo and he did so again on Monday. He does not feel that they “should not be buying a 37-year-old”: “My problem has always been with Man United for buying Cristiano Ronaldo. One of the biggest clubs in the world should not be buying a 37-year-old,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “I’ve always been of the opinion that they should move him on, but right now, there are so many problems – ‘I need to get a midfielder, I need to get a centre-back.’ We’ve seen this season that when Ronaldo doesn’t play or gets brought off, it’s a massive story. “If you bring in strikers, are they to play or back up Ronaldo? If you’re the new manager, you might think you don’t need that on your plate. “They’ve got other problems. Would Liverpool ring back Luis Suarez? I don’t think so. United should be getting Erling Haaland. Man City are getting him. “It’s like United are a small club. It’s like when Rooney went back to Everton. It was just to lift the fans.” Carragher also thinks it’s “nonsense” that Ralf Rangnick will be managing Austria next season. The former Liverpool defender said on Sky Sports: “Ralf Rangnick isn’t really a manager, he’s a director of football, he’s someone who helps the coaches or builds the club. “I’ll be honest with you I just don’t get that. I don’t think you can be manager of Austria and work for Manchester United. “He can work for Manchester United in that role…well that’s wrong.

The Englishman is out of contract this summer and he has barely featured for the Red Devils this season. Newcastle United attempted to sign him in January but Man Utd’s hierarchy prevented this deal from happening. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? It was reported on Monday afternoon that AC Milan and Juventus are ‘leading the chase’ to sign Lingard on a free transfer. The 29-year-old was an unused substitute as United beat Brentford 3-0 on Monday night. Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane got the goals. After the game, Lingard’s brother – Louie Scott – took to Instagram to criticise United for their treatment of the midfielder: “20 years of blood sweat and tears, four domestic trophies, three cup final goals, not even a farewell. No wonder it’s Conference League next year,” Scott said (quotes via The Mirror). “Attacking players for celebrations when the club’s being sold to the super league OK. “Class of ’92, Busby Babes, you’re run by people who don’t even know the offside trap.

The Dutchman was confirmed as the new permanent Red Devils boss last month with interim manager Ralf Rangnick making way at the end of the season.

They’re going to reinvest, get players in and get stronger. “Klopp might stay on, Pep might stay on. It comes down to recruitment: getting the right players in and getting players out of the door, because the last few years just haven’t been good enough. “How many times can you say it?

Even when he’s playing through the middle, I said he plays like a child [againstLiverpool]. “It’s like he’s not learnt from the game.

Neville told Sky Sports: “The Austrian national team has pride, great country and some great players so he’ll have to watch players all week then he’s going to go and coach them for two weeks in September, October, November and March. So you’re saying to yourself what’s happening with the Manchester United consultancy advice? “Where is the priority? There’s a conflict there.” Neville added: “I don’t see that. I don’t see how that can work, you’re a national team manager and I’ve worked under a national team manager, that national team manager has got to present week in, week out, Saturday, Wednesday, Saturday, Tuesday and he can’t be here at Old Trafford every week watching an Austrian player play. “I can’t see how that’s going to work, if it’s something that’s true. Maybe (it’s a compromise) but it’s messy, Manchester United can’t afford at this moment to have distractions, can’t afford at this moment in time to have a poor communications plan around the idea that Ralf Rangnick’s our football consultant but he’s seen watching German football three times a month then going coaching the Austrian team two times a month. “That’s not going to work because people are going to say ‘hang on, who’s in the director’s box? What’s Darren Fletcher doing? What’s John Murtough doing? What’s Ralf Rangnick doing wherever he’s watching an Austrian player? “I don’t think they can afford that at this moment in time.

Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane netted for Man Utd on a rare night of joy for Rangnick. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? The interim manager’s inability to get a consistent tune out of the squad means they are set to miss out on Champions League qualification and he admitted he was disappointed that they did not play like that more often. “I think tonight we probably showed one of our best performances in the last six months in possession of the ball,” Rangnick said. “We were in control of the game in most parts. We still had a few gaps defensively but in general I was pleased with the performance we showed tonight. “The season is not yet over, we have another two games to play away at Brighton and Crystal Palace. “We have to divide (my time) into different parts. We had very good games, very good performance to start with and in-between, the home games against West Ham, Tottenham, away at Leeds. “But what we lacked in general was just consistency. At times we had problems to score goals. We scored three today, we scored four against Leeds. “To start with it was important to stabilise the team and help them to concede not that many goals, but what was lacking was consistency. “We also lost quite a few important players. This also didn’t help us. “Obviously I am not completely happy with those six months. I would have expected us to qualify for Champions League. This was the goal that we had but in the end we were just not consistent enough.” Old Trafford said farewell to Rangnick and midfielder Nemanja Matic on Monday, with Juan Mata and Edinson Cavani also featuring before their expected summer exits. Rangnick admits he made a mistake in only handing Mata his first league start of the season on Monday – a night when fellow veteran Ronaldo shone in another man-of-the-match display. The 37-year-old moved onto 18 league goals for the season and his future will be of keen interest this summer as Erik ten Hag prepares to take over. “The way that he played again tonight, not only because he scored a goal, he also won the penalty, he also helped defensively tonight,” Rangnick said. “So, why should he not be a player that could still be part of the squad and help the team? “This is a question you have to ask Erik once he’s here and obviously it’s also important how Cristiano sees his role and his position.” Our last game of the season at Old Trafford.

Monday marked a year since the postponement of the Red Devils’ home clash against Liverpool, when fans made their anger at the ownership clear in the wake of the European Super League debacle. F365 says: Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong Supporters have protested at each of United’s final three home games and the anti-Glazer sentiment was clear before and during the victory against Brentford at Old Trafford. This was the first match that Thomas Frank’s Bees had lost with Christian Eriksen in the starting line-up and there were times before and after Bruno Fernandes’ early opener that the Dane threatened to unlock the hosts. A narrow offside decision denied Cristiano Ronaldo before half-time, but the veteran would get on the scoresheet after converting the spot-kick foolishly given away by Rico Henry. Raphael Varane hooked home a deflected third as fans gave standing ovations to departing Nemanja Matic and Juan Mata as they were substituted on their final Old Trafford appearances. There were renewed chants against the Glazers in the 73rd minute, when a few departed rather than the mass exodus planned ahead of a huge summer in every department at United. Brentford may find the scoreline hard to swallow given the impressive moments they showed during their first competitive match at Old Trafford since 1975. Eriksen pulled the strings from the outset and put Bryan Mbeumo behind dozy Alex Telles in the opening seconds of a match that saw the Stretford End applaud the Denmark international at their first corner. Brentford played with confidence under the Old Trafford floodlights but United would strike an early blow, with Diogo Dalot sending Anthony Elanga scampering down the right. The 20-year-old – one of few bright spots for United this term – fizzed over a cross that Fernandes crashed home in the ninth minute. Eriksen attempted to catch out David De Gea with a snapshot when Brentford returned to the attack and provided a brilliant cross that Ivan Toney headed over from close range. While the Brentford playmaker probed, Ronaldo was proving a handful at the other end. From backheels to forcing David Raya into an awkward save from a long-range free-kick, then furiously claiming he should have had a penalty following Mads Bech Sorensen’s challenge. Referee Chris Kavanagh was unmoved. Next Ronaldo smartly flicked into Mata, who lashed narrowly wide of the near post on his first Premier League start of the season. Mbeumo flashed wide as the Bees swarmed forward and Eriksen continued to impress, only for United to celebrate a second. Mata broke down the left and sent a low cross that Ronaldo squeezed past Raya. Provider and scorer celebrated together, only for the goal to be ruled out following a VAR review. That decision gave Brentford renewed hope of a famous result and De Gea denied Eriksen’s stinging 30-yard free-kick in the second half, then stopped Toney with his feet. But it was not all one-way traffic and Raya tipped a Dalot effort onto the woodwork after a one-two with Ronaldo, who had strayed offside in the build-up. Fernandes fizzed across the face of goal having been found by Matic before United created breathing space in the 61st minute. Ronaldo was bundled over in the box by Henry and the veteran sent Raya the wrong way in front of an elated Stretford End. There were standing ovations for Matic and Mata as they were substituted in the final home match before their contracts expire, with the latter able to celebrate a third goal before being replaced. Pontus Jansson nearly turned a Ronaldo cross into his own goal but it went behind for a corner, which Telles swung over for Varane to hook in via a deflection. The planned walk out 17 minutes from time saw some exit but not the masses some expected as flares filled the air and chants increased in volume. Substitute Edinson Cavani looked desperate to score on what is surely his last Old Trafford appearance, but the closing stages petered out and Brentford failed to score a consolation.

It’s a back three for the worst XI according to WhoScored ratings… GK: Illan Meslier – 5.40 The Leeds keeper has been the busiest in the Premier League this season and once again he was exposed by his defence against City. Meslier couldn’t do much about any of the four goals he conceded, even if Gary Neville felt he should have done better with Fernandinho’s strike in added time.  CB: Mads Bech Sorensen – 5.62 One of Brentford’s three centre-backs won only one of the four duels he competed and failed to make a tackle while Manchester United used their last home game of the season to finally look vaguely competent.  CB: Luke Ayling – 5.53 The Leeds skipper lost possession 19 times while being dribbled past six times by a Manchester City player. Ayling also came off second best in eight of the 13 duels he engaged in.  CB: Romain Saiss – 5.59 All of Wolves’ three centre-backs rated lower than 6 in the 3-0 defeat to Brighton, with Willy Boly earning 5.72 and Conor Coady given 5.95. But Saiss scored lowest of the lot after giving away a penalty and losing possession 20 times. The Moroccan attempted 10 long passes, finding a team-mate with none of them.  Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving  RWB: Raphinha – 5.81 Stuart Dallas rated lower on 5.79 but the Cookstown Cafu suffered a serious injury in Leeds’ defeat to City and we’re not monsters. So Raphinha gets the nod after dropping back to right wing-back after Dallas was carried off. The Brazilian lost possession 21 times, failing in both of his attempted dribbles, finding a team-mate with only one of six attempted crosses.  LWB: Rico Henry – 5.18 No tackles, clearances, blocks or interceptions from the Brentford wing-back in the defeat at Old Trafford, where he lost a battle of strength with Cristiano Ronaldo before losing the battle of wits by bundling the Portuguese star to the ground in the box.  MF: Christian Norgaard – 5.92 Seven Brentford starters rated less than six at Old Trafford, with only Henry and Sorensen earning a lower score than Norgaard. The midfielder has made more tackles than anyone else in the Premier League this season but the Dane was quiet at Old Trafford, managing only two tackles before being hooked on 70 minutes. His replacement, Mathias Jensen, earned exactly the same score in his 20-minute cameo.  MF: Leander Dendoncker – 5.83 Ruben Neves got the half-time hook, just when Man Utd turned up to watch the Portuguese, but Dendoncker rated lowest of the Wolves midfielders. The Belgian drifted right before the break in a vain attempt to stop Marc Cucuerella and Leandro Trossard.Dendoncker was sloppy in possession and struggled to get close enough to Brighton to break up their play.  AMF: Joe Willock – 5.84 Jurgen Klopp rotated his midfield at Newcastle but still Liverpool were too strong for the Magpies. Willock was especially quiet, managing only 19 touches while losing possession as often as he found a team-mate with a pass (seven times) before he was replaced with a quarter of the game still remaining.  FWD: Raul Jimenez – 5.80 We usually give substitutes a pass, but Jimenez had the entire second half to make an impact and the Mexican struggled as much as Fabio Silva (5.95). Jimenez failed to attempt a shot on Brighton’s goal and lost possession more times (11) than he found a team-mate with a pass (10).  FWD: Rodrigo – 5.92 The Leeds forward ploughed a lone furrow for 83 minutes but failed to trouble the City defence. The one occasion he escaped Pep Guardiola’s back four, when Aymeric Laporte slipped in the opening minutes, Rodrigo got lost on the half-pitch race to Ederson’s goal, took a touch too many and wasted Leeds’ best chance before City turned the screw.

https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-ten-players-down-back-premier-league-sofa-thriving-gomez,Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving,"As the Premier League season enters its final weeks, clubs have started looking deeper into their squads to find a few hidden first-team gems. 10) Juan Mata (Manchester United) The sofa is knackered and living off past glories, while the item dredged from its innards is a little wornand being imminently shifted, but it remains perfectly serviceable and somehow incredibly handsome for an inanimate object. Juan Mata joined the reigning Premier League champions for a club-record fee and will leave them stranded in the Europa League, yet the Spaniard’s reputation has not been even vaguely damaged by eight-and-a-half years wasted at Old Trafford. It seemed to take Manchester United that long and almost as many managers to figure out how best to utilise Mata, who excelled as a No.10 against Brentford on his 15th Premier League start in the last three seasons. Considering those who have been permitted to float around in the sea of mediocrity and been rewarded, his relative lack of recent use has been startling. This renaissance itself is pointless, coming as it does so soon before his departure as a free agent. Yet the contrast between how well Manchester United play with Mata in the side compared to their disjointed performances without a player of his calibre remains telling.  9)Fabian Delph (Everton)The use of players on deals with a looming expiration date can often be polarising. But Everton supporters will likely give no second thought to Fabian Delph’s contract status, provided he continues to help in their quest for survival. The midfielder started three of 19 Premier League matches under Rafael Benitez and none of Duncan Ferguson’s single-game interim reign. Frank Lampard appreciates the “honesty” of a two-time title winner and hoped in April that Delph would be capable of “carrying on with what he did against Manchester United” before necessary discussions over his future were held. The 32-year-old has held up his end of the bargain, replicating those leadership qualities and defensive instincts that thwarted United in a 1-0 win at Goodison Park to secure the same result against Chelsea. Delph also started the 1-1 draw at home to Leicester and will retain that starting place provided his hamstrings hold up.  8)Tim Iroegbunam (Aston Villa)“I thought Tim had some really good moments today. I think you can see the profile, what he is going to become,” said Steven Gerrard, who added after Tim Iroregbunam’s full senior debut against Norwich: “We need him to realise that he is a first-team player. He needs to use his voice more, he needs to keep pushing himself on a daily basis.” There are worse former Premier League midfielders to receive constructive praise from. A cynic might argue thatIroregbunam’s reward for being able to “out-train certain individuals” was timed impeccably for the visit of Norwich, yet the 18-year-old embraced the challenge and further smoothed that pathway Jacob Ramsey first trod. Iroegbunam was upgraded from four Premier League minutes against Brighton in February to a quarter of an hour at Leicester and then a start in the Norwich victory, having been an unused substitute in 14 of the prior 16 fixtures. He failed to make the squad altogether in the other two; that is unlikely to happen again soon.   7)Nathan Collins (Burnley)The alchemy of Sean Dyche might have wavered at Turf Moor but the last season of signings during his reign could have established Burnley’s spine for the next few years. Maxwel Cornet and Wout Weghorst have finally added some new dimensions to the attack, while Aaron Lennon and Wayne Hennessey have been useful enough as elder statesmen. But the purchases of Championship prospects Connor Roberts and Nathan Collins may be the most important of all; both were eased into the side and neither look likely to relinquish their places. Collins has been a particularly influential arrival. Burnley have won five and drawn four of the 14 Premier League games he has started; they have won two and drawn nine of the 20 he has not. Dyche never gave the centre-half more than three consecutive starts but Collins has not missed a single minute of Mike Jackson and company’s caretaker reign. The 21-year-old’s impact has even allowed Ben Mee to step comfortably into that role and the forthcoming exit of James Tarkowski need no longer be of great concern. The reimagining of Burnley’s defence has already started.  6)Oleksandr Zinchenko (Manchester City)The third signing of Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City tenure still has his uses to the Spaniard almost six years later. His first, Ilkay Gundogan, has become a midfield lynchpin at the Etihad, while Nolito was the opening transfer misfire of this monumental reign. Oleksandr Zinchenko’s first-team relevance has never been particularly settled – the most appearances the Ukrainian has ever made in a single Premier League season is 20 – but he can still be relied upon when needed. That has been a little less often this season. Fifteen starts in all competitions represents a low return for Zinchenko, whose Manchester City minutes for the campaign rank in between those of the similarly peripheral Nathan Ake and the fading Fernandinho. The only teams to beat Guardiola’s side when Zinchenko has started are West Ham, Leipzig and Liverpool, stretched across three different competitions. As the season reaches suffocatingly pressurised levels at the top, the 25-year-old can still slot in at a moment’s notice with no discernible detriment in quality.  5) Joe Gomez (Liverpool)The full circle that has been Joe Gomez under Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool is close to completion. Injuries scuppered the defender’s development initially and are the primary reason for his current role as dual back-up. When the German first brought Gomez, it was as a right-back in 2017/18, designed to eventually share the right-back position with Trent Alexander-Arnold by the end of the season. His current status seems to be generally restricted to filling in when the Liverpool academy product needs a rest. Perhaps next he will rekindle the fruitful centre-back partnership with Virgil van Dijk upon which the Reds won the Premier League title. The list of clubs Gomez has started against is revealing: Milan, Benfica, Watford, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest, Preston, Leicester and Norwich three times. It reflects his bit-part function in this winning machine. But Klopp has challenged his squad players to be “ready for the moment when the situation changes” and throughout his regular appraisals of those on the fringes, Gomez is almost always the first to be mentioned. The 24-year-old would start in most other Premier League defences; serving consistent time on the Anfield sidelines will not be a permanent arrangement either way. 4)Mads Bech Sorensen (Brentford)Sixteen Brentford players have featured more often than Mads Bech Sorensen so far this season, but the Danish centre-half might slowly be rising to prominence. Before Boxing Day his campaign was limited to 19 minutes of the opening win against Arsenal. He then started three straight games until January 2, was benched for a couple more matches and returned to face Manchester United as February approached. Ten consecutive fixtures either on the bench or out of the squad altogether followed, before Ethan Pinnock’s injury at Watford opened a first-team door that had been irregularly blowing barely ajar for months. Sorensen finished that Vicarage Road victory, retained his place in the goalless draw against Tottenham and was arguably the best Brentford defender on show at Manchester United, even if that bar remains low in a 3-0 defeat. He,Saman Ghoddos andMads Roerslev have been critical utility players who might have earned Thomas Frank’s trust during their respective stop-start campaigns.  3)Nathaniel Clyne (Crystal Palace)It has been a curious few years for Nathaniel Clyne. Brendan Rodgers signed one of the Premier League’s most dependable right-backs for Liverpool in 2015, and while Klopp might have been plotting an internal upgrade at some point, it was injury that eventually took him out of the side. A back problem suffered in summer 2017 effectively ended Clyne’s time as a regular starter; another pre-season injury, this time to his cruciate knee ligament in July 2019, signalled his quiet farewell the following year. The 31-year-old had left Crystal Palace for Southampton in 2012 but came back as a free agent and trialist by October 2020, training with his former club to regain fitness and soon a 12-month contract that was renewed last August. Clyne has had to accept a subsidiary role under both Roy Hodgson and Patrick Vieira; he didn’t feature in the Premier League from February to December 2021. But an injury to Joel Ward presented an opening that has reinvigorated the erstwhile England international’s career. Clyne’s current run of 10 consecutive Premier League starts is his longest in five years and an enduring testament to his fortitude. Even if Palace intend on sourcing an improvement at right-back in the transfer market, they could do worse than renew Clyne’s terms as a trustworthy reserve. Nathaniel Clyne appreciation tweet The guy doesn’t stop trying, goes about his business quietly, and has been absolutely solid for us Proper palace ❤️💙 pic.twitter.com/rOfwPYvqRH — Benj (@Beniesta_) April 30, 2022   2)Moises Caicedo (Brighton)Graham Potter perhaps understood the unique pressure of having to live up to such a daunting Barclays surname. Felipe Caicedo struck terror into the heart of Premier League defences for two years at Manchester City and surnamesake Moises would have to carry that burden for the rest of his career. Brighton signed the midfielder for £4.5m in February 2021, sat him on the bench as an unused substitute in five Premier League and FA Cup games, nodded astutely as his Ecuador side reached the Copa America quarter-finals, then sent him on loan to Beerschot in Belgium for some season-long fine-tuning. Except Caicedo would return to the coast sooner than planned. An injury to Enock Mwepu and the loss of Yves Bissouma to Africa Cup of Nations duty led to a midfield shortage at Brighton, the solution to which was a January recall for Caicedo. The Seagulls battled through that period regardless and only for the trip to Arsenal did the 20-year-old finally get his long-awaited debut. Brighton’s seven-game winless run was curtailed at the Emirates as Caicedo shone, assisting one goal and displaying the sort of quality Potter has found impossible to resist since. The midfielder has started each of the subsequent four matches as the next stage of Brighton’s transformation comes into full view.  1) Mo Elneny (Arsenal)“Maybe there wasn’t a lot of competition because we were the only club interested in signing him. Not too many people spoke about him and he was basically not much on the radar,” said Arsene Wenger, really milking the excitement of the Arsenal fanbasein January 2016. Plenty of teams have pursued the Egyptian since, from Leicester to Galatasaray and, most recently, Newcastle. A productive year was spent at Besiktas, yet the Turkish giants thought better of exercising their buy option. And so Elneny returned in summer 2020, farmed out under Unai Emery and inherited by Mikel Arteta. The Spaniard has consummate faith in Elneny to deliver when called upon. He started the Community Shield final win over Liverpool almost two years ago, as well as wins at Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge. Heading into this season it was believed that the midfielder would finally leave, yet even when Arteta culled the squad with ruthless abandon, he knew Elneny would be needed at some point. The Egyptian’s only Premier League starts this campaign have come against Manchester United (twice), Chelsea and West Ham and no player has been more crucial to their turnaround over the past fortnight. Elneny’s contract is scheduled to expire this summer but, by his own admission: “If Arsenal say ‘we want you’ I don’t think about leaving. It’s my family for six years. I love this club.'” Arteta will reciprocate that fondness; he could not find a better or more committed and reliable squad option if he tried.  ",positive,manchester united,7
https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-manchester-united-woodward-murtough-judge,"Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots?","Manchester United are switching their senior management about, but will United supporters get the transfer guru that they’ve craved for years? Manchester United reach the end of the 2021/22 season in a state of flux. They’ve played 22 games in all competitions since the start of this calendar year and they’ve won just eight of them, with only three of those wins having come in the last two months. At the start of the year, the club had three easily identifiable aims for the second half of this season: the FA Cup, the Champions League and qualifying for next year’s Champions League. But four months into the new year, and regardless of a stroll-a-thon win against a Brentford side that didn’t seem to want to push them too hard, any optimistic predictions for the end of this season now lie in tatters. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong United were eliminated by Middlesbrough in the FA Cup and Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, while their involvement in the race for fourth place in the Premier League may still be mathematically possible in theory but would depend on such an improbable sequence of results that it’s fair to completely disregard their chances as anything other than fanciful. The potential for a break in the clouds hovering over Old Trafford comes in the form of new manager Erik Ten Hag, who will take control of the team this summer, but the carousel of accusation has long left behind the notion that the fortunes of a football club in the modern era can be changed for the better by the appointment of one person. The problems at Manchester United run deeper than just the manager, and it was never very likely that the appointment of a new one would cure what ails the club. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wasn’t the only member of the Manchester United management team to leave their position last year. Ed Woodward had to (eventually) fall on his sword over his involvement in the European Super League fiasco, though he didn’t leave his position until the start of February, and now Matt Judge, who’d previously been described as Woodward’s ‘right hand’, has resigned from his position as Manchester United’s director of football negotiations. This follows the decision of the club to appoint Richard Arnold as the new chief executive in January and then John Murtough as director of football in February. Judge, who is currently working out his notice period with the club, will not be missed by the club’s supporters. As the man responsible for negotiating transfers and contracts for Manchester United, Judge became one of the most influential people working behind the scenes at Old Trafford, but after what has come to be considered transfer failure after transfer failure, United fans seem pretty much agreed that just about anybody would be better. Woodward and Judge were, after all, the pair who came up with the wheeze of extending player contracts as a way of maintaining asset value on business spreadsheets, which many believe has been a key reason behind the United squad becoming so unbalanced, while reaffirming to critics the fundamental differences between running Manchester United for the benefit of the stock market over just getting on with being, well, a football club.  It has been suggested that the reason for Judge’s departure at this time is related to Murtough being promoted over his head and cutting off his direct contact with Arnold, though it should be added that most of this does at least seem to be passing fairly amicably, which in itself might be considered somewhat surprising when we recall the extent of the factionalisation of the United dressing room and the steady torrent of leaks that has been flowing from behind those doors over the course of this season. United supporters certainly seem to know who they want to replace him; Paul Mitchell has been earning admiring glances for years. After moving from Southampton to Spurs with Mauricio Pochettino in 2014, he left White Hart Lane two years later to work first with RB Leipzig and then with Monaco as a sporting director in a position that he has held since 2020; Newcastle were said to be considering his services at the end of last year before settling on Dan Ashworth instead, a decision which isn’t exactly going as Newcastle might have hoped. Mitchell is understood to have a close relationship with Ralf Rangnick from his time in Leipzig. He was constantly linked with a move to Old Trafford when the club didn’t even have a sporting director, and now that Murtough is in that position – with Darren Fletcher as technical director – the fans are clamouring for him to be offered Judge’s old position. After all, Judge isn’t the only person from this side of the club to have left his position in the last few months; chief scout Jim Lawlor and head of global scouting Marcel Bout have also departed. But this might not be straightforward. The Mirror has reported that, ‘The Englishman [Mitchell] has been tempted to stay by the offer of a sizeable budget to spend at Monaco in the upcoming window’, based on reporting in Foot Mercato, which claims that Chelsea are also interested in his services. There is also little to suggest that Mitchell is unhappy in Monaco, while others might argue that, although his record with Spurs – where he was behind the decisions to take Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Toby Alderweireld to the club – was excellent, his record at Monaco has not quite left him above criticism. And as ever with Manchester United, all of this raises as many questions as it answers. If Murtough and Fletcher are now running the club’s recruitment, where would Mitchell fit into the equation? If Darren Fletcher is a ‘technical director’, then what is he doing in the dugout on a Saturday afternoon? What exactly is his role? Because even his own attempts to clarify it haven’t exactly sounded convincing. But those questions will keep coming. How do Manchester United plan to attract the elite-level players to which they believe themselves to be entitled if they can’t offer Champions League football? Where does Ralf Rangnick fit into all of this, especially considering that he will now be mixing his consultancy duties with being the head coach of the Austrian national team? Can any new structure or head coach change the culture of leaking to the press which has been relentless this season from a hopelessly factionalised dressing room? And ultimately, will Joel Glazer still be having the final say on all of these changes? Time is of the essence.It’s not that long until the end of the season and the reopening of the transfer window, and few would argue that Manchester United’s squad doesn’t need major work. Somewhere in this thicket of names there may be a combination that works, but while the departure of Matt Judge was necessary (if anything, it’s surprising that he stayed beyond the departure of Woodward), it doesn’t add much to the club ahead of what is likely to be an extremely busy summer. For many Manchester United supporters, the likely truth remains that the club cannot be truly reformed until the Glazer family have left. But with that looking no more likely now than at any other time over the last 17 years, supporters are left hoping against logic that this time the leopards running their clubs might finally change their spots. The post-Ferguson transition is now completing its ninth year without the club’s fortunes having substantially changed, and promises that this time things will definitely be different should probably be taken with a pinch of salt.

https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-career-mino-raiola-demonstrated-absurdities-modern-football,The successful career of Mino Raiola demonstrates the absurdities of modern football,"Raiola was loved by his clients and made himself a lot of money, but the influence of agents in remains at best mixed for the game. In the end, he died as he lived: bullish to his final breath and shrouded in controversy. At a human level, the death of Mino Raiola at the age of 54 is obviously a tragedy, and a sobering reflection upon how fragile life can be. And that shouldn’t be forgotten as we pause to reflect upon his life. But he was also one of the most divisive figures in one of the most divisive part of football’s universe, and that cannot be ignored either. Even his actual passing had an air of hyperreality. His death was first reported in the Italian press early on Thursday morning, only to be contradicted by a tweet from Raiola’s official account which read: ‘Current health status for the ones wondering: pissed off second time in four months they kill me. Seem also able to resuscitate.’ Later the same day, Jose Fortes Rodriguez, a close colleague, told reporters that “he’s in a bad position, but he hasn’t died”. But on Saturday afternoon, his death was confirmed; this time the confirmation came from his official Twitter account and there have been no subsequent contradictions. Raiola inspired polarised opinions and this is hardly surprising. In one respect, he fitted a stereotype: overweight, usually wearing shades and jogging bottoms, seldom (if ever) seen in a suit, and more often than not with a mobile phone pressed to the side of his face. And he was famously abrasive, with a tendency to berate anybody who got in the way of him negotiating the best deal possible for his clients or those who criticised him. He certainly seemed plenty aware of this perception. When he decided to purchase a property in Miami, he spent €9m on the former home of Al Capone. But he also polarised opinion because he was amongst the most successful agents, at least in terms of making himself a lot of money. It’s always been the case that the transfer of an elite-level player can change the course of a club’s history, and the growing influence of agents as power-brokers within the game has had a strange effect on others. Raiola found his name being sung by fans of clubs desperate to sign his clients, but has also found himself being criticised live on television in post-match discussions. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, one of the players with whom he was most closely associated and a player with a similarly abrasive way of dealing with the outside world, was a close personal friend. Those who criticise agents as ‘leeches taking money out of the game’ (or variants thereupon) are almost missing the point; in this day and age, agents are very much part of the game and its inner workings. Consider, for example, the influence of Jorge Mendes at Wolverhampton Wanderers, with the club having won promotion to the Premier League and established themselves in the top half of the Premier League, with European football under their belt. We might not like the fact that agents hold this much influence, but it doesn’t make it any less true. But the career arc of Paul Pogba does ask questions of whether the influence of the agent is always beneficial to the player concerned. Pogba won four Serie A titles in a row by the time he was 23 with Juventus, but his £89m sale to Manchester United in 2016 has seen his career stall (at least at club level), and it remains likely that he will be leaving Old Trafford at the end of this season with just a Europa League and a Carabao Cup medal to show for the six prime years of his career, although who might now be representing him now is unknown. But the facts are stark. Manchester United didn’t get anything like what they were expecting from him and the player doesn’t seem to have had an especially happy time there, but Raiola was reported to have earned himself €27m from the deal.  Right to the very end, Raiola was understood to be working feverishly to complete the transfer of Erling Haaland to Manchester City, but his death comes with this contract not having been completed and there were even reports that Manchester City had visited him in hospital to get it over the line. What happens to that deal now – or to any of his clients – is a question for another day, but with the end of the season and the opening of another transfer window on the horizon, that other day will have to come sooner rather than later. There is a case for saying that agents are good for football. Players need representation when contracts are being signed, and few would question that they would be highly vulnerable to exploitation if that representation didn’t exist. And there’s a case for saying that redistributing football’s vast wealth to players is better than it staying in the hands of those who run clubs, even if the distribution of those wages isn’t particularly even. And even criticism of the Paul Pogba career arc should be tempered by the fact that Pogba never asked Raiola to stop representing him. If the player thinks the agent is doing a good job, that’s all that matters, right? Well… not quite. What the life and death of Mino Raiola exposes is the absurdity of modern football, a world in which an agent will have their name sung from the rafters if he brings a client to your club but is a game-sucking leech if he doesn’t; a world in which transfers are often treated as more important than matches, in which being abrasive and obnoxious is perfectly okay, so long as that person is throwing shade upon someone else that you disagree with; a world in which grotesque inequalities and the commoditisation of people – including children – are simply accepted as if there’s nothing that can be done about them, and in which millions of not-very-wealthy people pay substantial money in season ticket money and pay-TV subscriptions, only for a fair proportion of it to end up with already very wealthy people who often seem to love football while holding it in contempt. There’s every possibility that, wherever he is right now, Mino Raiola is having a good old laugh to himself over the absurdity of it all – including the reporting of both of his deaths – and he’d be absolutely right.

https://www.football365.com/news/man-utd-midfield-targets-rice-gravenberch-tchouameni-haidara-phillips,Man Utd’s five midfield targets: the cases for and against,"Manchester United’s priority for the summer transfer window is said to be a central midfielder. But which one? Here are some of the arguments for and against five of the most often linked targets… Declan Rice For The England international has proved himself to be just the man United need to anchor their midfield. Rice initially carved out a reputation as a screener and this season has shown his credentials as a box-to-boxer. Rice has made more interceptions than anyone in the top flight and only Brentford’s Christian Norgaard has made more combined tackles and interceptions than the 23-year-old’s total of 147. There seems very little risk with Rice. United know exactly what they would be getting and that certainty usually comes at a premium. About that… Against United will have to break their transfer record and almost certainly the Premier League’s for most expensive signing if they want to get Rice out of West Ham. The player would almost certainly like to take the next step (assuming it’s not a lateral move between West Ham and United come the end of the season) and the Irons, under no pressure to offload with Rice under contract until 2025, could sell a huge deal to their fanbase. But that would require United to cough up in excess of £100million. Would they do that, especially if they aren’t in the Champions League next season? United might find themselves shopping with a tighter budget.   Kalvin Phillips For If United can’t get Rice, perhaps they might opt for his mate in England’s midfield. Phillips’ quality has been emphasised by how badly he’s been missed by Leeds during his recent injury-enforced absence. He’s not the only player Marcelo Bielsa and Jesse Marsch have been without, but Phillips seems like the biggest miss, especially given the way opponents have played through the Leeds midfield when he’s not manning the engine room. Even if Leeds appear to be on a firmer footing in the Premier League after two dramatic wins last week, the Whites’ finances could make them susceptible to offers on Phillips. Reports suggest he could go for £60million, which may be around half the price of Rice. Against A few clubs are said to be keen on Phillips, with Liverpool, Man City, Newcastle and Aston Villa all credited with an interest. Indeed, Villa are reported to be leading the race. If Phillips is ushered towards the door by Leeds while his hometown club seeks a windfall, then the 26-year-old will have to consider very carefully his next move if he wants to protect a legacy he’s cultivated at Elland Road as one of their own. Crossing the Pennines would tarnish that. Alan Smith made that move when Leeds were on the bones of their arse and they still haven’t really forgiven him in West Yorkshire. Indeed, it was reported last year that Phillips has already decided not to risk it. So United might be wise not to chase a lost cause. Of all those reportedly interested in Phillips this summer, I am told West Ham and Aston Villa are the only clubs to make enquiries so far. WHUFC remain interested following their January offers and AVFC CEO Purslow is a longtime admirer of Kalvin. As of now, no contact from MUFC — Jonathan Shrager (@JonathanShrager) March 22, 2022   Ryan Gravenberch For Gravenberch remains a teenager but has already amassed almost 100 appearances for Ajax and 10 caps for Holland. By the end of the season, he will have played almost four full senior campaigns before his 20th birthday. According to his former youth coach with the Amsterdam club, the deep-lying midfielder is “a better version of Paul Pogba” with the physique of Frank Rijkaard. Gravenberch’s career so far has been spent under the wing of Erik ten Hag. If United opt to name the Ajax coach as their new manager, then there would be sense in having him bring a player he knows better than anyone else can claim to. He would be half the price of Phillips and around a quarter of the cost Rice might be, which is important now. Against United’s last move for an Ajax midfielder was hardly a roaring success. Perhaps that is why Gravenberch is said to be lukewarm about the prospect of moving to Old Trafford, especially with Bayern Munich keen. Apparently, Gravenberch would prefer to hear first what the Bavarians have to say and the story goes that personal terms have already been agreed. All Bayern must do is find common ground with Ajax over a fee and their opening offer of £21million wasn’t too far from achieving its purpose. United may well be wasting their time putting Gravenberch at the top of their list of targets if he really is edging closer to Bayern. Where would you rather go right now?  Amadou Haidara For Ralf Rangnick certainly thought United would suit Haidara since he recommended that the club move on the Mali international in January. They decided not to because, well, United. The interim manager knows Haidara well from his time at RB Leipzig. It was Rangnick who took him to Germany from Salzburg and Haidara established himself as an important player for Julian Nagelsmann, Marsch and now Domenico Tedesco. Haidara can screen but Rangnick wanted him because of his ability to press further up the pitch. We assume United’s new coach will want to play a similar style to that which Rangnick has struggled to implement with the current squad and Haidara would certainly improve those prospects. In contrast to Gravenberch and Phillips, the prospect of playing for United arouses Haidara. “My dream club is Manchester United,” he said in 2019. Though plenty has happened since which may have prompted a rethink. Against Rangnick’s opinion presumably hasn’t been founded on Haidara’s stats. In the Bundesliga alone: 109 players have attempted more tackles; 195 have a higher tackle success rate than Haidara’s 22.6 per cent; 113 players have applied more pressures; and 27 have a higher pressure success rate. For comparison, Scott McTominay’s tackle success percentage is 49.2 per cent and Fred’s is 25.4 per cent, which is the worst in the United squad, but still better than Haidara’s.  Aurelien Tchouameni For United are just one of the clubs interested in Tchouameni. Apparently, so too are Chelsea, City and Liverpool. Plus other big hitters on the continent. But the 22-year-old reportedly has the Premier League in mind for when he leaves Monaco. Tchouameni was Ligue 1’s best young player last season and already has seven France caps to his name. So impressive has he been while standing in for N’Golo Kante, Pogba said: “We wish him to play a lot more games and that I am always by his side.” There is almost no chance of the pair teaming up at Old Trafford, butTchouameni could pick up a lot quicker the instructions of a new manager than Pogba and his team-mates have shown they are able or willing to over the years. “In his position, you need to be disciplined and organise others around you,” said then-Monaco coach Niko Kovac. “He is always trying to learn and understand. He absorbs all the information we give to him.” Tchouameni wouldn’t break the bank for United, with a reported asking price of £42million within the Red Devils’ budget this summer, even if they are tightening their belts. Against Technically and tactically, there is no reason United shouldn’t go forTchouameni this summer. He’s within budget, young but gathering experience quick and only getting better. But, of course, United are not the only club keen on the 22-year-old. Given how United hate losing face, will they really be prepared to go up against the likes of City and Liverpool when their rivals can offer Champions League football when they most likely cannot? That’s not to say they shouldn’t move decisively overTchouameni – just don’t expect them to.  ",positive,manchester united,2
https://www.football365.com/news/tuchel-tells-chelsea-beat-man-utd-e80m-ligue-1-star,Tuchel tells Chelsea to beat Man Utd to €80m star ‘at all costs’,"Thomas Tuchel has urged Chelsea to beat Manchester United to the signing ofAurelien Tchouameni ‘at all costs’. Tchouameni has emerged as one of the finest young talents in European football in the last year, starring for Monaco and the France international team. READ MORE: 2020 vision: Every PL club’s best signing of the decade so far Paul Pogba played alongsideTchouameni in France’s 2-1 win over Spain in the Nations League final in October, and hailed his “extraordinary” talent. Pogba said:“Very, very good. He’s not a boy, he’s a man. “It’s a pleasure to play next to him. He brings a lot of energy. A lot of energy, extraordinary technical and physical quality. “We wish him to play a lot more games and that I am always by his side.” Despite Chelsea’s strength in the two holding midfield roles, they have struggled with absnences in those positions this season, and with N’Golo Kante and Jorginho both now 30 years old, Tuchel wants fresh blood in the middle of the park. Conor Gallagher is expected to return from his loan at Crystal Palace to stake a claim for a place in the Chelsea team next season, but his form hasn’t lessened their interest in Tchouameni. The 21-year-old – valued by Monaco at €80million – is also on United’s radar, with some reports suggesting the Red Devils are leading the race. But Marca (via football.london) claim Tuchel has singled outTchouameni as his number one target and he’s told Chelsea to land him ‘at all costs’ this summer. In an interview with L’Equipe, Tchouameni has previously discussed his future, insisting that he does not let it distract him from his work with Monaco. “I remember I was in Paris, after the Nations League. I woke up and my phone had blown up,” he said. “My father called me, we talked about everything and he told me that I was on the front page of Marca. I went on Twitter and saw for myself. “I told him it was cool, but what does it actually matter? It doesn’t. The front page of Marca will not define me or allow me to perform well in matches. It’s not real life, but it is the media world, the football business. They talk about me today but tomorrow, they’ll be talking about another. “In the dressing room, they put the cover up and laughed’ ‘Oh, you’re leaving us already?’ It’s flattering, but I don’t wake up in the morning thinking about it.” ",positive,manchester united,1

Tchouameni is on the wishlists of a number of top European clubs, including Manchester United and Chelsea, but Liverpool have also entered the fray. MAILBOX: If Mo Salah was white he would get twice as many fouls. And other opinions… The 22-year-old midfielder has been a stalwart for Monaco since his £16m move from Bordeaux in the summer of 2020. The Times claim ‘the clever recruitment of the likes of Luis Díaz, Diogo Jota and Ibrahima Konaté in recent transfer windows has maintained the club’s forward momentum by freshening up the squad and that approach is likely to continue’. The report continues, ‘they like Monaco’s Aurélien Tchouaméni, although they are aware the France international is attracting interest from Real Madrid. Whether they press ahead with interest depends on a number of factors, including price, but it would be a midfielder with a similar profile to the powerful Tchouaméni that they would target should he be out of reach’. It’s also claimed that the club is interested inAberdeen’s 18-year-old right back Calvin Ramsay, who is also wanted by Leeds United, while a deal forFulham’s Fabio Carvalho, 19, has already been lined up. Liverpool’s desire to continue to improve the squad has been boosted by ‘positive noises’ from Jurgen Klopp over signing a new deal at the club. President of Fenway Sports Group (FSG), Mike Gordon, flew to Liverpool on Wednesday for the Reds’ Champions league semi-final clash with Villarreal with his ulterior motive to sit down with Klopp to discuss an extension. With Liverpool still on course to complete an unprecedented quadruple this season, FSG are understandably keen to tie Klopp – whom they have always seen as the perfect manager for the club – down to a new deal. The report claims ‘the strong bond Klopp has forged with Liverpool from an ownership, player and supporter perspective underpins his contentment’. But adds ‘afinal decision from Klopp on his future will also be heavily influenced by whether the assistant managers Pepijn Lijnders and Peter Krawietz are also on board, given the strength of his relationship with them’.

The Frenchman has also been linked with a move to Manchester United. It is said that Monaco’s asking price ‘could go up to £50m’. Following a spell at Bordeaux, Tchouameni made the move to Monaco during the winter transfer window in 2020. Aston Villa and Steven Gerrard are on the wrong trajectory together The 22-year-old has been an ever-present for Monaco over the past two seasons. He has been in fine form as he has played 47 times this term across all competitions. Tchouameni made his senior debut for France last year and he has now been capped eight times. Foot Mercato journalist Santi Aouna has revealed (via Twitter) that Liverpool are targeting Tchouameni. It is said that ‘contacts have been initiated’ between Liverpool and Monaco. In a boost to Liverpool, the player is reportedly ‘interested in the idea’ of playing in the Premier League. Meanwhile, Michael Owen has been taken aback by the recent performances of Divock Origi: “If you are in a rhythm, the easy bit is coming on and making an impact as a sub,” Owen said. “Everyone is tiring and it’s a free punch, that’s the easy bit. “The hard bit is the never playing bit. You get out of rhythm. Your mindset is not playing. “You go to bed on a Friday and you don’t even expect to play. “If you keep doing the right things, keep eating the right food, go to bed at the right time, and training perfectly. And you keep getting disappointed every weekend, then something switches off, at some point. “For him to stay at that level and that sharpness, and every single time he is called upon he comes on and makes a difference is quite staggering. “He doesn’t lose his fitness, his sharpness, he doesn’t lose anything, appetite and his attitude. “If I kept coming on and scoring, and being brushed aside and not starting and not playing, I’d start to get sickened by it. “So fair play to him, [he’s got] a great attitude.” ",positive,manchester united,1

The Ajax boss has reportedly agreed terms in principle with United but is yet to be officially announced as their next permanent manager. Gossip: Manchester United linked with Premier League trio It is thought that confirmation of Ten Hag’s decision to swap the Eredivisie for the Premier League will come after the upcoming Dutch Cup final this weekend, which will see his side face PSV Eindhoven. With the 52-year-old’s arrival looking imminent, a number of stars have been linked with the club as they look to rebuild on what has been another disappointing season. United have made it five consecutive seasons without a trophy after a campaign of turmoil on and off the pitch and could miss out on qualification for the Champions League next season. Arsenal and Spurs are currently ahead of the Red Devils in the race for the top four. Whether the prospect of no Champions League football next season will affect who the club will target this summer, it remains to be seen. However, that wont stop a number of players from around the globe from being linked with a move to Manchester. ESPN are reporting that the latest name to be on the Man Utd shortlist is Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni. The Frenchman, who has already made eight appearances for the senior national side at the age of 22, has been in fine form in Ligue 1 this season. His performances have drawn attention from a number of top sides around Europe, including Liverpool, Chelsea and Juventus. The 22-year-old now appears to be on the shortlist for manager-to-be Ten Hag as he looks to improve what has been a troublesome position for a number of years at Old Trafford. This season Scott McTominay, Fred, Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba have all vied for a starting role in initially Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side and, more recently, under Ralf Rangnick. Tchouameni’s international teammates Pogba is out-of-contract in the summer and doesn’t look likely to agree a new deal whilst Matic, at 33, is hardly a long-term solution. Scotland international McTominay and Brazilian Fred have improved this season but if United are to take the next step and begin challenging for titles again, they will need reinforcements and Monaco’s Tchouameni could be brought in to do just that. It is also worth mentioning that Donny van de Beek, who is currently on loan at Everton, could feature more prominently next season after working under Ten Hag at Ajax.

But which one? Here are some of the arguments for and against five of the most often linked targets… Declan Rice For The England international has proved himself to be just the man United need to anchor their midfield. Rice initially carved out a reputation as a screener and this season has shown his credentials as a box-to-boxer. Rice has made more interceptions than anyone in the top flight and only Brentford’s Christian Norgaard has made more combined tackles and interceptions than the 23-year-old’s total of 147. There seems very little risk with Rice. United know exactly what they would be getting and that certainty usually comes at a premium. About that… Against United will have to break their transfer record and almost certainly the Premier League’s for most expensive signing if they want to get Rice out of West Ham. The player would almost certainly like to take the next step (assuming it’s not a lateral move between West Ham and United come the end of the season) and the Irons, under no pressure to offload with Rice under contract until 2025, could sell a huge deal to their fanbase. But that would require United to cough up in excess of £100million. Would they do that, especially if they aren’t in the Champions League next season? United might find themselves shopping with a tighter budget.   Kalvin Phillips For If United can’t get Rice, perhaps they might opt for his mate in England’s midfield. Phillips’ quality has been emphasised by how badly he’s been missed by Leeds during his recent injury-enforced absence. He’s not the only player Marcelo Bielsa and Jesse Marsch have been without, but Phillips seems like the biggest miss, especially given the way opponents have played through the Leeds midfield when he’s not manning the engine room. Even if Leeds appear to be on a firmer footing in the Premier League after two dramatic wins last week, the Whites’ finances could make them susceptible to offers on Phillips. Reports suggest he could go for £60million, which may be around half the price of Rice. Against A few clubs are said to be keen on Phillips, with Liverpool, Man City, Newcastle and Aston Villa all credited with an interest. Indeed, Villa are reported to be leading the race. If Phillips is ushered towards the door by Leeds while his hometown club seeks a windfall, then the 26-year-old will have to consider very carefully his next move if he wants to protect a legacy he’s cultivated at Elland Road as one of their own. Crossing the Pennines would tarnish that. Alan Smith made that move when Leeds were on the bones of their arse and they still haven’t really forgiven him in West Yorkshire. Indeed, it was reported last year that Phillips has already decided not to risk it. So United might be wise not to chase a lost cause. Of all those reportedly interested in Phillips this summer, I am told West Ham and Aston Villa are the only clubs to make enquiries so far. WHUFC remain interested following their January offers and AVFC CEO Purslow is a longtime admirer of Kalvin. As of now, no contact from MUFC — Jonathan Shrager (@JonathanShrager) March 22, 2022   Ryan Gravenberch For Gravenberch remains a teenager but has already amassed almost 100 appearances for Ajax and 10 caps for Holland. By the end of the season, he will have played almost four full senior campaigns before his 20th birthday. According to his former youth coach with the Amsterdam club, the deep-lying midfielder is “a better version of Paul Pogba” with the physique of Frank Rijkaard. Gravenberch’s career so far has been spent under the wing of Erik ten Hag. If United opt to name the Ajax coach as their new manager, then there would be sense in having him bring a player he knows better than anyone else can claim to. He would be half the price of Phillips and around a quarter of the cost Rice might be, which is important now. Against United’s last move for an Ajax midfielder was hardly a roaring success. Perhaps that is why Gravenberch is said to be lukewarm about the prospect of moving to Old Trafford, especially with Bayern Munich keen. Apparently, Gravenberch would prefer to hear first what the Bavarians have to say and the story goes that personal terms have already been agreed. All Bayern must do is find common ground with Ajax over a fee and their opening offer of £21million wasn’t too far from achieving its purpose. United may well be wasting their time putting Gravenberch at the top of their list of targets if he really is edging closer to Bayern. Where would you rather go right now?  Amadou Haidara For Ralf Rangnick certainly thought United would suit Haidara since he recommended that the club move on the Mali international in January. They decided not to because, well, United. The interim manager knows Haidara well from his time at RB Leipzig. It was Rangnick who took him to Germany from Salzburg and Haidara established himself as an important player for Julian Nagelsmann, Marsch and now Domenico Tedesco. Haidara can screen but Rangnick wanted him because of his ability to press further up the pitch. We assume United’s new coach will want to play a similar style to that which Rangnick has struggled to implement with the current squad and Haidara would certainly improve those prospects. In contrast to Gravenberch and Phillips, the prospect of playing for United arouses Haidara. “My dream club is Manchester United,” he said in 2019. Though plenty has happened since which may have prompted a rethink. Against Rangnick’s opinion presumably hasn’t been founded on Haidara’s stats. In the Bundesliga alone: 109 players have attempted more tackles; 195 have a higher tackle success rate than Haidara’s 22.6 per cent; 113 players have applied more pressures; and 27 have a higher pressure success rate. For comparison, Scott McTominay’s tackle success percentage is 49.2 per cent and Fred’s is 25.4 per cent, which is the worst in the United squad, but still better than Haidara’s.  Aurelien Tchouameni For United are just one of the clubs interested in Tchouameni. Apparently, so too are Chelsea, City and Liverpool. Plus other big hitters on the continent. But the 22-year-old reportedly has the Premier League in mind for when he leaves Monaco. Tchouameni was Ligue 1’s best young player last season and already has seven France caps to his name. So impressive has he been while standing in for N’Golo Kante, Pogba said: “We wish him to play a lot more games and that I am always by his side.” There is almost no chance of the pair teaming up at Old Trafford, butTchouameni could pick up a lot quicker the instructions of a new manager than Pogba and his team-mates have shown they are able or willing to over the years. “In his position, you need to be disciplined and organise others around you,” said then-Monaco coach Niko Kovac. “He is always trying to learn and understand. He absorbs all the information we give to him.” Tchouameni wouldn’t break the bank for United, with a reported asking price of £42million within the Red Devils’ budget this summer, even if they are tightening their belts. Against Technically and tactically, there is no reason United shouldn’t go forTchouameni this summer. He’s within budget, young but gathering experience quick and only getting better. But, of course, United are not the only club keen on the 22-year-old. Given how United hate losing face, will they really be prepared to go up against the likes of City and Liverpool when their rivals can offer Champions League football when they most likely cannot? That’s not to say they shouldn’t move decisively overTchouameni – just don’t expect them to.  ",positive,manchester united,2

Tchouameni was named Ligue 1’s Young Player of the Year last season after a breakout campaign which saw him start all but two of Monaco’s league games. The 22-year-old’s accomplished displays as a deep-lying midfielder caught the eye of clubs such as Chelsea, Man Utd and Real Madrid, all of whom retained their interest going into the January transfer window. The financial insanity must stop; football needs recalibration A report last month insisted that Liverpoolare now ‘more interested’ in Tchouameni than AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessieas they look to boost their engine room in the summer transfer window. Over the weekend it was claimed thatLiverpool and Man United ‘have asked’ about the France international’s availability and Tchouameni ‘would not see the option [of a Premier League move] badly’. And now Spanish publication Marca (via Sport Witness) reckon that Liverpool are now ‘placed in the lead’ for Tchouameni along with rivals Manchester United and Manchester City. Meanwhile, Liverpool beat Nottingham Forest 1-0 on Sunday as they moved into the semi-finals of the FA Cup with Jurgen Klopp’s men excelling in all competitions. Diogo Jota’s 78th-minute goal secured a first win at Nottingham Forest’s City ground in 13 visits – succeeding where Arsenal and Leicester had failed this season – to book a Wembley date with Manchester City on April 16. Getting past Forest, in the first meeting between the two clubs in 23 years, proved difficult enough. Had Philip Zinckernagel not missed a one-on-one with goalkeeper Alisson Becker a couple of minutes before Jota struck the outcome could have been different. “It was the game we expected, especially if you don’t use your chances,” Klopp said. “We could have played better, but we should have scored in the first half. If we scored earlier it would be a completely different game. “All respect to Steve (Cooper) and Nottingham Forest, a top, top performance, really professional, really well organised. ““It was a brilliant atmosphere.

He has been the subject of a number of ‘juicy offers’ already with the 22-year-old ‘aiming for the Premier League’. Meanwhile, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp knows Andy Robertson is “desperate to deliver” as the left-back was landed with even greater responsibility in the wake of Trent Alexander-Arnold’s absence. With the Reds’ marauding right-back, who has provided two goals and a career-best 16 assists this season, sidelined for a number of weeks with a hamstring injury, the emphasis will switch heavily to the Scotland captain on the opposite flank. While he has not been as prolific as his counterpart he was man of the match in Wednesday’s defeat of Arsenal, setting up the important second goal for Roberto Firmino. “It is the full package of Robbo, not only as a player but a person as well. He wants desperately to deliver and work for the team,” said Klopp on Friday. “Even though he and Trent set up a lot of goals, there is still space for improvement in the decisive moments. “The goal (at Arsenal) was one of our favourite goals for a long time; first we win the ball back and second Robbo is waiting with his cross until he saw Bobby is now ready for it. “It was an incredible pass in the end and Bobby had to do a lot to get it past (Aaron) Ramsdale. “Yes played a really good game.

The former Republic of Ireland international played 480 times for the Red Devils over 13 seasons, winning seven Premier League titles, four FA Cups and a Champions League. He played alongside a number of amazing players during his time at Old Trafford and Sky Sports asked him to pick hisgreatest Man Utd XI of the Premier League era on their Monday Night Football show. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? Keane decided on a team of Peter Schmeichel; Gary Neville, Gary Pallister, Jaap Stam, Denis Irwin; David Beckham, Paul Ince, Bryan Robson, Ryan Giggs; Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo. And the Man Utd legend explained his decision to make Schmeichel the goalkeeper despite him not being “as good as everyone thought”. “I don’t like upsetting my team-mates,” Keane said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football. “I had to leave out some brilliant players, brilliant characters, but obviously I’ve done it. Edwin [Van der Sar] was nearly a sparring partner. “Goalkeepers get too much praise when they make a save. I had to go with Peter because he was very, very good – not as good as everyone thought, but very good. “And obviously, I have good memories with him. He was a good character in the dressing room – me and Peter certainly weren’t the best of mates, absolutely far from it, but the most important thing I had for Peter – and all of my team-mates – was huge respect. “He produced big moments and helped us get over the line in big matches, that’s the bottom line. Before you go into any match, you look over your shoulder at who’s in goal and you go, ‘yeah, I’m happy with him – we’ve got a chance.’ Peter would produce and help us get trophies.” Keane selected Stam and Pallister as his two centre-backs but he felt harsh leaving Ferdinand and Steve Bruce out of his XI. The former midfielder added: “Centre-back was probably the hardest one because Rio was excellent, Brucey was a good character. I just couldn’t leave Jaap Stam out. He didn’t play as many games as the other lads but he was big, strong, brave, brilliant at one-on-ones. “The other one was an issue but I’ve gone with Gary Pallister. I’d probably say [it was between Pallister and] Rio. Rio was obviously a good athlete and read the game well but my relationship with Pally was pretty good as well. “Did [Stam] have any real weaknesses? He could head it, he could leap, he could read the game, he was strong, aggressive, a decent lad. I got on really well with him. Unfortunately you try to move on, but Jaap was a brilliant player for Man United.

Bryan was a great player for Man United, full of courage, scored some big goals for the club when Man United weren’t at their best. I had some brilliant days with Butty and Scholesy. “Next to Robbo, I’m going to put Paul Ince. Incey was a very, very good player. Maybe he tarnished his United reputation; he ended up playing at Liverpool or wherever. When he was at United, there was all talk of Incey being the governor. “People kind of held that against him but that was just banter, there was no nastiness with that.

https://www.football365.com/news/mediawatch-revealed-truth-ferdinand-quotes-thiago-liverpool?utm_source=Recirculation&utm_medium=WP_Related_Articles_Unit&utm_campaign=Benchmark,Revealed: The shocking truth behind those Ferdinand quotes about Liverpool midfielder Thiago,"Pep Guardiola’s future is a point of concern after a Champions League thriller, but those Rio Ferdinand quotes on Thiago are the big news. Increasingly stranger things Ian Ladyman of the Daily Mail understandably enjoyed himself at the Etihad but something was eating him up inside: ‘We are four years in to the second decade of Middle East ownership now and watching this incredible game of European football it was hard not to wonder what further fabulous dramas may lie ahead. ‘More particularly, it seemed increasingly strange – as City traded thunderous blows with the best team in Spain – to ponder why Pep Guardiola would even think about leaving when his current contract expires at the end of next season.’ That does seem an ‘increasingly strange’ angle to ‘ponder’ after ‘watching this incredible game of European football’, which is presumably why literally no-one else did. But here we are. Guardiola has a contract that runs until 2023. He has been at Manchester City since 2016. This is already his longest unbroken spell as manager of one club by two years. That tenure, a four-year reign at Barcelona, came to an end because of a self-confessed need to “recharge my batteries”. It is not difficult to figure out why Guardiola might leave when his deal expires. But again, why is this hypothetical scenario that might come to pass in 13 months’ timeeven a subject of discussion after the first leg of an enthralling Champions League semi-final? There is no answer. Only more instances of things seeming strange. ‘This is the City team that Guardiola built and much as they were brilliantly expansive and precocious here, it is one that will only grow better, wiser and more talented from this point. ‘Next season, for example, the Premier League leaders are expected to have the Norwegian forward Erling Haaland in their ranks. ‘So, yes, it seems strange that Guardiola would even think about leaving as he has previously suggested he will.’ It would be strange if Guardiola didn’t think about leaving when his current contract of employment runs out. It would be strange if Guardiola was even looking beyond May, considering this season could yet end with Manchester City winning no trophies or claiming a Premier and Champions League double. It is downright bizarre that this is such a point of focus. ‘For all its quirks, this has the look of the greatest City team Guardiola has assembled in his six years in England. Its rivalry with Liverpool is magnetic. ‘If Guardiola does not continue to work here beyond next season, it’s hard to wonder where he will go. Even harder to work out why.’ It truly is impossible to predict what a man who took a sabbatical after four years of intense and uninterrupted elite coaching could potentially do after seven years of intense and uninterrupted elite coaching. Hopefully by the end of that seventh year, Ladyman has figured out the ‘increasingly strange’ world of football contracts.  Pep talk ‘Pep Guardiola must be furious with narrow Man City win – Real Madrid are comeback kings’ – the Daily Mirror headline to John Cross’ opinion piece. ‘Pep Guardiola’s delight with Manchester City’s swashbuckling win against Real Madrid outweighed any frustration about their inability to put the Champions League semi-final to bed in a jaw-dropping first leg’ – MailOnline.  Spill the Thi The biggest story on Wednesday, of course, is not Manchester City beating Real Madrid 4-3 in a thriller. It’s that Rio Ferdinand has said some words about Thiago Alcantara. ‘Rio Ferdinand claims Thiago Alcantara told him he wanted to sign for Man United before joining Liverpool from Bayern Munich and says his ‘ridiculous’ form shows ‘players need time’… as he tips Jadon Sancho to emulate him,’ is the beefyMailOnline headline. They add with no little specificity that ‘Ferdinand reveals the player told him he was keen on becoming a Red Devil in 2020 when he was linked with a move away from the Bundesliga’. Except Ferdinand revealed no such thing. He was asked about Manchester United’s previous interest in the midfielder, said that he “spoke to him” and Thiago “wanted to come to United”. But this was in 2013. Not 2020, and definitely not ‘before joining Liverpool from Bayern Munich’. Ferdinand has even spoken about this at length before on this very same podcast. Still, if one outlet blinks then others must follow: ‘Rio Ferdinand claims Thiago Alcantara “wanted” to join Man Utd before Liverpool transfer’ – Daily Mirror website. ”I spoke to him’ – Rio Ferdinand makes Thiago transfer claim over Liverpool and Man United’ – Liverpool Echo, who echo the demonstrably erroneous claim that ‘the former England international has claimedThiagotold him he was keen on a move to Old Trafford in 2020’. ‘Rio Ferdinand claims Thiago Alcantara told him he wanted to make Man Utd transfer before moving to rivals Liverpool’ – The Sun website, who even quote Ferdinand as saying “I spoke to him at the time he joined” Liverpool to make it sound more current, when he said no such thing.  But credit where it’s due: Manchester Evening News say ‘Rio Ferdinand makes Thiago admission over Manchester United ‘interest’, yet they clarify that he is talking about a situation many years ago, instead of following everyone else in pretending Thiago rejected Manchester United in favour of Liverpool. Actual fair play.  Saint Etienne “Anfield is hell!” – Villarreal’s Etienne Capoue claims Liverpool have worst stadium’ …to play at as a visiting team, as the Daily Mirror website well knows.  Trophy strife The Liverpool Echo headline: ‘Liverpool trophy priority is clear as one cup stands out in quadruple quest’ The Liverpool Echo sub-headline: ‘All Liverpool fans will want the quadruple from here if possible – but is there one trophy that means more than the others?’ You would hope so, considering Liverpool’s ‘trophy priority is clear as one cup stands out in quadruple quest’. Yet of the two writers tasked with debating the point, Sean Bradbury argues the case for the Premier League and Richard Garnett is in favour of the Champions League.

https://www.football365.com/news/antonio-conte-appointed-tottenham-hotspur-boss-lured-daniel-levy-contagious-enthusiasm,Conte appointed Spurs boss – lured by Levy’s ‘contagious enthusiasm’,"Former Chelsea boss Antonio Conte has been appointed as Tottenham Hotspur’s new manager and he is “extremely happy” to return to management. Spurs have acted quickly to appoint Conte. He replaces Nuno Espirito Santo, who was sacked on Monday. The Italian has penned an 18-month contract. He previously led Chelsea to the Premier League title in 2016/17. Antonio Conte by the numbers: Games, trophies, signings… He had previously been in advanced talks with Spurs in June about becoming Jose Mourinho’s successor, but they broke down after the two parties were at odds over key issues. However, managing director Fabio Paratici is now in position at the Premier League club and has a strong relationship with the 52-year-old, having worked with him at Juventus. And those differences have now been overcome, with chairman Daniel Levy looking to the serial winner to turn Spurs back into a force in English football. “I am extremely happy to return to coaching, and to do so at a Premier League club that has the ambition to be a protagonist again,” Conte told the club website. “Tottenham Hotspur has state-of-the-art facilities and one of the best stadiums in the world. “I can’t wait to start working to convey to the team and the fans the passion, mentality and determination that have always distinguished me, as a player and as a coach. “Last summer our union did not happen because the end of my relationship with Inter was still too recent and emotionally too involved with the end of the season, so I felt that it wasn’t yet the right time to return to coaching. “But the contagious enthusiasm and determination of Daniel Levy in wanting to entrust me with this task had already hit the mark. Now that the opportunity has returned, I have chosen to take it with great conviction.” Nuno was relieved of his duties after Levy and Paratici met on Sunday to discuss his future, with the news delivered early on Monday morning. The Portuguese was a condemned man following Saturday’s 3-0 home loss to Manchester United, when fans chanted ‘You don’t know what you’re doing’ and roundly booed him at full-time. Spurs have lost five of the last seven Premier League games and have gone two hours and 16 minutes without having a shot on goal. Conte inherits a team in ninth position in the table, five points off the top four after 10 games. The Italian, who is expected to be given some funds in January to strengthen the squad, is due to take training on Tuesday and be in charge of Thursday’s Europa Conference League clash with Vitesse Arnhem. He becomes the fourth manager to cross the divide between Stamford Bridge and north London, following Glenn Hoddle, Andre Villas-Boas and Mourinho in managing both clubs. Paratici said: “We are delighted to welcome Antonio to the club. His track record speaks for itself, with vast experience and trophies in both Italy and England. “I know first-hand the qualities Antonio can bring to us, having worked with him at Juventus, and look forward to seeing his work with our talented group of players.” Spurs said an update on Conte’s coaching staff will follow in due course.

But what about from the head? It’s no great surprise that Mauricio Pochettino looks set to lose his job as PSG manager. Having failed to win the Champions League, not even romping home to the Ligue 1 title was ever going to save him. Even so, the speed with which the Parisiens have apparently set about binning him off is a brutal old business. It’s been a strange spell in Paris for Pochettino. It has, predictably, brought the trophies his CV lacked. It has, just as predictably, exposed the disingenuous nature of the previous arguments against his coaching talents because he hadn’t won trophies. Because it was never really about the trophies; it never is. It’s just using whatever stick is available to beat the target of your criticism. Had he won a Carabao or FA Cup with his magnificent Spurs side, the ‘no trophies’ argument would simply have become ‘only a Carabao’. Even winning the 2019 Champions League would simply have been memory-holed and written off as a freak occurrence. If that sounds implausible, just have a look at what Manchester United fans were saying when people started talking up the City-Liverpool rivalry as the Premier League’s greatest. ‘Only one Premier League title’ was the cudgel against Liverpool and Klopp. Anything can be written off if it’s inconvenient. Pochettino has done precisely as well as anyone could have realistically expected at PSG, but inevitably that has seen his stock fall. Anyone could win Ligue 1 with PSG, it’s meaningless, as long as you ignore the fact that Thomas Tuchel could not pull it off last season. And no manager has delivered the Champions League title they crave and it remains doubtful whether any manager can overcome the disadvantage that comes from trying to level up from a weaker domestic league to the teak-tough knockout stages. His reign in Paris has been flawed as it was always likely to be. His next job after Spurs always had to be one of the superclubs, but PSG always seemed the very worst fit despite his links to the club in its former guise as just a football club. Pochettino’s ethos is all about the collective – “you sign a contract to train, not to play” – and that was never a good fit for a club that is a branding and promotional tool first and football team second. The superstars will play, must play, and that’s that. His detractors use his flawed spell in Paris as evidence that there remains something second tier about him, that he isn’t quite up to the biggest jobs. Really all that we know is that he wasn’t right for this specific one of the biggest jobs. The criticism is unsurprising, but what is strange is that there also now seems to be some negative retrospective reappraisal of his time at Spurs, much of it coming from Spurs fans themselves. Nothing that has happened to either Spurs or Pochettino since his departure appears to support this view, but it’s definitely there. And that’s because, inevitably, the news of his imminent Paris exit sparks talk of a Spurs return. The timing is key here, because even a couple of weeks ago it would not have played out quite the same. When the Manchester United job was still available and Antonio Conte’s Spurs appeared to have struck gold by simply scoring four goals every week, the talk would have been more in the direction of United. But Erik Ten Hag is in at Manchester United, and Spurs have gone two moribund games without a shot on target against Brighton and Brentford. Conte is once again making eyes at the exit door and uncertainty has returned. Champions League football has also gone from ‘probable’ to ‘unlikely’. So would and should Spurs consider bringing Poch back? The case from the heart is easily made. There is without doubt unfinished business on both sides here, and Pochettino has made no secret of his desire to return to the club one day. The appeal of just running with the energia universal vibes and bringing him back, re-signing Christian Eriksen and re-swapping Bryan Gil for Erik Lamela should be obvious even to those dreary trophy-counters turned trophy-dismissers. But is there an argument to be made with the head? We’re saying yes. And it’s this. Antonio Conte is a better manager than Mauricio Pochettino, but is he a better Spurs manager at this moment? That’s less clear-cut.  The reports of his interest in the PSG job coming moments after news that Pochettino was likely on his way out are the key. His camp moved to brief against those reports, but the fact is that even if not true they are entirely believable and plausible. He is not a manager for the long haul at even the biggest clubs, and certainly not at Spurs. He has achieved a lot in a short space of time in the “painful rebuild” that was already overdue when Pochettino left Spurs in 2019 and became more and more urgent as Jose Mourinho huffed and sulked around the place for a year and a half. If he were a manager Spurs could realistically keep for five years, then everything Conte has done since November would be fine and dandy. From where he found them they had no business being in Champions League contention this season. If this was stage one of a proper new five-year plan they would be ahead of schedule. But with Conte, Spurs are always against the clock. His contract runs only to the end of next season and even that looks a long way away. The possible 12-month extension to that contract even more so. There is no escaping the sense that however things are currently going in what has been an up-and-down five months he has always had and will always have one eye on the exit door. Spurs will always be in this curious stalled position while Conte is manager. He’s not going to instantly turn them into top-level contenders again because nobody could, but any improvements he does make – and there have been plenty – are caveated into oblivion by the near-certain knowledge that he won’t be around to finish the job. Under Conte, Spurs are far better than they were without him, but it all feels oddly directionless. He is laying solid foundations for a palace that will never be built. Under Pochettino, Spurs would at the very least have the prospect of a manager who might still be around to finish what he started. And even if it did go horribly wrong, as the “never go back” truism and the fact this is Spurs suggest is quite likely, the closure that would provide – even if painful – is something both club and manager need to properly move on. It’s not as strong as the case from the heart, admittedly, but it’s there. There’s no denying an element of Tobias Funke “but it might work for us” to it all. Yet it’s hardly damp-eyed delusion to look at Conte and Pochettino and conclude that both men are probably better suited to the other’s job. And even then, wanting to stick with Conte is a perfectly viable position that it should be entirely possible for Spurs fans or anyone else to hold without having to denigrate what Pochettino achieved and could still offer. At the very, very least, Pochettino’s likely availability and keenness given the closing-off of alternative avenues offers the security of a better and cheaper back-up option than Spurs could realistically hope for should Conte’s wandering eye take him elsewhere.

https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-juan-mata-shows-man-united-wasted-beautiful-old-trafford-swansong,Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong,"Juan Mata came, he conquered, and was forgotten about. The ‘Wizard’s’ last home game for Manchester United emphasised his misspent quality. For Manchester United – a club in turmoil, in need of calm heads, desperate for humility amid the arrogance, quality amid the mediocre – to hand Juan Mata his first Premier League start of the season in May is an absolute nonsense. The ‘Wizard’, denied legendary status in the Premier League through Red Devil mismanagement and ill-thought-out strategy, trotted around Old Trafford on Monday, working hard, creating and – perhaps most importantly – caring, to give the United fans a final glimpse of what they should have seen far more of in seven-and-a-half years of wasted talent. Mata arrived at the club having won back-to-back player of the year awards with Chelsea, as one of the Premier League’s foremost creators. He contributed the same number of assists (32) in two-and-half seasons at Chelsea as he has in the rest of his decade-long stint in the English top flight. He very nearly surpassed his Chelsea tally on Monday. It was prime Mata. Having wandered over to the left wing from his floating No.10 role, he beautifully cushioned a volley to Bruno Fernandes on halfway, beat the offside trap to spin in behind, received the return ball, before weighting a cross perfectly into Cristiano Ronaldo’s path. Had CR7 held his run by half a second, Mata’s brilliance would not have been in vain. And that is, in a way, an excellent summary of his United career, as Ronaldo – like his club – failed to take advantage of Mata’s quality. As Gary Neville referenced on commentary, the signing of Mata in January 2014 is in hindsight seen as the first of many signs of post-Fergie fuzzy-thinking. Having signed Marouane Fellaini six months before, David Moyes opted for the polar opposite as his second and final signing. Neither the Belgian brute nor the diminutive graduate of the Real Madrid academy were midfielders like any other in the preceding 20 years at Old Trafford, and have since been deemed unsuited to the hustle and bustle ‘attack, attack, attack’ of United. That speaks to perhaps the biggest problem at United in Mata’s time at the club – the obsession to cling to the coattails of Sir Alex Ferguson and maintain a style of football they’ve never got close to matching. Mata, and many signings since, haven’t been a good fit for that United, but maybe, just maybe, it’s the attempted style that’s been the greatest hindrance to the club’s progress, rather than the undoubtedly talented footballers that have failed to reach the heights they scaled at other clubs. Having said that, this victory over Brentford, Mata’s only start of the season, which admittedly felt a bit like a testimonial, was as close to a Sir Alex Ferguson-like performance as any we’ve seen this term. They broke quickly, with Mata, Fernandes and Ronaldo laying balls off smartly, accurately and running beyond each other. It was – and this hasn’t been the case for far too long – entertaining football. And entertainment has been the name of Juan Mata’s game in the Premier League. He’s put smiles on the faces of fans and teammates alike with unlikely assists, delicate touches and stunning long-range strikes. But most of those fond memories came in Chelsea blue, before a United career blighted by managers who failed to appreciate what he could do if they used him effectively. He leaves the Premier League with his head held high but with an irrefutable sense offrustration at what could have been.  ",positive,manchester united,2
https://www.football365.com/news/manchester-united-treble-liverpool-quadruple-mediawatch-stan-collymore,Who thinks the Manchester United Treble beats a Liverpool Quadruple?,"Stan Collymore, that’s who, though we think it’s largely because Stan Collymore was playing in 1999. Hit Quad Mediawatch had to check that Stan Collymore is actually only 51 after reading his latest ‘it were better in the olden days’ column in the Daily Mirror. His contention is that actually, Liverpool winning the Quadruple – literally never achieved before in football – would not be that impressive in the grand scheme of things. Of course, it would be a ‘fantastic achievement’ but ‘it won’t be any greater than Tottenham’s Double in 1960-61, Arsenal’s in 1970-71, or Liverpool’s in 1985-86’. We’re fascinated to hear how four trophies are actually no better than two, apart from ‘because it were better in the olden days’. We’re fascinated to hear how Arsenal’s 1970-71 side – who crashed out of the League Cup and Europe – are actually the equal of a team that wins all four trophies available at a time when they are up against the greatest club side of the last decade. We’re fascinated to hear how Liverpool’s 1985/86 side – barred from Europe but beaten by mid-table QPR in the League Cup –are actually the equal of a team that wins all four trophies available at a time when they are up against the greatest club side of the last decade. And then comes ‘Manchester United’s Treble in 1998-99 which, pound for pound, would still be the greatest achievement of all’. Why? Even the staunchest United fan would have to agree that four is a bigger number than three. United won the title with 79 points, a total surpassed by Liverpool and Manchester City this season with several games to spare. They also won the FA Cup and the Champions League but they lost in the third round of the League Cup. And yet that is still the better achievement than winning all four trophies? Because everything was better when Stan was playing? Collymore offers literally no explanation why United winning three trophies is better than Liverpool potentially winning four, other than a lack of ‘financial doping’, which kind of ignores two things: 1) United spent rather a lot of money to win those trophies and 2) The ‘financial doping’ of Manchester City, United and Chelsea in modern times makes it even more remarkable if Liverpool win four trophies. He then writes that when he played, ‘Matt Le Tissier spent his career with the Saints, but he’d have been taken on by one of the big boys after a couple of years these days’, to which we offer the words ‘Harry’ and ‘Kane’. We could also point out that Le Tissier turned down several moves away from Southampton but actually, we have already given that argument more credence than it deserves. ‘Spurs, Arsenal and Kenny Dalglish’s Liverpool all hit the heights with smaller squads than Jurgen Klopp’s Reds and City have at their disposal today’. They hit smaller heights with smaller squads at a time when all their rivals had smaller squads too; Spurs played 49 games to win their double and Liverpool have played 56 games already. You’re comparing apples with oranges and deciding that pineapples are better.  Done Ron Ron Ron ‘At least you can rely on Cristiano Ronaldo to lift the spirits,’ writes Neil Custis in The Sun. ‘A sparkling display, capped by his 24th goal of the season from the penalty spot, gave Manchester United fans something to cheer. In fact, he has probably given them the only things to cheer this season.’ Is this the same Ronaldo and indeed the same Neil Custis that collided to bring us these words in February? ‘The truth that is now staring everyone in the face, and clearly Ronaldo himself, is that his days as a top-class footballer are over. ‘It has been an admirable battle against father time but he is now losing it.’ ‘Losing it’ and yet now, less than three months later (and three months older for Ronaldo), ‘they need him still, even at 37, as they look to the future’. But, but, but… ‘The problem, though, is that when the ball is at his feet, or on his head, there is no magic any more, it has all gone.’ It’s almost like – and stop me if this is blowing your minds – Ronaldo had a blip in form at the same time as Manchester United were utterly atrocious and he is now neither completely finished nor the future for United. But why acknowledge middle ground when you can lurch wildly between extremes? Somebody give Custis one of those heated lavender packs to treat his whiplash.   Fergie timeHeadline on The Sun website as Ken Lawrence writes about – and we had to check this – a 3-0 victory: ‘Man Utd verdict: Final home game played against backdrop of depression and disillusion, it’s a far cry from Fergie days’ It’s been nine f***ing years; get over it. ‘For the last home match of the season came agains the backdrop of depression and disillusion at a club that under Sir Alex Ferguson ruled the Premier League and on a couple of occasions did so in Europe too. ‘This is a very different United to the one Fergie guided to 13 titles, two Champions League successes and so much more silver wear.’ ‘Silver wear’ has made us laugh at least (it’s the pick of about 427 mistakes, including a description of Ronaldo as a ‘waining star’ and a brief discussion of ‘parametres’), but the rest of this is utterly miserable. It is a ‘very different United’ but how many times can that be written? Thousands, it seems. Manchester United have not had a very good season, but a 3-0 win over Brentford gave Lawrence the chance to write about the farewell of Juan Mata or maybe the promise of Anthony Elanga. That he watched that victory and essentially wrote ‘this Manchester United is not as good as Fergie’s Manchester United’ says a great deal about tabloid journalism and its obsession with a past in which they were still relevant.  Do one, Ron, RonKen Lawrence on The Sun website: ‘Ronaldo does not fit those parametres no matter that he had a sparkle about him against Brentford in what was his best all – round performance in months. ‘And in those months there have been hints for months that without Champions League football next season he will head off. ‘He certainly won’t want to be involved in the Europa League or perish the thought, playing in Europe’s third tier Conference.’ Ken Lawrence on the back page of The Sun: ‘CRISTIANO RONALDO dropped his biggest hint yet that he wants to stay at Manchester United – after mouthing: I’m not finished.’ That all seems perfectly clear.  Down, down, deeper and downElsewhere in Stan Collymore land, he seems to think that Burnley’s survival absolutely would not reflect badly on the recently sacked Sean Dyche, in fact ‘the opposite because every player at Turf Moor is a Dyche player’, and yet Leeds’ relegation would be down to ‘the over-egging of the Marcelo Bielsa pudding’. Now try and hold both of those opinions at the same time without getting a throbbing headache.  ",positive,manchester united,7

The Dutchman was confirmed as the new permanent Red Devils boss last month with interim manager Ralf Rangnick making way at the end of the season. Man Utd beat Brentford 3-0 on Monday night to move six points ahead of seventh-placed West Ham – who have a game in hand on Rangnick’s men – but it’s unlikely that that the Red Devils will now finish higher than sixth position. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? Ten Hag has a huge job on his hands to get Man Utd competing for Premier League titles again and Neville has set out his timeline of expectations for the Dutchman. Neville said on Sky Sports: “I said four to five years to win a title and I don’t disagree with Jamie’s timeline of Champions League in the first two seasons while he’s sorting the recruitment out and getting used to the club. “Third season getting very close, I think to the point whereby the club have got confidence and won a trophy maybe. “And then that fourth year really is where they have to win a title, fifth year. That’s where I think really you’re looking at the moment realistically. “We all hope he comes in and blows everyone away and that Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola blow up somehow. “But they’re not blowing up are they? They’re achieving the same numbers of points year in year out so if their consistency remains, which there’s no reason to say it won’t then Ten Hag’s got a massive job to make up that points gap.” Year 1-2 | #UCL qualification Year 3 | Title challengers Year 4-5 | Premier League Winners 🏆 Gary Neville lays out the timeline that he expects Erik ten Hag to achieve things at Manchester United. pic.twitter.com/yd4KtSvhgc — Football Daily (@footballdaily) May 2, 2022 Fellow pundit Roy Keane thinks the main thing Man Utd need to improve on is their recruitment with a lack of the right characters in the Old Trafford dressing room. “Whatever their problems, they have to look at where Man City are, where Liverpool are,” Keane added. “Man City, Liverpool and these other teams aren’t going to take it easy over the summer. They’re going to reinvest, get players in and get stronger. “Klopp might stay on, Pep might stay on. It comes down to recruitment: getting the right players in and getting players out of the door, because the last few years just haven’t been good enough. “How many times can you say it? The biggest frustration for me, when they’ve had these disappointments, is the reaction they’ve shown. There’s been a real lack of leadership, not enough characters in that dressing room.”  ",positive,manchester united,2

Manchester United reach the end of the 2021/22 season in a state of flux. They’ve played 22 games in all competitions since the start of this calendar year and they’ve won just eight of them, with only three of those wins having come in the last two months. At the start of the year, the club had three easily identifiable aims for the second half of this season: the FA Cup, the Champions League and qualifying for next year’s Champions League. But four months into the new year, and regardless of a stroll-a-thon win against a Brentford side that didn’t seem to want to push them too hard, any optimistic predictions for the end of this season now lie in tatters. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong United were eliminated by Middlesbrough in the FA Cup and Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, while their involvement in the race for fourth place in the Premier League may still be mathematically possible in theory but would depend on such an improbable sequence of results that it’s fair to completely disregard their chances as anything other than fanciful. The potential for a break in the clouds hovering over Old Trafford comes in the form of new manager Erik Ten Hag, who will take control of the team this summer, but the carousel of accusation has long left behind the notion that the fortunes of a football club in the modern era can be changed for the better by the appointment of one person. The problems at Manchester United run deeper than just the manager, and it was never very likely that the appointment of a new one would cure what ails the club. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wasn’t the only member of the Manchester United management team to leave their position last year. Ed Woodward had to (eventually) fall on his sword over his involvement in the European Super League fiasco, though he didn’t leave his position until the start of February, and now Matt Judge, who’d previously been described as Woodward’s ‘right hand’, has resigned from his position as Manchester United’s director of football negotiations. This follows the decision of the club to appoint Richard Arnold as the new chief executive in January and then John Murtough as director of football in February. Judge, who is currently working out his notice period with the club, will not be missed by the club’s supporters. As the man responsible for negotiating transfers and contracts for Manchester United, Judge became one of the most influential people working behind the scenes at Old Trafford, but after what has come to be considered transfer failure after transfer failure, United fans seem pretty much agreed that just about anybody would be better. Woodward and Judge were, after all, the pair who came up with the wheeze of extending player contracts as a way of maintaining asset value on business spreadsheets, which many believe has been a key reason behind the United squad becoming so unbalanced, while reaffirming to critics the fundamental differences between running Manchester United for the benefit of the stock market over just getting on with being, well, a football club.  It has been suggested that the reason for Judge’s departure at this time is related to Murtough being promoted over his head and cutting off his direct contact with Arnold, though it should be added that most of this does at least seem to be passing fairly amicably, which in itself might be considered somewhat surprising when we recall the extent of the factionalisation of the United dressing room and the steady torrent of leaks that has been flowing from behind those doors over the course of this season. United supporters certainly seem to know who they want to replace him; Paul Mitchell has been earning admiring glances for years. After moving from Southampton to Spurs with Mauricio Pochettino in 2014, he left White Hart Lane two years later to work first with RB Leipzig and then with Monaco as a sporting director in a position that he has held since 2020; Newcastle were said to be considering his services at the end of last year before settling on Dan Ashworth instead, a decision which isn’t exactly going as Newcastle might have hoped. Mitchell is understood to have a close relationship with Ralf Rangnick from his time in Leipzig. He was constantly linked with a move to Old Trafford when the club didn’t even have a sporting director, and now that Murtough is in that position – with Darren Fletcher as technical director – the fans are clamouring for him to be offered Judge’s old position. After all, Judge isn’t the only person from this side of the club to have left his position in the last few months; chief scout Jim Lawlor and head of global scouting Marcel Bout have also departed. But this might not be straightforward. The Mirror has reported that, ‘The Englishman [Mitchell] has been tempted to stay by the offer of a sizeable budget to spend at Monaco in the upcoming window’, based on reporting in Foot Mercato, which claims that Chelsea are also interested in his services. There is also little to suggest that Mitchell is unhappy in Monaco, while others might argue that, although his record with Spurs – where he was behind the decisions to take Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Toby Alderweireld to the club – was excellent, his record at Monaco has not quite left him above criticism. And as ever with Manchester United, all of this raises as many questions as it answers. If Murtough and Fletcher are now running the club’s recruitment, where would Mitchell fit into the equation? If Darren Fletcher is a ‘technical director’, then what is he doing in the dugout on a Saturday afternoon? What exactly is his role? Because even his own attempts to clarify it haven’t exactly sounded convincing. But those questions will keep coming. How do Manchester United plan to attract the elite-level players to which they believe themselves to be entitled if they can’t offer Champions League football? Where does Ralf Rangnick fit into all of this, especially considering that he will now be mixing his consultancy duties with being the head coach of the Austrian national team? Can any new structure or head coach change the culture of leaking to the press which has been relentless this season from a hopelessly factionalised dressing room? And ultimately, will Joel Glazer still be having the final say on all of these changes? Time is of the essence.It’s not that long until the end of the season and the reopening of the transfer window, and few would argue that Manchester United’s squad doesn’t need major work. Somewhere in this thicket of names there may be a combination that works, but while the departure of Matt Judge was necessary (if anything, it’s surprising that he stayed beyond the departure of Woodward), it doesn’t add much to the club ahead of what is likely to be an extremely busy summer. For many Manchester United supporters, the likely truth remains that the club cannot be truly reformed until the Glazer family have left. But with that looking no more likely now than at any other time over the last 17 years, supporters are left hoping against logic that this time the leopards running their clubs might finally change their spots. The post-Ferguson transition is now completing its ninth year without the club’s fortunes having substantially changed, and promises that this time things will definitely be different should probably be taken with a pinch of salt.

There should be two or three new strikers next season, it’s pretty obvious.” CR7 in front of the Stretford End 🎯 👏 @Cristiano #MUFC | #MUNCHE pic.twitter.com/Qrnd0G1hKx — Manchester United (@ManUtd) April 28, 2022 On summer recruitment, he added: “If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window. “They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks. “This shows it is possible that this can happen and it would not necessarily need three, four years in order to do that.” On the appointment of Ten Hag, Rangnick continued: “Knowing Erik will be the manager, with a good recruitment process and bringing in the right players, I’m very positive the supporters and the media will be able to see a better team and, at the end, hopefully a better position in the league. “There are quite a few good examples in the league with when Jurgen Klopp came to Liverpool, Pep Guardiola to Manchester City, Thomas Tuchel came to Chelsea – yes, he came in the middle of the season and inherited a top-quality squad, but you still need to win the Champions League. “If you know what you’re looking for, the profiles of the different positions you need, it shouldn’t hopefully take too long.”  ",positive,manchester united,2

It was confirmed last month that Ten Hag will become the new permanent Red Devils boss once the current campaign ends with interim manager Ralf Rangnick heading into a consultancy role. Rangnick had sparked rumours there could be a major overhaul of the playing staff in the next transfer window when he claimed there could be as many as ten new signings in the summer. Manchester United scout watches £100m target subbed at HT; Everton’s Richarlison hope However, a report in ESPN last week insisted that Man Utd have moved to distance themselves from Rangnick’s claims and instead expect to sign three players. Southampton midfielder Ward-Prowse, who has ten goals and seven assists in all competitions this season, is one player who has been linked with a move to Man Utd this week and former Chelsea striker Cascarino thinks he would be a good signing. “It was interesting to see James Ward-Prowse linked with a move to Manchester United,” Cascarino toldThe Times. “At 27, the Southampton midfielder is entering the peak years of his career and if he is not content with being a one-club man, now may be the time for a big move. “Ward-Prowse is so much more than simply a dead-ball expert (though there are few better than him from corners and free kicks). He is brilliant at keeping the ball and helping his team dictate play. “I can see why Erik ten Hag may fancy him.” Redknapp recently told Ten Hag to sign “good, honest pros” as his priority in the summer transfer window after rumours of unrest in the Man Utd dressing room this season. “Ten Hag will need to have a look at the players he wants to keep,” Redknapp toldSky Sports. “As bad as things are at the moment, things can change quickly with one or two good signings. “Who do you get? It’s not easy but the ideal one is Declan Rice, and West Ham fans won’t thank me for this. “You want good, honest pros who can really play, people like Rice. That’s the market they’ve got to be looking for, that can work hard in training and play the right way. “Could you go and get Harry Kane from Tottenham this summer? I’m not saying he’s going to leave but that’s the sort of player you are going to need, players that will come in and set the right culture.” ",positive,manchester united,2

WARD-PROWSE TO MANCHESTER Free-kick whizz-kid James Ward-Prowse has caught the attention of both Manchester United and Manchester City, who are reportedly interested in luring him away from St Mary’s this summer. United want to land two new central midfielders as part of a summer overhaul under new manager Erik ten Hag, and Ward-Prowse is among those on the club’s wishlist, according to the Daily Star. And it’s claimed the Red Devils will face direct competition with rivals Manchester City, as Pep Guardiola is a ‘huge admirer’ of the England international. The City boss described the 27-year-old – who has scored from four free-kick’s this season – as the best dead-ball specialist in world football and has been impressed by his box-to-box displays and incredible fitness record. Newcastle, Tottenham and Arsenal are also ‘tracking developments closely, while Aston Villa failed with a £25m bid for the midfielder last summer. The report concedes that Ward-Prowse is settled at Southampton but may decide to switch to a club playing European football to improve his chances of going to the World Cup in Qatar. It’s thought he would cost up to £60m.  MOUNTING CONCERN Chelsea are a bit concerned Mason Mount could be tempted to leave the club for Liverpool or Manchester City, who could take advantage of the club’s ownership crisis. It looks as though what the proces to replace Roman Abramovich is nearing its end, though it’s felt that way for a while. Despite Jim Ratcliffe throwing a lot of late cash in an attempt to buy the club, it appears Todd Boehly’s consortium are on the verge of tying up the deal. But for now, Chelsea are unable to offer their players new contracts. Mount, despite his importance to the club, is currently one of the lowest paid players in Thomas Tuchel’s squad, on around £70,000 per week. He has two years left on his current deal, but The Sun claim ‘concerns are growing’ that he could be tempted away by a more lucrative contract, with both Jurgen Klopp and Pep Gurdiola ‘major fans’ of the 23-year-old. Chelsea apparently planned to open talks of a long-term deal before Abramovich was hit by the sanctions, but they will have to bide their time with the future of the club still up in the air.  BUMPER JAMES DEAL Offering Mount a new deal should undoubtedly be a priority when the new owners are in place, and among the other players the club are desperate to keep is Reece James. 90min claim Chelsea have made the right-back’s future a priority as they look to ward off interest from Real Madrid. James has become a key member of Tuchel’s side in the last 18 months, registering five goals and six assists from wing-back this term, and the club is ready to offer him a ‘new bumper deal’ as reward for his fine performances.

https://www.football365.com/news/decision-time-one-loanee-dilemma-saliba-van-de-beek?utm_source=Recirculation&utm_medium=WP_Related_Articles_Unit&utm_campaign=Benchmark,Decision time: One loanee per club sparking a dilemma,"A genuinely interminable international break plus a France debut for William Saliba was all the encouragement we needed to embark on a quest to identify one player per Premier League club currently out on loan who, for better or worse, has given his parent club a decision to make… Arsenal: William Saliba The Gunners have a whole gaggle of assorted players out on loan, and, despite the intriguing existence of Folarin Balogun as a striker whose Arsenal contract isn’t about to expire, the most interesting loanee is once again William Saliba. He was here last year and if anything the intrigue has only grown. He has now had three hugely successful years as an Arsenal player; he just hasn’t spent any of them at Arsenal. Loans at St Etienne, Nice and now Marseille have even earned him his first caps for France. Friendly caps might not seem all that big a deal, but winning a cap for France as a centre-back is just about the toughest task in the entire sport; Aymeric Laporte found it so difficult he had to become Spanish instead; Ibrahima Konate still hasn’t managed it. Saliba, the man apparently surplus to requirements at Arsenal, has done it. He is understandably happy and settled at Marseille, where he plays every game, and a return to Arsenal would mean fighting for a place with Gabriel and Ben White. A lot depends on the player, but with only two years left on the five-year contract Saliba signed as a teenager, Arsenal are now very much at the point where it’s time to sh*t or get off the pot.  Aston Villa: Matt Targett One of many players currently on loan – along with Keinan Davis, Trezeguet, Anwar El Ghazi and Frederic Guilbert – who Villa are seemingly happy to move on permanently in the summer. Targett is key, because it appears relatively straightforward to do a deal with Newcastle that suits all parties while also bringing in a reasonably sizeable transfer fee – something in the order of £15m has been mooted – to help bankroll Steven Gerrard’s ambitious summer masterplan of spending £60m on Kalvin Phillips.  Brentford: Marcus Forss The Finland striker was in the squad for every one of Brentford’s first 23 Premier League games. But he started just one of those, getting off the bench in just six others and never for more than 30-odd minutes. He scored no goals. He went back to the Championship on loan with Hull in January and has managed just a single goal in eight appearances for the Tigers. He’s still got four years left on his Brentford contract; it’s hard to see how he can be part of what will almost certainly again be a Premier League squad next year, but you can also see why he’d be reluctant to leave the security of that long-term contract. Another loan?  Brighton: Kjell Scherpen The Seagulls have 13 players out on loan like some kind of petrodollar superclub. At least one of these will definitely be in the squad next season, surely – striker Deniz Undav who has scored only one league goal fewer for shock Belgian league title contenders Union Saint Gilloise before and after a January sale-and-return move than his new Brighton team-mates have managed to put together in the Premier League. A more interesting one might be giant back-up keeper Scherpen, who might have been doing a more important off-field role in the first half of the season than many realised. Scherpen spent the first half of the season watching Robert Sanchez be very good indeed and is now on loan while Sanchez makes repeated bollocks of things as Brighton’s season threatens to end with the sort of whimper that can have alarming knock-on effects the following year if not addressed. Even if he doesn’t play a single game, Scherpen might be worth keeping around the place.  Burnley: Bailey Peacock-Farrell We’re not spoiled for choice here. It’s a third-choice goalkeeper or a fourth-choice goalkeeper. Let’s go with Peacock-Farrell who is doing a decent enough job in nets for fallen giants Sheffield Wednesday as they look to clamber out of League One. Our main observation is that it doesn’t matter how many games of football he plays or at what level. No matter how high his career goes we will never, ever, ever accept that Bailey Peacock-Farrell is not in fact the name of a rugby player who, after six successful years in Super League, crosses codes to join Bath or whatever and make eight appearances for England in the 15-man game.  Chelsea: Conor Gallagher There is not a single Chelsea player currently on loan at Vitesse, which is perhaps why the whole world currently seems to be desperately trying to spin itself off its axis. It’s just not right or normal, is it? Chelsea do, though, have about a million players out on loan as is customary. Now the whole global unpleasantness is of particular relevance to Chelsea, who may not in fact have any choice to make over who stays or goes or heads out on loan. They may not even exist next season. Probably they will, though. And probably they will get to decide these things. Which means a decision to make on Gallagher, who has been one of the most exciting and enjoyable players in the Premier League this season. We’re big fans of players who get to that level and still seem to visibly enjoy playing the game. Palace would, clearly, dearly love to keep him and you do get a keen sense that this is now someone who needs to be playing regularly. You can’t keep him on the bench, released only for the odd runaround in a Carabao or non-vital European game. He’s tasted regular top-level football now and found it entirely to his liking. At the very least, you’d think he needs to spend another year on loan playing all the football.  Crystal Palace: Luke Plange Palace only have two players currently out on loan and it’s fair to say their summer thoughts might be rather more exercised by what happens next to the player they currently have on loan (see above). Anyway, the two options are a) 23-year-old American Jacob Montes who has spent the entirety of his slightly odd one-year Palace contract pulling up no trees in a pair of half-season loans in the Belgian second division and therefore b) Luke Plange, the teenager whose breakthrough at Derby convinced Palace to make a buy-and-return move in January. Palace have a bit of form for developing Football League talent into Premier League players, but you’d imagine that’s probably a way off yet. A good Championship loan seems the likeliest option next season.  Everton: Moise Kean In theory, he’s still in the first year of a two-year loan at Juventus with an obligation to buy at the end of it. In theory. In reality, Juventus weren’t right sure a while ago and since signing Dusan Vlahovic are less convinced still about the merits of Kean who has scored just four goals in 24 Serie A games this season. All the noise suggests Juventus are looking to get out of the current arrangement and send Kean back to Goodison this summer, an outcome that we have to imagine absolutely nobody else involved wants. So whatever happens next it should be fun to see what comes of it all.  Leeds: Helder Costa In and out of the side at Valencia but has made no secret of the fact he’s happier in Spain and would like to make his move permanent if everyone else is up for it. They probably will be. “I feel better here, I came from a not so good situation (at Leeds). But Valencia have given me the opportunity to relaunch my career and I think this is the ideal place to do that,” Costa toldSuper Sport last year.   Leicester City: Dennis Praet A victim of the Dreaded Metatarsal, which has kept him out of the Torino side for a couple of months at a frustrating time and appears likely now to be a season-ender. The Belgian is apparently happy in Turin and keen to stay, but the Italian side seem keen to use his injury as a means to drive down the agreed £12.5m option price in the current loan arrangement. Reports from the Italian end suggest Torino might favour another loan over an outright purchase but, with just two year left on his Leicester contract, you’d imagine the Foxes would want something more concrete built into that. An obligation that kicks in once a set number of appearances is reached or some such thing. We don’t know. We’re not contract negotiators.  Liverpool: Nathaniel Phillips It’s between Phillips and Neco Williams here. Both will still have three years left on their contracts in the summer. Both are on loan at high-flying Championship clubs. Both have obvious talent. Both face significant top-quality barriers to their first-team progression at Anfield. But it’s Phillips, five years Williams’ senior, for whom the clock is more conspicuously ticking. Phillips did an admirable job in that desperate half-season for Liverpool last year when all their other centre-backs fell over, but is that situation going to present itself again? Should Bournemouth confirm promotion back to the Premier League, and that appears almost certain now given their sizeable cushion in both points and games in hand over third-placed Luton, you’d imagine both player and club might be keen on a more permanent arrangement. Ticklish thing there is that longish contract, half a season of decent Premier League football behind him and apparent absence of any option in his loan contract. What would Liverpool want for him? £15m is a number that has been touted, and if anything you’d be surprised if it was that low really.  Manchester City: Pedro Porro Just the 13 City players currently plying their trade elsewhere at the mo. Spain right-back Porro is perhaps the most interesting of those, currently in the second half of a successful two-year stint in Lisbon with Sporting that has already brought one league title and could yet bring another if a six-point gap to Porto can be overturned. Eight goals and nine assists from 65 games played predominantly at right wing-back are eye-catching numbers.  Manchester United: Donny van de Beek The arrival of a new manager in the summer means all things are a bit up in the air for United’s current loanees, who could suddenly find themselves far more in favour when a new man arrives. We suspect minds have been made up now, though, about Anthony Martial. Van de Beek is an intriguing one, though. Especially if United’s new manager does turn out to be his former Ajax gaffer Erik Ten Hag in spite of Louis van Gaal’s mischief-making. Van de Beek is clearly a talent, but whether he can crack it here remains in some doubt. What is not is that he is yet to be presented with an environment to categorically prove it one way or the other. In hindsight – and, if we’re honest, foresight – packing him off to Frank Lampard’s Everton Circus might not have been a brilliant idea. We’re still really none the wiser about him.  Newcastle: Freddie Woodman If you were loaned out by Newcastle in January then really it’s a pretty clear hint about where your future lies. For Woodman, who played four Premier League games at the start of the season, it’s meant sitting on the bench for promotion-chasing Bournemouth as back-up to Mark Travers. It is the seventh loan of his Newcastle career, and he has one year left on his contract at St James’ Park. At 25, it’s surely time for a permanent move to go and be first choice somewhere even if it means dropping down a tier or two.  Norwich: Todd Cantwell Like Norwich themselves, he’s pretty good at getting into the Premier League but not so good at staying there. With his current loan club Bournemouth set to once again swap divisions with parent club Norwich, the logical conclusion is surely for Cantwell to go back to Norwich and complete what would be the genuinely novel achievement of a third successive promotion from the Championship. Bournemouth do, though, hold the option of making the move permanent and spoiling everything.  Southampton: Dan N’Lundulu Because there is literally nobody else other than a 23-year-old striker who scored two goals in 20 League One appearances across a pair of loans at first Lincoln and then Cheltenham before suffering a season-ending hamstring injury.  Tottenham: Bryan Gil Spurs have seven players out on loan, and with most of them the future looks pretty clear one way or the other. It would be a major surprise were Tanguy Ndombele or Giovani Lo Celso to have futures in north London, which is a shame but also probably for the best. Neither has been missed since January. Jack Clarke was Spurs’ attempt at a moneyball signing and it’s not worked out. Cameron Carter-Vickers is likely to make his loan move to Celtic permanent. Pape Sarr, the teenage midfield sensation bought from and loaned straight back to Metz last summer, will require a decision but not a final one. The suspicion there is that he’ll spend pre-season with Spurs before either being brought into the first-team squad or sent on another loan. Spurs, you’d imagine, would prefer that to be to either a bottom-half Premier League club or ambitious Championship side (let’s face it, it will probably be Norwich) to find out how he goes in English football. But the big decision probably regards Bryan Gil, the skilful yet painfully lightweight Spanish winger who just looked nowhere near the right sort of fit for English football. His current loan in Spain cannot tell us much but he is the one player on the Spurs list where all things are possible. This time next year he could just as easily be a Spurs first-team regular, starring for Valencia in La Liga having joined on a permanent basis, doing bits for Crystal Palace on loan or languishing at Tottenham having subsisted on the occasional Europa night which is no longer an option because Spurs have found some new and absurdly Spursy way to get knocked out. Watford: Philip Zinckernagel The Hornets look to be on to a good thing whatever happens here thanks to Zinckernagel’s Nottingham Forest exploits. He’s scored five goals and laid on nine assists to help Forest into the play-off picture, but it’s his eye-catching displays in Forest’s fabulous FA Cup run that really make you take notice. If Watford stay up, then he has shown he can play at Premier League level. If they go down, then he has shown he can propel a Championship promotion bid. And if Watford go down and Forest go up, then they might be able to sell him for a nice price. Win, win, win. If you ignore the whole ‘relegation’ stuff, which is not a win and frankly a bit of a downer.  West Ham: Conor Coventry Because he’s the only West Ham player currently out on loan. They really don’t have a very big squad. The 22-year-old spent the first half of this season in the lower reaches of the Championship, making 12 appearances – mainly off the bench – for Peterborough, and is now in League One with MK Dons. Has just a year left on his contract at West Ham, for whom he has made three brief appearances off the bench in the League Cup.  Wolves: Adama Traore All appeared sorted when he set off to Barcelona initially on loan with a £29m option to make it permanent in the summer. Four assists in 10 games have gone some way to confirming the suspicion that his end-product stats might improve away from Wolves but there is yet a fly in the ointment thanks to Barcelona’s much-publicised financial problems making that £29m a bit steep for them. Wolves have made it clear that Traore is done at Molineux unless there’s a surprise U-turn on a new contract and even then Wolves may feel he’s burned his bridges. Spurs were keen in January, but might have moved on now. Could get tricky, this. ",positive,manchester united,1

Even when he’s playing through the middle, I said he plays like a child [againstLiverpool]. “It’s like he’s not learnt from the game.

Okay it wasn’t great service, but the one or two bits he got where he was in on goal and a poor touch. “Defensively, we were trying to help Maguire out here before the match, give him a little bit of PR, but the last goal, Maguire’s passing and defending, not acceptable, not good enough for Man United.”  ",positive,manchester united,1

Fans showed their anger at the Glazer family as their team earned themselves a 3-0 win against Brentford at Old Trafford. Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane netted for Man Utd on a rare night of joy for Rangnick. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? The interim manager’s inability to get a consistent tune out of the squad means they are set to miss out on Champions League qualification and he admitted he was disappointed that they did not play like that more often. “I think tonight we probably showed one of our best performances in the last six months in possession of the ball,” Rangnick said. “We were in control of the game in most parts. We still had a few gaps defensively but in general I was pleased with the performance we showed tonight. “The season is not yet over, we have another two games to play away at Brighton and Crystal Palace. “We have to divide (my time) into different parts. We had very good games, very good performance to start with and in-between, the home games against West Ham, Tottenham, away at Leeds. “But what we lacked in general was just consistency. At times we had problems to score goals. We scored three today, we scored four against Leeds. “To start with it was important to stabilise the team and help them to concede not that many goals, but what was lacking was consistency. “We also lost quite a few important players. This also didn’t help us. “Obviously I am not completely happy with those six months. I would have expected us to qualify for Champions League. This was the goal that we had but in the end we were just not consistent enough.” Old Trafford said farewell to Rangnick and midfielder Nemanja Matic on Monday, with Juan Mata and Edinson Cavani also featuring before their expected summer exits. Rangnick admits he made a mistake in only handing Mata his first league start of the season on Monday – a night when fellow veteran Ronaldo shone in another man-of-the-match display. The 37-year-old moved onto 18 league goals for the season and his future will be of keen interest this summer as Erik ten Hag prepares to take over. “The way that he played again tonight, not only because he scored a goal, he also won the penalty, he also helped defensively tonight,” Rangnick said. “So, why should he not be a player that could still be part of the squad and help the team? “This is a question you have to ask Erik once he’s here and obviously it’s also important how Cristiano sees his role and his position.” Our last game of the season at Old Trafford.

In spells we were too hectic. “But OK, fair play to Man United. I think they hit a very high performance first half – some of their better performance that I have seen so far so they did well. “Second half much more the Brentford team I want to see, much more front footed. “We had momentum with chances and half chances and we were definitely on top and then we make a stupid mistake for the penalty, an unnecessary mistake and that of course killed the game off I would say. “If you want to win here at Old Trafford, we can’t make a penalty and concede on a set piece.”  ",positive,manchester united,2

The ‘Wizard’s’ last home game for Manchester United emphasised his misspent quality. For Manchester United – a club in turmoil, in need of calm heads, desperate for humility amid the arrogance, quality amid the mediocre – to hand Juan Mata his first Premier League start of the season in May is an absolute nonsense. The ‘Wizard’, denied legendary status in the Premier League through Red Devil mismanagement and ill-thought-out strategy, trotted around Old Trafford on Monday, working hard, creating and – perhaps most importantly – caring, to give the United fans a final glimpse of what they should have seen far more of in seven-and-a-half years of wasted talent. Mata arrived at the club having won back-to-back player of the year awards with Chelsea, as one of the Premier League’s foremost creators. He contributed the same number of assists (32) in two-and-half seasons at Chelsea as he has in the rest of his decade-long stint in the English top flight. He very nearly surpassed his Chelsea tally on Monday. It was prime Mata. Having wandered over to the left wing from his floating No.10 role, he beautifully cushioned a volley to Bruno Fernandes on halfway, beat the offside trap to spin in behind, received the return ball, before weighting a cross perfectly into Cristiano Ronaldo’s path. Had CR7 held his run by half a second, Mata’s brilliance would not have been in vain. And that is, in a way, an excellent summary of his United career, as Ronaldo – like his club – failed to take advantage of Mata’s quality. As Gary Neville referenced on commentary, the signing of Mata in January 2014 is in hindsight seen as the first of many signs of post-Fergie fuzzy-thinking. Having signed Marouane Fellaini six months before, David Moyes opted for the polar opposite as his second and final signing. Neither the Belgian brute nor the diminutive graduate of the Real Madrid academy were midfielders like any other in the preceding 20 years at Old Trafford, and have since been deemed unsuited to the hustle and bustle ‘attack, attack, attack’ of United. That speaks to perhaps the biggest problem at United in Mata’s time at the club – the obsession to cling to the coattails of Sir Alex Ferguson and maintain a style of football they’ve never got close to matching. Mata, and many signings since, haven’t been a good fit for that United, but maybe, just maybe, it’s the attempted style that’s been the greatest hindrance to the club’s progress, rather than the undoubtedly talented footballers that have failed to reach the heights they scaled at other clubs. Having said that, this victory over Brentford, Mata’s only start of the season, which admittedly felt a bit like a testimonial, was as close to a Sir Alex Ferguson-like performance as any we’ve seen this term. They broke quickly, with Mata, Fernandes and Ronaldo laying balls off smartly, accurately and running beyond each other. It was – and this hasn’t been the case for far too long – entertaining football. And entertainment has been the name of Juan Mata’s game in the Premier League. He’s put smiles on the faces of fans and teammates alike with unlikely assists, delicate touches and stunning long-range strikes. But most of those fond memories came in Chelsea blue, before a United career blighted by managers who failed to appreciate what he could do if they used him effectively.

The Italian was desperate for reinforcements last month at Tottenham but, after the club missed out on deals for Adama Traoreand Luis Diaz, they only brought in Juventus pair Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur on deadline day. On the same day Conte saw the club’s two most expensive players – Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso – leave on loan, with Dele Alli joining Everton on a free transfer and Bryan Gil going to Valencia less than six months after his £25m arrival from Sevilla. Premier League winners and losers A report has claimed that Harry Kane will only commit his future to Spurs if they back Conte in the transfer market and now Italian website Inter Live reckon they will do just that by trying to sign Inter Milan duoLautaro Martinez and Stefan de Vrij. Tottenham had lost three Premier League matches in a row before their dramatic late 3-2 victory over champions Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Their poor form and lack of activity in the January market seemed to have demoralised Conte in recent interviews but they bounced back to maintain the seven-point gap to fourth-placed Manchester United, who they have three games in hand on. And Inter Live insist that Conte now ‘expects signings of players ready to win’ in the summer transfer window if he is to remain as boss beyond the summer and De Vrij and Martinez tick those boxes. Conte won the Serie A title last season with the duo key cogs in his winning team and now it is claimed that Spurs are prepared to pay€90-100m in a double swoop for the Inter pair. However, it is understood that Tottenham would fall around €20m short of their valuation as the Nerazzurri ‘would ask for €110-120m for both of them’. Inter Live describe it as a ‘difficult operation’ for Spurs but that landing De Vrij and Martinez ‘would make the discontented Conte happy’. ",positive,manchester united,1

Meanwhile, Ralf Rangnick could return to Leipzig for a midfielder… LIVERPOOL KEEN ON CRANKY CAMAVINGA Eduardo Camavinga only joined Real Madrid in the summer, when Manchester United were thought to be interested in the France midfielder. But having struggled to secure a place in Carlo Ancelotti’s first XI, there is already talk of the teenager looking for another move. Camavinga has managed only six starts in all competitions for Real this season, which has prompted El Nacional to link him to Liverpool. Apparently, the 19-year-old ‘has a monumental rage’ over his situation at Real and is open to loan or permanent offers, and Jurgen Klopp is still keen to take the former Rennes star. Having done a deal to sign Camavinga in the summer which could cost them up to £35million, Real are said to want a profit on the midfielder.  Top 10 Under-21 Premier League stars of 2021  RANGNICK RETURNS TO LEIPZIG FOR MIDFIELDER United are also looking for midfielders, though not with replacing Paul Pogba in mind. Fabrizio Romano says the Red Devils’ renewal offer to Pogba is still on the table, where it has been since the summer. There are no negotiations with other clubs over a possible January sale, while Pogba is still said to be assessing his options. Indeed, the Mirror reports that if Pogba wants to leave United next month, he will have to push for a move. But Ralf Rangnick is still exploring the market for midfielders and the Mirror reckons the United boss could make contact with former club RB Leipzig to discuss a deal for Amadou Haidara.

De Vrij is entering the final 18 months of his contract at the San Siro, where he played for Conte before the manager moved on. The Sun rehashes a report from Swiss website 4-4-2.com that suggests Spurs are keen on Matthijs De Ligt – but they won’t pay the ridiculous release clause that comes into play next summer. De Ligt could leave Juventus for around £130million at the end of the season, with Barcelona and Chelsea interested. But those clubs too would also be looking to negotiate on that figure.

The Spaniard produced a good performance for the Red Devils on Monday as they beat Brentford 3-0 at Old Trafford with goals coming from Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane. Mata was making his first Premier League start of the campaign with the 34-year-old starting just three of his ten appearances in all competitions this term. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? The decision by interim boss Rangnick to start Mata frustrated Man Utd legend Keane who thinks the German is “giving players a run-out for the wrong reasons”. “I’m surprised. It’s his first start of the season, he obviously knows he’s leaving the club. There’s some loyalty there, giving him a run-out. “He came on for 20 minutes the other night but starting a game is much different. It tells you where the mindset is. They are giving players a run-out for the wrong reasons.” 🗣 “I’m surprised.” Roy Keane says he wasn’t expecting Juan Mata to start over Marcus Rashford this evening for Manchester United. pic.twitter.com/MYVJQzJ9BS — Football Daily (@footballdaily) May 2, 2022 But Rangnick was pleased with Mata’s performance against Brentford and when asked whether he could’ve used him more often, the Man Utd boss replied:“Yes, maybe it was the first game he played from the beginning, [but it] also had to do with the opposition in this position and in the last couple of weeks he was one of the players who showed in training how professional he is and how much he loves the game. “He had moments when he played like a magician.” Mata is out of contract at Man Utd at the end of the season and looks almost certain that he will leave the club in the summer. On Mata’s future, Rangnick added: “I don’t know [if he’s leaving]. He hasn’t confirmed that but it is possible. “It was an important night for players who have been here quite a long time and played well for the club.” Phil Jones, who has also struggled for game time in recent seasons, got on the pitch for the final 15 minutes in what is likely to be his Old Trafford farewell with Man Utd finishing the season with away trips to Brighton and Crystal Palace. “For personal reasons he didn’t train a lot, yesterday was the first,” said Rangnick of Jones. “He asked me to allow him some time at home.

Ronaldo returned to the Red Devils last summer. This followed his prolific spells at Real Madrid and Juventus. The 37-year-old has been criticised at times this season but his contribution in terms of goals cannot be disputed. Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters The forward has netted 23 goals from his 37 appearances across all competitions this term. This includes eight goals in his last five Premier League games. Last time out he earned United a point at Old Trafford against Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea. The Blues were by far the better side on the night but they did not make the most of their chances. Keane argued post-match that Ronaldo would score even more goals if he played for Chelsea: “I know people are quick to criticise what [Ronaldo] doesn’t do in terms of his pressing but he was never great at that anyway,” Keane said (quotes via Football London). “He is the greatest at what is the hardest part of the game, putting the ball in the back of the net. “You see the chances that Chelsea were creating. Imagine if he was in the Chelsea team, he’d probably get 50 goals. He’s in a poor Manchester United team who aren’t creating many chances for him and he’s producing.” Keane also stated that there was a problem with the “attitude” of Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku: After signing for £97.5m from Inter Milan in the summer transfer window, Lukaku was expected to hit the ground running at Chelsea but has managed just ten goals in 37 appearances in all competitions. And Keane didn’t like what he saw from the Chelsea striker on Thursday night with the Man Utd legend expecting Lukaku to attempt to prove a point against his former club. Keane said on Sky Sports: “He’s come on against Man United, he was [a player] here, so you think, ‘I’ll show them my qualities’. He came on and again, just ambling along, not that determination to get himself a goal. As much as his fitness levels, I think his attitude doesn’t seem right.” ",positive,manchester united,2

It was confirmed late last week that he would take over as Austria boss at the end of the season but remain at Old Trafford in a part-time role. There has always been an understanding that Rangnick would move into a consultancy position at Man Utd after his period as interim manager came to an end – but there was no expectation from fans that he would be doing another job at the same time. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong On becoming Austria boss, Rangnick said: “I will take over as national team manager of Austria at the end of the season but will continue my consultancy with Manchester United. “I’m really looking forward to playing my part in helping United become a real force again.” But Carragher thinks it is “a nonsense” that Man Utd think he will be able to fulfill his job at Old Trafford while also managing a national team. The former Liverpool defender said on Sky Sports: “Ralf Rangnick isn’t really a manager, he’s a director of football, he’s someone who helps the coaches or builds the club. “I’ll be honest with you I just don’t get that. I don’t think you can be manager of Austria and work for Manchester United. “He can work for Manchester United in that role…well that’s wrong. That should not be happening. “The manager of Austria should not be working part time for Manchester United. That’s just a nonsense! It’s one or the other.” 🗣 @Carra23: “That is WRONG.

Neville told Sky Sports: “The Austrian national team has pride, great country and some great players so he’ll have to watch players all week then he’s going to go and coach them for two weeks in September, October, November and March. So you’re saying to yourself what’s happening with the Manchester United consultancy advice? “Where is the priority? There’s a conflict there.” Neville added: “I don’t see that. I don’t see how that can work, you’re a national team manager and I’ve worked under a national team manager, that national team manager has got to present week in, week out, Saturday, Wednesday, Saturday, Tuesday and he can’t be here at Old Trafford every week watching an Austrian player play. “I can’t see how that’s going to work, if it’s something that’s true. Maybe (it’s a compromise) but it’s messy, Manchester United can’t afford at this moment to have distractions, can’t afford at this moment in time to have a poor communications plan around the idea that Ralf Rangnick’s our football consultant but he’s seen watching German football three times a month then going coaching the Austrian team two times a month. “That’s not going to work because people are going to say ‘hang on, who’s in the director’s box? What’s Darren Fletcher doing? What’s John Murtough doing? What’s Ralf Rangnick doing wherever he’s watching an Austrian player? “I don’t think they can afford that at this moment in time. Laser-focused, clear lines, people staying in their lines understanding what their roles are and actually communicating that to a fan base, this is a real change, this is different than it has been for the last 10 years.”  ",positive,manchester united,6

The report claims Rashford is ‘confident’ of refinding his form at Old Trafford and ‘can’t wait’ for a fresh start under Ten Hag as he looks to reclaim his place in Gareth Southgate’s England squad. A source said:“Both camps have spoken and Marcus is aware of what the new manager wants and expects. “This season has been difficult but he’s never wanted to leave Old Trafford. He’s optimistic about his chances under Ten Hag and knows that if he plays well for United, he will be in the thoughts of Gareth Southgate.” The report also states that Lingard is open to the idea of staying at United and will seek assurances from Ten Hag over his role going forward before making any decisions. It’s claimed Ten Hag is eager to have a conversation with the midfielder, who enjoyed a brilliant loan spell at West Ham last season and has been linked with a return to the London Stadium, while Newcastle are also said to be in the mix for the 29-year-old forward. Meanwhile, with the future of Cristiano Ronaldo at United up in the air, amid rumours of a return to Real Madrid, Gary Neville believes the Portuguese star has plenty to offer Ten Hag next season. “He has been a bright light in a poor season.

David Moyes’ side have enjoyed a good season so far, reaching the Europa League semi-final’s as well as being in contention to secure European football for next season via the league. Lowe standards can finally lift Preston supporters from their secure slumber They are now being urged to build on the success of the past two seasons by bringing in Manchester United attacker Jesse Lingard and Everton defender Michael Keane. Lingard spent the second-half of last season with the Hammers, and was in fine form for Moyes’ outfit. They tried to bring him back to the club last summer and again in January but United refused to allow him to leave. He is now set to depart in the summer as a free agent and could make to move back to the London Stadium. Former Hammers man Cottee has urged his old side to bring him back and also tipped Everton defender Michael Keane as possible option. Cottee said (quotes via Metro): “West Ham needs to sign players like [Jesse] Lingard, like Michael Keane. “Players like that, good English players, coming and buying into what David Moyes got going on and want to be a part of the squad and that good team spirit they’ve got there.” Cottee also criticised the club for not investing in the January transfer window, and urged them to bring in up to six new names in the summer. “I think first and foremost West Ham should have signed players in the January window. That would have helped what’s going on. “The main priority in terms of this summer transfer window is to sign a centre-forward. They’ve had two years without one. “Michail Antonio is a fabulous player. I love watching him play but he is a converted right-back who became a centre-forward. He’s not a natural centre-forward. “Then you look at the midfield. What do you do with players like [Andriy] Yarmolenko, Alex Král and [Nikola] Vlasic who’s been very disappointing this year? These players haven’t quite progressed as they should have done. “West Ham, without a doubt, probably needs five or six new players into the squad.

The Englishman progressed through the ranks at Man Utd. He has played 232 times for the Red Devils across all competitions. Lingard has fallen down the pecking order in recent seasons though. He had a fruitful loan spell at West Ham in 2020/21, scoring nine times from 16 games.

The 29-year-old has only started twice in the league as he has spent much of the campaign on the sidelines. Newcastle looked to sign him in January but the Red Devils pulled the plug on the deal. Lingard is out of contract in June so he will finally be free to move elsewhere. McCoist is of the belief that the midfielder would be a good fit for Newcastle: “I think it would be a great move for both parties,” McCoist argued (quotes via The Chronicle). “Jesse, please get out of there and start playing football, it’s what we want to see, it’s what you want to do, it’s what you need to do. “We saw your talent when you went down to West Ham, that’s what you’ve got to do – get back playing for yourself. A move to Newcastle, a team that are on the up and are going places, I really do think it makes sense.” Elsewhere, Paul Scholes thinks Lingard has been “treated pretty poorly” by Man Utd: “I think Jesse has been treated pretty poorly by the club, to be honest. “He was ready to sign for Newcastle at one point and West Ham, right at the end of deadline day and he was told he was going to get more minutes. “That clearly hasn’t happened. He’s deserved a chance. We all saw what he did at West Ham. He’s a really good footballer and can bring goals to a team and with this team playing so poorly as well, for him not to get a chance… I think he’s unfairly treated. “I think he might suit him [Ten Hag] and he might want to keep him. We will see what happens. “It’s obvious he never wants to leave Manchester United, and if this manager wants him then why wouldn’t he stay?” ",positive,manchester united,2

Lingard turned down offers in the summer to leave Old Trafford as he wanted to give himself a chance of earning a starting spot under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. However, neither Solskjaer nor his replacement Ralf Rangnick have given Lingard the game time he desired with the England international starting just four matches in all competitions this season. Garner heads ten-man queue ready to ‘save Man Utd millions’ His lack of time on the grass saw Lingard attempt to leave in January withNewcastle chief Amanda Staveley claiming the Man Utd winger “desperately wanted” to move to St James’ Park. Lingard, who is out of contract in the summer, had his move reportedly blocked by Man Utd with the 29-year-old advised to take a break in early February to clear his head. A report emerged late last month insisting that Man Utd ‘have no intention to open talks’ with Lingard over a new contract but Scholes thinks Ten Hag could attempt to keep him at the club. Scholes said on talkSPORT: “I think Jesse has been treated pretty poorly by the club, to be honest. “He was ready to sign for Newcastle at one point and West Ham, right at the end of deadline day and he was told he was going to get more minutes. “That clearly hasn’t happened.

And the Red Devils legend regrets talking about their private conversation. Scholes added: “I’ve had a little bit of stick for that.I don’t know why I did it! “Honestly, sometimes words just come out your mouth.

We should have scored more goals than we did,” he told BBC Sport. “We bounced back from a poor start and had numerous chances. We hit the crossbar and the post twice. We had enough chances to get a better result. “The one thing we didn’t do well was defending in and around our own box. This has been an issue all season. We should have defended better. The third goal was a clear offside and I do not understand why VAR did not intervene. “But in possession we created enough chances to get two or even three goals.” Before the game, Paul Scholes told DAZN that he “had a quick chat with Jesse [Lingard] the other day,” adding:“I’m sure he won’t mind me saying – the dressing room is just a disaster.”  When asked whether the dressing room really was “a disaster”, Rangnick replied: “I don’t know, you have to ask Jesse Lingard. “Obviously, after games like today, there is massive disappointment in the locker room. This is, for me, normal. “I think the whole group get on reasonably with each other, I’m not daring to say get on well, but I don’t see there is an issue with the atmosphere in the locker room. “They are very disappointed and frustrated. Had we converted the penalty it would have changed the whole game, but we didn’t. “We hit the post and had another VAR decision, we thought Cristiano’s goal was not offside. There were three unlucky VAR decision against us, there was also a handball decision inside the box. “But again we have to deal with it and cope with it. An improved performance but disappointing result “We need to defend better. We have conceded an average of three goals in our last three games, we were far better a few weeks ago. “There is a lot of work for sure. We knew that before the game. We showed what football we can play. Although we had to deal with the two early goals we still showed the attitude.

The stars in question are James-Ward-Prowse and Jarrod Bowen. The latter has been linked with Liverpool in recent months. Bowen has been one of West Ham’s standout players this term both domestically and in Europe. He has grabbed 16 goals and eleven assists from his 47 outings across all competitions. Who thinks the Manchester United Treble beats a Liverpool Quadruple? Ward-Prowse meanwhile progressed through the ranks at Southampton. He has played over 350 times for the Saints. He has also featured ten times for England since he made his debut in 2017. The free-kick specialist has impressed for Southampton this term. He has contributed nine goals and five assists in the Premier League. Spanish outlet Fichajes are reporting that Ward-Prowse and Bowen are ‘covered by Ten Hag for his Man Utd.’ Ward-Prowse is ‘one of the first names’ on the Dutchman’s ‘agenda’, while it is noted that Bowen has been one of the ‘main Premier League revelations’ in recent seasons. The report adds that Ten Hag is also an admirer of Feyenoord left-back Tyrell Malacia who is rated at around€15m. Elsewhere, Gary Neville has insisted that Ten Hag should be expected to win the Premier League title in the fourth year of his reign at Man Utd. The Dutchman was confirmed as the new permanent Red Devils boss last month with interim manager Ralf Rangnick making way at the end of the season. “I said four to five years to win a title and I don’t disagree with Jamie’s timeline of Champions League in the first two seasons while he’s sorting the recruitment out and getting used to the club. “Third season getting very close, I think to the point whereby the club have got confidence and won a trophy maybe. “And then that fourth year really is where they have to win a title, fifth year. That’s where I think really you’re looking at the moment realistically. “We all hope he comes in and blows everyone away and that Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola blow up somehow. “But they’re not blowing up are they? They’re achieving the same numbers of points year in year out so if their consistency remains, which there’s no reason to say it won’t then Ten Hag’s got a massive job to make up that points gap.” ",positive,manchester united,1

Three matches, at home to Brentford and away at Brighton and Crystal Palace, for fans and many of the players to go through the motions before being able to consign a miserable campaign to the history books and never speak of it again. But is there an opportunity here for United to get a head-start on the Erik ten Hag era? Here are five ways United can salvage something from what’s left of the season… 1) Draw a line under the past by using only the players who will be at United next season We don’t yet know exactly which players they may be. Gary Neville expects Ten Hag to oversee a “brutal transition” and there is no question that a great number will be shown the door this summer. We do know, though, that those out of contract at the end of the season won’t be sticking around. So what is to be gained by playing them now? Granted, of those players approaching free agency, only really Nemanja Matic has been involved regularly of late. Paul Pogba and Edinson Cavani will tell you they are injured; Juan Mata has had the odd cameo; Jesse Lingard had been a regular on the bench prior to being omitted from the squad to face Chelsea. Matic has been involved because of injuries to Scott McTominay and Fred, both of whom should be available for the Bank Holiday game against Brentford. With almost nothing to play for, it serves no-one other than Matic and his prospects of a decent move to play him in the remaining three games. Perhaps allow any number of him, Mata and Lingard a cameo at the end of the Brentford game to say farewell to the home supporters, assuming many of them stick around that long. Pogba and Cavani need not say goodbye given they have long since f***ed off. Man Utd quintet feature in Premier League XI of players ready for step down  2) Blood the youngsters Out with the old, in with the new – the ‘new’, in the short-term at least, being some of the youngsters to have come through United’s academy. Ralf Rangnick gave midfielder Hannibal Mejbri a few minutes at the end of United’s humiliation at Liverpool and forward Alejandro Garnacho had even less time off the bench when he was offered a senior debut in injury time against Chelsea. Now the interim boss has the chance to give each a proper chance to shine rather than just the gesture of a cameo. Similar goes for winger Shola Shoretire and left-back Alvaro Fernandez, who were also primed and ready to come off the bench against Chelsea. In three games against mid-table opposition, with little on the line for either side, rarely will United get the chance to see what these kids can do in a competitive-ish environment.  3) Try Ten Hag’s preferred system Reportedly, Ten Hag is already squirrelling away for United on the condition the Red Devils don’t bother him 48 hours before Ajax play. So it would not be an unreasonable request for Rangnick to dabble with the new manager’s preferred formation in the three games that are left. Ten Hag has predominantly used 4-3-3 at Ajax while also employing a 4-2-3-1, which also happens to be Rangnick’s formation of choice. Or, rather, it is the only shape he trusts these players to stick with since they’ve proven unable or unwilling to thrive in any other setup. We have to assume Rangnick has sounded out Ten Hag on what shape he might prefer to use from the start of his reign, and while whatever answer he offers will involve new players, there is no harm in seeing how the current crop might cope in a 4-3-3. If the squad is told it is Ten Hag’s choice rather than Rangnick, it might motivate some of them to open their minds and give it their best shot, which many haven’t done for the interim manager.   4) Give Marcus Rashford a break It is hard to fathom what else United can do with Rashford to reignite the spark in the forward. He played from the start against Chelsea and looked every bit as downtrodden as he has all season. If anything, his performances and body language are getting more worrying from United’s perspective. Rangnick could keep playing Rashford and hope that his fortunes turn around in one of the three games remaining, allowing the striker to end the season on a high. But it has already reached the point where it appears United are flogging a dead horse. And it is no surprise that Rashford is knackered. Every season as a senior pro has lasted until at least mid-June, with the forward featuring in a couple of European Championships, the 2018 World Cup, the Nations League finals and other England summer internationals. Last summer seemed to take the biggest toll, with a half-fit Rashford watching much of the Euros from the bench before missing a crucial penalty in the final shoot-out. He then underwent shoulder surgery, causing him to miss the start of the season and upon returning he has never looked quite the same, either for Rangnick or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Only he and his family know what else might be affecting him away from the pitch. Many reckon United and Rashford need a break from each other, which is probably true, only not a permanent arrangement as some suggest. But there is more to be gained for both parties by sending Rashford off on holiday now. Since he has lost his spot in the England squad, he has the opportunity to take May and June to get his body and head in the best possible place for Ten Hag’s arrival.  5) End Harry Maguire’s season as well Much of the above also applies to United’s skipper, too. Rangnick says Maguire is battling to play again this season owing to a knee injury, but it is a pointless fight. His form has been so poor lately that the last thing he or United need is for the defender to return prematurely and make things even worse. Maguire is under a mega-f***-tonne of pressure and is getting very little sympathy from United fans. They were aghast at the defender being jeered on England duty, forgetting that his substitution in the Champions League was cheered by many inside Old Trafford. Maguire is not one to back down or walk away, but he needs to pick his battles. With Gareth Southgate almost certain to call him up for England’s end-of-season fixtures, Maguire could use a holiday now to clear his head and get his knee right. Maybe swerve Greece, though, big man… ",negative,manchester united,1

After his spells at Real Madrid and Juventus, Ronaldo returned to the Red Devils last summer. A fee of around £13.5m plus add-ons was paid by Man Utd. The forward has been criticised by some this season but he has been one of few bright sparks for United. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong The 37-year-old scored his 24th goal of the season on Monday night as Man Utd beat Brentford 3-0 at Old Trafford. Carragher has often questioned United’s decision to re-sign Ronaldo and he did so again on Monday. He does not feel that they “should not be buying a 37-year-old”: “My problem has always been with Man United for buying Cristiano Ronaldo. One of the biggest clubs in the world should not be buying a 37-year-old,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “I’ve always been of the opinion that they should move him on, but right now, there are so many problems – ‘I need to get a midfielder, I need to get a centre-back.’ We’ve seen this season that when Ronaldo doesn’t play or gets brought off, it’s a massive story. “If you bring in strikers, are they to play or back up Ronaldo? If you’re the new manager, you might think you don’t need that on your plate. “They’ve got other problems. Would Liverpool ring back Luis Suarez? I don’t think so. United should be getting Erling Haaland. Man City are getting him. “It’s like United are a small club. It’s like when Rooney went back to Everton. It was just to lift the fans.” Carragher also thinks it’s “nonsense” that Ralf Rangnick will be managing Austria next season. The former Liverpool defender said on Sky Sports: “Ralf Rangnick isn’t really a manager, he’s a director of football, he’s someone who helps the coaches or builds the club. “I’ll be honest with you I just don’t get that. I don’t think you can be manager of Austria and work for Manchester United. “He can work for Manchester United in that role…well that’s wrong. That should not be happening. “The manager of Austria should not be working part time for Manchester United. That’s just a nonsense! It’s one or the other.” ",positive,manchester united,4

One candidate ruled out as tabloid obsession over Manchester United captaincy continues Erik ten Hag has been confirmed as the club’s new permanent boss ahead of this summer. Rangnick has only won ten of his 26 games in charge of Man Utd across all competitions. They exited the Champions League and they are five points adrift of the top four. It was announced on Friday that Rangnick will be Austria’s new manager. It is worth noting that he will continue working for Man Utd in a consultancy capacity. Jordan believes that “the whole outlook is wrong” at Man Utd currently: “I felt [Ralf] Rangnick would go into Manchester United and he would be a sea change, and have the courage of his convictions to be able to put his foot down,” Jordan told talkSPORT. “I think it is much more difficult than that, the entire culture at Manchester United is wrong. The fabric of the playing squad is wrong, they have bought the wrong players, and they are going to have to change it. “I think if you put Pep Guardiola in for six months, he would have struggled with the current crop of players. “The attitude and outlook of disposition of that football club from the owners, to the fans, the whole outlook is wrong. “The fans are not satisfied because of the Glazers and the performance of the team, but anybody could have done it for six months. “But why would he want to be a consultant? He is a person who makes decisions and wants to implement them. “The problem is that he wasn’t involved in the selection process of the manager – he obviously has not been as Erik ten Hag has not spoken to him. “As a consultant, he basically parachutes in and looks at other people’s work, and let others implement his decisions.” Jordan went onto suggest that Darren Fletcher and John Murtough should be “working a little bit lower down the food chain”: “Darren Fletcher is not fit for purpose in his role, and neither is John Murtough – you need to get the best in class. “I am sure they are very decent individuals, but perhaps they should be working a little bit lower down the food chain inside Manchester United, so the club can start to bridge the gap. “Not just on the pitch, but off it, because off it will influence what happens on it.” ",negative,manchester united,4

One candidate ruled out as tabloid obsession over Manchester United captaincy continues Reacting to the news that Rangnick was set to become the new Austria boss, Neville said: “Manchester United’s Sporting Director or consultant can he really be going looking at Austrian players, week in, week out? And then selecting them for the national team? “The Austrian national team has pride, great country and some great players so he’ll have to watch players all week then he’s going to go and coach them for two weeks in September, October, November and March. So you’re saying to yourself what’s happening with the Manchester United consultancy advice? “Where is the priority? There’s a conflict there.” The former Man Utd defender added: “I don’t see that. I don’t see how that can work, you’re a national team manager and I’ve worked under a national team manager, that national team manager has got to present week in, week out, Saturday, Wednesday, Saturday, Tuesday and he can’t be here at Old Trafford every week watching an Austrian player play. “I can’t see how that’s going to work, if it’s something that’s true. Maybe (it’s a compromise) but it’s messy, Manchester United can’t afford at this moment to have distractions, can’t afford at this moment in time to have a poor communications plan around the idea that Ralf Rangnick’s our football consultant but he’s seen watching German football three times a month then going coaching the Austrian team two times a month. “That’s not going to work because people are going to say ‘hang on, who’s in the director’s box? What’s Darren Fletcher doing? What’s John Murtough doing? What’s Ralf Rangnick doing wherever he’s watching an Austrian player? “I don’t think they can afford that at this moment in time.

Ronaldo scored the equaliser in a 1-1 draw against Chelsea on Thursday night to take his goal tally for the season to 23. When he was asked about Ronaldo’s future after the match, Rangnick replied: “This is something that we should speak about between Erik and the board and myself.

Rangnick said: “We have to still be fair with the players. We had quite a few other players scoring goals. “I remember, in my first 10 games, we had 10 different goalscorers.

After beating Chelsea and Manchester United, Arsenal travelled to face West Ham United on Sunday afternoon. Holding was handed a rare start and he headed the Gunners in front in the 38th minute. The score was 1-1 at the interval though as Jarrod Bowen scored. Everton top PL winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature Arsenal ran out winners in the end as Gabriel’s goal in the 55th minute earned them all three points. Tottenham defeated Leicester earlier in the day so Arteta’s side remain two points clear of their rivals. The battle for fourth is now just between the North London rivals. They face off at The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium next week. Holding has suggested that Arsenal “looked more like a team” after being told off by Arteta: “Yeah, we were a bit disappointed to concede that coming in just before half-time,” Holding told Arsenal Media. “It would have been nice to go in one-nil, but he gave us all a shouting and telling off and we came out and looked more like a team and played how he wanted to play.” On fans calling for him to be brought on off the bench in previous weeks, he added:“Yeah, the fans were calling to bring Rob Holding on, but he was already on! “It’s what it’s been like, Ben and Gabi have been great all year and when I’ve had to come on and try and help us secure the three points it’s vital for us, so to play the full 90 and get the three points is even better.” Elsewhere, Chris Sutton has criticised Arsenal for “celebrating like they’ve won the league” after their 2-1 victory over West Ham on Sunday. There were dramatic scenes in the away end for both goals and at full time as they celebrated a tight win at the London Stadium but Sutton didn’t like what he saw. “Arsenal celebrating like they’ve won the league… dear me.” ",positive,manchester united,1

Owen has called for Rangnick to give the club’s youngsters some game time against the Bees: “Now United have little to play for, I’m curious whether Ralf Rangnick will change the personnel,” (quotes via The Express). “There’s a lot of promising youngsters at the club, now would be an ideal opportunity for them to get some game time ahead of the new boss coming in this summer. “Brentford have had such a great season and can travel to Old Trafford full of confidence after that draw against Spurs. They’ve been very organised in recent weeks, and make it difficult for each side they face. “I’m still going to pick United. Brentford will be difficult to break down, I’m going for 1-0.” Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson has also made a prediction for Monday night’s clash at Old Trafford. The former Arsenal man thinks Man Utd and Brentford will draw 2-2. He believes this will be a “hard game” for the hosts: “Manchester United have more immediate concerns, however, and this’ll be a hard game for them,” Merson told Sportskeeda. “The way Brentford have been playing, they could pull this off. Who would’ve thought this was possible one, two, or ten years ago? “Brentford are going to go out there expecting to win this game.

The Lazio standout has been linked with a move to the Red Devils. They are understood to value him at€70m. Manchester United scout watches £100m target subbed at HT; Everton’s Richarlison hope The Serbia international has been with Lazio since 2017. He has consistently been their top performer both domestically and in Europe. The 27-year-old has played 291 times for the Serie A club. He has been capped 30 times by Serbia since making his debut in 2017. Former Chelsea player Mateja Kezman is Milinkovic-Savic’s agent. Foot01 have quoted him saying that they are ‘dealing with Manchester United and PSG’. It is also noted that the player ‘wants to go’ to United. Kezman has now suggested that these quotes were fabricated and that it is “fake news”: “It’s fake news. I have never given interviews in the last period, some journalists are really incredible,” Kezman said (quotes via MEN). “I’m very angry, it is a lack of respect towards me, towards Sergej and Lazio.” Elsewhere, Tony Cascarino has insisted that he “can see why Erik ten Hag may fancy” signing James Ward-Prowse when he arrives at Man Utd at the end of the season. Southampton midfielder Ward-Prowse, who has ten goals and seven assists in all competitions this season, is one player who has been linked with a move to Man Utd this week and former Chelsea striker Cascarino thinks he would be a good signing. “It was interesting to see James Ward-Prowse linked with a move to Manchester United,” Cascarino told The Times. “At 27, the Southampton midfielder is entering the peak years of his career and if he is not content with being a one-club man, now may be the time for a big move. “Ward-Prowse is so much more than simply a dead-ball expert (though there are few better than him from corners and free kicks).

The Red Devils suffered another blow to their chances of qualifying for the Champions League next season after they lost 1-0 to out-of-form Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday. Defeat against the Toffees means Man Utd are now six points behind fourth-placed Tottenham in the Premier League table with seven matches to go. ‘Laughable’ Liverpool exposed; Man Utd must shift quartet out To make matters worse, their last seven games of the season look extremely tricky to navigate, with Liverpool, Arsenal, Brighton and Crystal Palace to play away and Norwich, Brentford and Chelsea to face at Old Trafford. After watching Man City and Liverpool put on an amazing spectacle on Sunday, Neville tore into Man Utd after the weekend’s results. “I’ve got very few words left for Manchester United,” Neville said on his Sky Sports podcast. “No anger, no comment anymore. They are a bit of a farce; you almost expect it from them. The players are taking Ralf Rangnick down with them. They are bad. “When I look at Manchester City and Liverpool, they have humble football players; no over-inflated egos, they understand their position, the team comes first. “There isn’t one Manchester United player that would get into any of those two teams, so why would you have an over-inflated ego, think you didn’t have to work hard, or be spiritless? I don’t see anything anymore.” And Neville now thinks Rangnick’s reputation is now taking a hit with the Man Utd interim boss looking ‘weaker and vulnerable on the touchline’ in recent weeks. Neville added: “Ralf Rangnick came with an incredible reputation but he’s now starting to be wounded by what’s happening around him and he looks weaker and vulnerable on the touchline due to the performances of players on the pitch, who have nothing to do with him. “Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is a good man, the players liked him and yet they turned him over. It’s a real difficult position for the club to be at. “I feel like most Manchester United fans at this moment in time in that I don’t know where to turn next or what’s going to happen. “I’m living on the feeling that the club one day will return. The club will rise again but this is getting low, real low. But it will come back, and you look forward to that day. “Those Liverpool fans over my shoulder have been where Manchester United have been, they have been in those low moments when Manchester United were winning, when they maybe didn’t have a team they could be proud of. Maybe it’s time for those Manchester United players to have a look at themselves. “I do believe players want to do well, but what they are showing at this moment in time is nowhere near good enough.”  ",positive,manchester united,6

A product of the Red Devils’ famed academy system will see his contract expire in the summer, meaning that he will move on and sever ties with the club that gave him a big break and paved the way for international recognition with England to be enjoyed. Lingard will be walking away without taking in another appearance on home soil, with Ralf Rangnick opting to leave the 29-year-old midfielder as an unused substitute in a 3-0 Premier League victory over Brentford – United’s final outing in front of their own supporters in the 2021-22 campaign. Louie Scott has posted in a passionate message on Instagram: “20 years of blood, sweat and tears, 4 domestic trophies, 3 cup final goal, not even a farewell. No wonder it’s Conference League next year. “Attacking players for celebrations when the clubs being sold to the super league ok. Class of 92, Busby Babes, you’re ran by people who don’t even know the offside trap. Classless and the fans need to realise. Goodnight, godbless! “Been there since nine years of age and didn’t even get a send off!!! Well done bro your family are proud.” It appeared at one stage as though Lingard would leave Old Trafford before the current campaign got underway, having spent the second half of last season impressing on loan at West Ham. The Hammers were eager to do a permanent deal, while Newcastle expressed interest in January, but the Red Devils refused to sanction a sale and made a bit-part player in their plans see out his contract. He has taken in 22 appearances across all competitions for United this term, but only two of those have been Premier League starts. Alternative options have continued to be favoured despite struggles for consistency leaving the Red Devils without a top-four finish and qualification for the Champions League, with Europa League football in 2022-23 the best that they can hope for. Many have questioned why Lingard has been used so sparingly, and why exits were blocked off in the winter transfer window, with club legend Paul Scholes telling talkSPORT: “I think Jesse has been treated pretty poorly by the club, to be honest. He was ready to sign for Newcastle at one point and West Ham, right at the end of deadline day and he was told he was going to get more minutes. “That clearly hasn’t happened. He’s deserved a chance. We all saw what he did at West Ham. He’s a really good footballer and can bring goals to a team and with this team playing so poorly as well, for him not to get a chance… I think he’s unfairly treated.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

He has done his best to make that possible in the current campaign, after securing an emotional return to English football, but a 24-goal haul has failed to inspire a top-four finish or deliver major silverware. There have been rumours of a five-time Ballon d’Or mulling over a move elsewhere as the Red Devils struggle to replicate their success of the not too distant past, but Ronaldo has suggested that he is ready to form part of another rebuild under incoming manager Erik ten Hag. An all-time great signed a two-year contract when rejoining United from Juventus in the summer of 2021. He stated at that stage that he may be tempted to stay on beyond 2023, with his latest post on Instagram offering no indication that he is considering an imminent change of scenery. After finding the target from the penalty spot in a 3-0 victory over Brentford, Ronaldo said on social media: “Once again, great support from the stands. “Let’s take this opportunity of our last game of the season at Old Trafford to thank our amazing supporters, who endured a difficult season by our side and never abandoned us. “Thanks, guys. Your support means the world to us and our goal is to become better everyday, so that we can achieve what we all want: glory for Man. United!” United’s struggles for consistency in the Premier League this season have contributed significantly to the questions being asked of Ronaldo’s ongoing presence. He has graced a Champions League stage of some description in every single one of his senior campaigns to date, with that run stretching back to his early days at Sporting. As he is now 37 years of age and approaching the end of a remarkable career, Ronaldo would have been eager to remain at the highest level for as long as possible. A top-four finish is realistically now beyond United, as they could suffer their worst ever finish in the Premier League, but continental qualification remains on the agenda. The Red Devils sit sixth in the table at present and appear to be well on course to add Europa League football to their schedule for 2022-23. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Fernandes opened the scoring for the Red Devils as they beat Brentford 3-0 in their final home game of the campaign. United are expected to fall short of booking a place in the Champions League this season, as they sit five points behind fourth-place Arsenal with just two games left to play - the Gunners and fellow challengers Tottenham have two games in hand.

The Serbia international has been linked with the Red Devils for some time, with eye-catching performances in Italy hinting at a potential big-money transfer to the Premier League. It was claimed that former Chelsea striker Kezman, who now represents his fellow Serbian, was in discussions with Man Utd and Ligue 1 heavyweights Paris Saint-Germain over a summer switch with Old Trafford emerging as a favoured destination. It was reported by Foot01 that Kezman had said of the interest shown in Milinkovic-Savic: “Sergej has no shortage of offers for the summer market. “We are currently talking to Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain. He is focused on the season finale with Lazio, but Sergej wants to go to Manchester United.” The Red Devils are in the market for another combative midfielder, with West Ham star Declan Rice emerging as a top target. It may be that Milinkovic-Savic is another option being considered by a club preparing to welcome Dutch coach Erik ten Hag into their dugout at the end of the season, but rumours of formal discussions being held have been rubbished.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/premier-league-clubs-napoli-lazio-race-nice-wonderkid/blt7e0eece764ebe672,Premier League clubs join Napoli & Lazio in race for Nice wonderkid Flavius Daniliuc,"Nice youngster Flavius Daniliuc is attracting interest from a number of clubs ahead of the summer transfer window, GOAL has learned, with Premier League teams joining Napoli and Lazio in tracking the talented defender. Interest in the versatile 21-year-old is predicted to build as his stock continues to soar, with a scramble for his signature set to be sparked at some stage. For now he is continuing to further his development in France, but the expectation is that a player schooled in the academy systems at Real Madrid and Bayern Munich will step up onto a more prominent stage at some point in the not too distant future. An ambitious prospect, who turned out as a midfield playmaker while with Spanish giants Real, took the decision to walk away from Bayern in the summer of 2020. He had been captain of the U19 side in Bavaria and was held in high regard by the Bundesliga heavyweights. A call was made to head for France in order to find more first-team opportunities, with that decision being vindicated by a meteoric rise to prominence. His potential has now been noted by leading sides from across Europe, with the Vienna-born starlet seemingly ready to take on a new challenge as he is already fluent in English, Spanish, German and Romanian – the native language of his parents – while also learning French. Daniliuc has already skippered Austria’s U21 team and is seemingly set to push for senior international recognition when current Manchester United manager Ralf Rangnick takes the reins of that squad over the summer. The likes of Napoli, Lazio and impressed parties from England are mulling over moves for Daniliuc as he has slotted seamlessly into the fold at Nice. He moved to France in order to work under World Cup winner Patrick Vieira and took in 25 appearances across his debut season – breaking through 50 outings for the club in the current campaign. 5️⃣0️⃣th Nice appearance for Flavius Daniliuc 🔴⚫️The 🇦🇹 youth international will start at right back against @girondins #OGCNice #FCGBOGCN pic.twitter.com/TututsJvb9 Christophe Galtier, who led Lille to the Ligue 1 title in 2020-21, has continued to bring the best out of Daniliuc when using him on the right of a four-man defensive unit. A highly-rated performer is, however, just as comfortable when figuring as a centre-half and appears to be treading a similar path to fellow countryman David Alaba – who left Bayern for Real Madrid in 2021. He has caught the eye when lining up against some of the very best in the business, keeping Neymar very quiet during a meeting with Paris Saint-Germain last season, and is currently readying himself for a shot at major silverware on May 7 when Nice will face Nantes in the Coupe de France final.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/johan-bakayoko-psv-teenage-star-thriving-van-nistelrooy/blt79419761189d2222,Johan Bakayoko: PSV's teenage star thriving under Van Nistelrooy,"One of the finest strikers of the 2000s, Ruud van Nistelrooy has had to wait for his chance to step into first-team management. The ex-Manchester United and Real Madrid forward has had two spells as part of the coaching staff for the Netherlands national side, while also working within the youth structure at PSV. But this summer, Van Nistelrooy will make the step up to take charge of the senior side in Eindhoven, replacing the outgoing Roger Schmidt after a season in charge of Jong PSV in the second tier of Dutch football. Given his playing career, the 45-year-old will be expected to particularly oversee improvements in attack, though there is a chance he will first have to rebuild his forward line. Cody Gakpo is expected to move on, with a host of Europe's biggest clubs - including Arsenal, Liverpool and Bayern Munich - having been linked with the 22-year-old winger. At the start of the season, the same thing was expected for Noni Madueke, but injuries have hampered the England youth international in 2021-22, meaning the Premier League and Bundesliga clubs that are keen on the forward may well decide to look elsewhere, at least for now. Regardless, Van Nistelrooy is going to require reinforcements, one of which could be the teenager that has lit up his own side this term. With just a single game of Jong PSV's season to play, Johan Bakayoko can already boast a record of 17 goals and 11 assists for the team in 2021-22, meaning he has been directly involved in a goal every 85.4 minutes in the second division. Madueke, is that you? 🧐De 18-jarige Johan Bakayoko steelt de show bij Jong PSV tegen Almere City: twee assists en een goal ✨#JPSALM pic.twitter.com/G5Cj5p0psn Given he only managed a solitary strike and three assists in 19 appearances at that level last season, that is quite some improvement from the Belgium youth international, and one which Van Nistelrooy has played a key role in. ""You can see that he has power and also a good shot,"" Van Nistelrooy told ESPN in January. ""He plays such controlled football that you forget that he is only 18. ""If he continues to invest so much in what he does, he is a boy who is on the right track to join the first team at the end of the season."" Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: That step has not quite materialised, however, with the 19-year-old having made just two appearances off the bench for PSV's senior side thus far, but that is likely to change once Van Nistelrooy takes the reins. PSV certainly envisaged him becoming a first-team player when they tempted him to join the club from Anderlecht in 2019, with Bakayoko having previously spent time at Club Brugge and Mechelen. His first two seasons with the club, though, suggested that he may be some distance off that level, and that following Madueke's path of starring for the youth sides before making an impact on the Eredivisie was unlikely. The club, though, saw things differently, and in the summer of 2021 offered the teenager a new four-year contract, which Bakayoko signed while donned in a white suit and red bowtie. ""Now it's up to me to prove that I can put up the numbers required of me,"" he said at the time. ""I want to be more decisive in terms of my stats, and I've been talking to the coaches about doing that."" He has been a man of his word, honing his finishing ability under Van Nistelrooy's watchful eye, though he is much more than a player who puts the ball in the net. Naturally left-footed, he generally plays from the right-hand side, using his speed and close control to cause nightmares for opposing full-backs before cutting inside to either score or create chances for his team-mates. With six, he has the most goals from outside the penalty area in the Dutch second tier, with his decision making in terms of when to try his luck and when to look for help much improved from previous years. ""At the beginning of 2021, Johan was not doing well,"" his agent, Gerard Witters, told Het Nieuwsblad. ""But after he got his new contract, everything changed. ""He started to boost his stats and his recent games were phenomenal. The club has told me that Johan is already better than they initially thought he would be. ""Before he sometimes played like a crazy dog. He had great qualities and was very explosive, but he produced poor crosses and took shots when they were not the best option. ""Now he knows a lot more what he's going to do and defenders can't stop him anymore, despite the fact that he always does the same movement (cutting inside).” Bakayoko's form has been particularly good since the season's winter break, with his confidence spiking after he netted four times against VVV-Venlo in January. More recently, he came off the bench for the final 33 minutes against FC Eindhoven and scored twice before assisting PSV's third goal in a game that looked to be heading for a draw until the youngster's introduction. Now the challenge becomes replicating those performances against the best teams in the land, with PSV hopeful of yet again challenging Ajax for the title after their back-and-forth race this season. His history with Van Nistelrooy should certainly help in that respect, and if the legendary striker is to succeed as a coach, then he will hope that he can soon rely on his young charge to lead the way.

The 28-year-old Black Star picked up an injury during Arsenal’s 3-0 defeat against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park Stadium on April 4 and he has gone ahead to miss five Premier League matches.  He missed the 2-1 defeat against Brighton & Hove Albion at the Emirates Stadium, the 1-0 away defeat against Southampton, the 4-2 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, the 3-1 victory against Manchester United at home, and the 2-1 away win against West Ham United.  In his absence, Arsenal have relied on Egypt international Mohamed Elneny, who has started in the last three matches where the Gunners have registered wins. While Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has ruled out the player for the rest of the season, it seems Partey is not giving up yet.  On Monday, Arsenal’s official Twitter handle posted a video of defender Gabriel Magalhaes diving to head home a cross from Gabriel Martinelli for the winning goal against West Ham at London Stadium and Partey responded. 🇧🇷 Gabi x Gabi 🇧🇷#WHUARS pic.twitter.com/pq690RT5Cn “Tom X Tom [Takehiro Tomiyasu] soon.”  His statement was also in response to defender Takehiro Tomiyasu, who returned from injury in the game against West Ham, and an indication he will play with him before the season ends.  Ahead of Arsenal’s trip to face West Ham, Arteta admitted the absence of Partey was affecting his plans for the team.  “The stats are there and they are unquestionable,” Arteta told Daily Mail. “The win rate when Thomas is there is higher. It is something that is not good for us because in the last two seasons he has not been there as much as we want.  “We need him to play in that role on his own, with the quality he brings and the experience that he brings. And the fact he brings things that are unique that we want.  “Then we can accommodate players in other positions that for them are more relevant and can determine games in the way that we can. “Otherwise we have to consider and improve with the players we have by using them in a different way, changing formation, and finding ways to compensate.”  Arsenal, who are sitting fourth on the 20-team table with 63 points from 34 matches, will face Leeds United at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.

GOAL takes a look at the hopefuls longing to see their names called. Jordan Pickford.That's all. pic.twitter.com/BKSqEuwXWg Everton keeper Jordan Pickford has been Southgate’s go-to option between the sticks, as he blends shot-stopping ability with impressive distribution off the deck, and appears guaranteed to make the cut if fit. The same could be said for Aaron Ramsdale following his eye-catching campaign at Arsenal, with the 23-year-old another of those that is as comfortable with his feet as he is with his hands. Burnley’s Nick Pope has often been third in line for England and will hope to see that trend continue when some big calls are made ahead of a showpiece event in November. Sam Johnstone is playing Championship football at West Brom this season, but remains in contention, while Jack Butland could surge up the pecking order if a starting berth is retained at Crystal Palace. Etienne Green has been making quite a name for himself at Saint-Etienne in France but he, along with fellow England U21 international Josef Bursik of Stoke, remains one for the future. Alex McCarthy and Fraser Forster have been in and around senior squads before, but would need untimely setbacks to be endured by others in order to see a path clear for them.

𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗹 𝗼𝗻𝗲.England right-back edition 💫 pic.twitter.com/nAwhrBkm8H There are a number of spots in Southgate’s defensive unit that appear to have been filled, with eight players currently odds-on to make England’s final 23-man party. Harry Maguire of Manchester United, Manchester City centre-half John Stones, United and Chelsea left-backs Luke Shaw and Ben Chilwell and the versatile Ben White of Arsenal are all expected to get the nod. There is far greater competition at right-back, with Kyle Walker of Manchester City, Liverpool star Trent Alexander-Arnold, Chelsea full-back Reece James and Newcastle new boy Kieran Trippier all competing for one starting berth. Outside of the established elite, Tyrone Mings’ value as a left-footed centre-half could see the Aston Villa man called upon. Conor Coady of Wolves, AC Milan centre-half Fikayo Tomori and Eric Dier and Joe Gomez of Tottenham and Liverpool respectively could figure if fortune favours them. Tariq Lamptey has caught the eye at Brighton, but faces fierce competition in his favoured defensive berth. Recognition may well come for the likes of Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi or Chelsea's Trevoh Chalobah as they continue their development.

Great performance! ❤️ pic.twitter.com/Ea10Hb4P9H There are another eight apparently obvious selections when it comes to midfield berths, with West Ham holding star Declan Rice, talented teenager Jude Bellingham of Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea playmaker Mason Mount and Manchester City youngster Phil Foden the shortest-priced of those. Jack Grealish, as the most expensive player in British football at Manchester City, is another almost guaranteed to secure a ticket, along with Bukayo Saka of Arsenal and Leeds United talisman Kalvin Phillips. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson will hope to have done enough to earn a call from Southgate, while Arsenal starlet Emile Smith Rowe has emerged as another useful creative influence. Conor Gallagher’s impressive loan spell at Crystal Palace has brought him into contention, while Jesse Lingard cannot be ruled out entirely despite struggling for minutes at Manchester United as he will drop into the free agent pool this summer and land himself a move elsewhere. James Maddison may be a key man at Leicester, but other playmakers are ahead of him on England’s depth chart, while the same can be said for Liverpool midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain – a man with 35 caps to his name. Dele Alli will need to produce something special during a loan spell at relegation-threatened Everton to work his way back into favour, while home-grown Chelsea star Ruben Loftus-Cheek is another to have fallen out of favour since figuring in England’s run to the last four at the 2018 World Cup.

He will be involved, though, if untimely injuries are avoided, as will Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling and Manchester United star Marcus Rashford. Jadon Sancho has come back into form at Manchester United, giving him a shot at selection, while Dominic Calvert-Lewin will be hoping to do enough at Everton to prove that he can provide capable cover for Kane. Manchester United's Marcus Rashford remains highly regarded and is expected to make the plane, but his odds of inclusion may take a tumble if the dip in form, which saw him left out of England's March international panel, continues. Jarrod Bowen’s fine form at West Ham has made him flavour of the month, but he will need to maintain his current standards in order to secure a ticket to Qatar. Tammy Abraham has fared admirably in Italy with Roma, while Ollie Watkins remains a handful at Aston Villa, and they could be asked to provide back-up in a No.9 post. Callum Hudson-Odoi needs to be figuring more frequently for Chelsea in order to put himself into contention, Patrick Bamford and Callum Wilson have to shake off injury struggles at Leeds and Newcastle respectively, and Danny Ings must raise his game with Aston Villa in order to add to his three caps. There is little chance of Leicester’s Jamie Vardy being asked to step out of international retirement, but an attacking star may burst onto the scene out of nowhere and stage a late surge for selection within Southgate’s goalscoring ranks.

United snapped Ibrahimovic up on a free transfer following his departure from Paris Saint-Germain in 2016, and he enjoyed a fruitful debut campaign at Old Trafford, scoring 28 goals across 46 appearances. The Swede's impressive form in the final third helped the Red Devils secure a Europa League and League Cup double, and although his second campaign was blighted by injury, he still looks back on his experience in English football fondly. The 40-year-old, who is now taking in a second spell at Milan, believes he also managed to silence a fair few doubters by proving that he could deliver in the Premier League. ""I had fun,"" Ibrahimovic told ESPN when quizzed on his United career. ""I really enjoyed because when I came, everybody was against it. And then in England, they didn't like me. ""All these haters, after three months, they started to like me, I didn't like them anymore. ""I like people when they hate you because then they bring out the better of you. I had fun. [It] is a great competition, [an] amazing atmosphere. ""And I'm happy I played for United, which I think is the best team in England. And I think it was the right choice to go to Manchester United. ""I think I came in a good moment. Because it's easy to come to a club when the success is already there. It's more difficult when you come and the challenge is different. ""And then if you manage to have a success, you're part of the story. So the fans were great to me. And I really enjoyed [it]. A lot of things happened."" 🗣 Zlatan Ibrahimovic to l’Equipe: “Normally, at 40, you're at home, you light up a cigar and you're satisfied with the career you've had. “I’m not ready to smoke a cigar yet.” pic.twitter.com/GfHoip3FbZ Ibrahimovic eventually left Old Trafford in March 2018 before joining the LA Galaxy, and spent two years in MLS soccer before returning to Europe. Milan brought the Sweden international back to the club in January 2020 and he has since scored 33 Serie A goals, including eight in the current campaign. Ibrahimovic has played a key role in transforming the Rossoneri back into title contenders, but even if the 2021-22 season ends in Scudetto glory, he is not planning to walk off into the sunset. ""I want to play as long as I can,"" he told UEFA in March. ""The reality is I'll play until I see that someone is better than me, so I'm still playing.""

Greenwood has been out of the squad since January after the 20-year-old was arrested on suspicion of rape, assault and threats to kill. With Greenwood out of the team, Man Utd have relied mostly on 37-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo, with veteran Edinson Cavani and out-of-form Marcus Rashford struggling to provide the goals needed to ease the load on the Portuguese star's shoulders. ""We need at least two to give team more quality,"" Rangnick said. ""Modern strikers. ""Liverpool and Man City have five or six. Is Grealish a winger or striker? They are all strikers. ""We don’t have many. Mason Greenwood would have been but after West Ham he wasn't part of the squad."" Ronaldo has remained ever-present for the club, solidifying his spot as the team's top scorer with 24 goals in all competitions. Bruno Fernandes is second, having hit double-digits in the win over Brentford on Monday, with Greenwood still Man Utd's third-leading scorer this season despite being suspended for the second half of the season. Rashford sits fourth this season with five goals, level with winger Jadon Sancho. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The Red Devils beat Brentford 3-0 on Monday in Rangnick's final home game as interim manager, with the German set to step into a consultancy role at Old Trafford next term. The 63-year-old is confident that United can improve quickly as they near the end of a disappointing campaign that will see them miss out on silverware and a place in next season's Champions League. Rangnick told Sky Sports: ""It's obvious quite a few players will leave and there is a need for top-quality players. ""I strongly believe that if everyone works together we can bring Man Utd back to where we need to be. ""Other clubs only needed two or three transfer windows to challenge but from now on we need to bring in top-quality players who really help raise the level. ""If this happens then I don't think it should take too long."" Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic were two such players who will leave the club when their contracts expire at the end of the season. Mata, who has been with the club since 2014, put in a fine display in his final match at Old Trafford and the coach was pleased with the quality the pair added to the midfield. ""We played with Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic and that gave us some quality in midfield,"" Rangnick said. ""It was not too easy for Brentford to take the ball away from us. In the first half we played too many square and back passes but in general it was a good performance."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

We have had a lot of discussions internally and know what has to happen. “We need to be smart and decisive in our actions around the club, and we have started the process by making a very exciting managerial appointment with Erik ten Hag. When he arrives from Ajax next month, he joins a fantastic institution with great pedigree and, most importantly, great potential.""

Lingard returned to United in June after a successful six-month loan spell at West Ham, where he scored nine goals in 16 Premier League games to help David Moyes' side qualify for the Europa League. Moyes openly admitted that the Hammers were eager to sign the 28-year-old on a permanent deal, but they failed to do so before the summer deadline, and his assistant has suggested that the midfielder made the wrong choice over his future. Pearce believes Lingard could end up making a U-turn when the transfer market reopens due to the fact his considerable talents are being wasted at Old Trafford. ""He's missed the opportunity to leave United in this transfer window,"" the West Ham coach has told talkSPORT. ""He can reassess his situation come January once again and decide whether there’s an opportunity to move clubs. He holds the cards, Jesse. ""The most important thing for him at the moment is his football. He's playing the odd game for United and also playing extremely well for England - and those performances for England might help him get in the United side. ""I think he’s too good a player to be sat on the outside of it not playing and he’s at an age where he needs to be playing."" Lingard has featuredin 211 games across all competitions for United since making his debut back in 2011, scoring 33 goals while also setting up another 20 for his team-mates. However, the England international's sole appearance for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side so far this term came from the bench, and he currently finds himself behind the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Paul Pogba and Fred in the midfield pecking order. Lingard was selected for Gareth Southgate's latest Three Lions squad despite a lack of regular minutes at club level, and scored twice in a 4-0 World Cup qualifying win over Andorra at the weekend to send a statement ahead of his return to Old Trafford. He will hope to earn a place in Solskjaer's lineup for a home fixture against Newcastle on Sunday, but if he continues to play a bit-part role, West Ham could emerge as an attractive option again, particularly given the fact he is now less than 10 months away from the expiration of his contract.

The pair were among the Magpies' top transfer targets in the January window, but both ended up staying at their respective clubs. Despite Newcastle's failure to land them, Staveley said the players were eager to make the switch. She told The Athletic: ""We were 19th going into the window. So we had that, an illiquid market, and the complexity of Covid-19, which meant clubs didn’t want to sell because they didn’t know where their squads would end up. ""We had to encourage players – ‘we’ll be a safe place for you, we’ll deliver and grow’. Some desperately wanted to come to us, like Sven [Botman], who still does very much and has talked very openly about that. ""Coming through all that showed us we can do it, that we can stick to our plan and if we get criticised on the last day for: ‘Oh, you’re going after Jesse [Lingard]’, well, Jesse wanted to come to us. ""We did everything. We never stopped. From the start to the finish, we did not stop working."" While Eddie Howe's team missed out on two top targets, they did sign Bruno Guimaraes from Lyon, Chris Wood from Burnley, Kieran Trippier from Atletico Madrid and Brighton's Dan Burn. They also brought in Matt Targett on loan from Aston Villa for the rest of the season. Newcastle are currently 17th in the Premier League table and two points above the relegation zone. They are looking to boost their hopes of survival on Saturday when they take on Brentford away. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

No deal was done in the last window, despite West Ham being interested in landing their former loanee on a permanent basis, and the talented 28-year-old now faces fierce competition for places in the Red Devils' ranks. He has been getting opportunities this season, with a match-winning effort against the Hammers last time out coming on the back of a costly Champions League mistake in defeat to Young Boys, but Neville believes a creative playmaker is deserving of a more regular role somewhere. Nevilletold Sky Sports: ""I still maintain he should've left but he will have his moments. I was happy to see how he bounced back after what happened in Europe in midweek. ""To bounce back and score the winner is a fantastic moment for him. He's got good character, he's a very good player and I feel he should be playing 40-45 games a season. ""He won't get that at United in terms of 90-minute starts but he's one of those players that I do feel United will benefit from having. I just thought for Jesse himself, he should've left. United could be a better team with someone like Lingard in it."" Lingard appears to have no regrets at passing up another opportunity to head through the exits, with his sights locked on bringing a five-year wait for major silverware to a close in 2021-22. With his late strike against West Ham seeing United to a 2-1 victory and 13 points from five Premier League games, Lingard told MUTV of ambition on the red half of Manchester: ""You’ve got to always start well and make a statement to the rest of the teams and that’s what we’ve been doing. ""The main aim is to obviously win a trophy this season and I think we’ve got the squad depth to do that. The talent, everyone’s hungry to play and everyone’s working hard in training to get in that matchday squad. ""Everyone’s always ready to play, so the subs have got to be ready to make a difference. ""They’re always tough games against West Ham and to play them back to back is a little bit different, but we’ll go into that game full of confidence."" He added on his muted celebration against the Hammers, who helped to get his career back on track last season: ""They supported me in the loan spell and gave me a great reception, so it was only right to pay them back.""  While Lingard's goal proved to be the difference at the London Stadium, there were many more twists to an intriguing plot. West Ham had taken the lead on home soil through Said Benrahma, only to see the evergreen Cristiano Ronaldo peg them back. Lingard's telling contribution came in the 89th minute, but there was still time after that for Luke Shaw to concede a penalty, Mark Noble to be introduced off the bench to take a spot-kick and David de Gea to save it as a thrilling contest was closed out. On seeing the Spain international goalkeeper save his first penalty in 41 attempts, Lingard said: ""David’s always been a great penalty stopper and we had confidence in him and we trusted him to make the save, which he did. ""There’s been a real togetherness and everyone’s playing for each other; we’re playing to win games and playing for our fans and staff, so everyone’s ready to play."" United will be back in action on Wednesday when facing West Ham again in the third round of the Carabao Cup. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

In a match that was vital to the club's hopes of securing Champions League football for next season, Man Utd came undone as they fell 3-1 to Arsenal, another contender in the hunt for a top-four place. With the loss, Man Utd have lost three of their last four Premier League matches, with Scholes revealing that the atmosphere around the club has deteriorated. ""It's an absolute mess. It's a disaster of a dressing room,"" Scholes said on DAZN. ""I had a quick chat with Jesse the other day. I'm sure he won't mind me saying: that dressing room is a disaster."" It's been a difficult year at Old Trafford, with neither Ole Gunnar Solskhaer nor Ralf Rangnick able to steer the club in the right direction.

David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have all failed to rekindle former glories, while Ralf Rangnick is now preparing to pass a managerial baton to Erik ten Hag in the summer of 2022. Champions League football is unlikely to be agenda for the incoming Dutch coach, with another backwards step being taken on the field at Old Trafford, but are the Red Devils heading towards their worst finish in the modern era? GOAL takes a look… Manchester United's worst Premier League campaign came in 2013-14 – in the immediate aftermath of Ferguson’s departure. The Red Devils finished that season, which saw Moyes dismissed in the April after just 10 months at the helm, in seventh spot and with just 64 points to their name. They suffered 12 defeats through 38 games – another unwanted record in the Premier League era – and collected 19 wins. Rank Season Points Position 1 2013-14 64 7th =2 2015-16 66 5th =2 2018-19 66 6th =2 2019-20 66 3rd United would finish inside the top four just once across the following three seasons, with point tallies in the 60s becoming an alarmingly common theme. Since that rather disastrous showing under Moyes, with Ryan Giggs taking charge on an interim basis in the wake of his departure, the Red Devils have finished with 66 points on three occasions. David Moyes' six-year contract at Manchester United would have ended today... 📝The worst Premier League appointment ever?! 🤦‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/pXSIA0ysXr That return was only good enough for a fifth-placed standing under Van Gaal in 2015-16, although he did deliver FA Cup glory, while a further step backwards into sixth was taken in 2018-19 as Mourinho stumbled out of the blocks and Solskjaer wobbled on the back of an initial honeymoon period. Champions League qualification was secured with 66 points in 2019-20, as a Norwegian Treble winner saw his side into third spot, and United can do no better than hit that mark again in the present. With four games remaining in their 2021-22 campaign – against Chelsea, Brentford, Brighton and Crystal Palace – Rangnick’s men sit sixth on 54 points with 12 left to play for, meaning that they may yet post a new club-record low. Rank Season Points Position 1 1993-94 92 1st 2 1999-00 91 1st 3 2008-09 90 1st =4 2006-07 89 1st =4 2011-12 89 2nd =4 2012-13 89 1st While United have found the going tough of late, they have plenty of happy memories to fall back on. Their best showing to date came in the second year of the Premier League in 1993-94, with back-to-back title triumphs wrapped up as an Eric Cantona-inspired side collected 92 points while also going on to lift the FA Cup as part of a memorable double. A year on from going one better in completing a historic Treble, the Red Devils cemented their standing as top dogs in English football by accumulating 91 points in 1999-2000, with a club-record 28 victories collected along the way while also suffering just three defeats and plundering 97 goals. Ferguson’s men broke back into the 90s a decade later, in 2008-09, and saw their defence breached just 24 times that season as they also savoured League Cup glory. Three other campaigns, including Ferguson’s farewell tour, delivered 89-point hauls, with a final tally of 75 – on two occasions – as low as an all-time coaching great sunk in the wake of a rebranding of the English top-flight in 1992.

Questions have been asked of whether a five-time Ballon d’Or winner is starting to see his powers wane at 37 years of age, with his presence – along with 23 goals – unable to inspire an inconsistent Red Devils side to a top-four finish or major silverware in 2021-22. There have been suggestions that he could move on in the summer, but Foster sees no sign of a legendary figure slowing down and believes a standing as the greatest ever will be enhanced further as he plays on for “another year or two at least”. Foster, who is currently on the books at Watford, once played alongside Ronaldo at Old Trafford and believes his record-setting career places him slightly ahead of Argentine icon Messi in the GOAT stakes, telling The Mirror: “The level is high as you like. For a 37-year-old, he is an absolute specimen. He is still rapid. He is just one of those who is a natural goalscorer. “For me, in that eternal Messi v Ronaldo debate, he is still number one for me. “I think even this season people are completely mad that they think he is finished. He's not finished. Look how many goals he has scored, that's incredible. “For anybody, that is a fantastic season, but because it is Ronaldo, people expect 30, 40, 50 goals. No - he is playing in a team that is not firing on all cylinders so you are not going to score that many goals anyway, but for people to say that he is finished, no chance mate. “He is good to go still for another year or two at least.” Cristiano Ronaldo is the first player to score 100 league goals in La Liga and the Premier League 🐐 pic.twitter.com/mOddMcsk6n Ronaldo signed a two-year contract with United when making an emotional return to English football in the summer of 2021. There are still 12 months left to run on that agreement, but there has been talk of a veteran frontman taking his considerable skill set elsewhere for 2022-23. A retracing of steps to Real Madrid has been speculated on for a man that previously broke countless records in the Spanish capital, while there has been plenty of discussion regarding a fresh start in MLS. Ronaldo has offered no indication that he is readying himself for a new challenge, but a lack of Champions League football with the Red Devils may see his head turned.

A Portuguese superstar at Old Trafford has faced questions of his value to a collective cause in 2021-22, but has still plundered 23 goals to keep an inconsistent outfit in the hunt for European qualification. There have been suggestions that he will walk away from the final year of a lucrative contract once the current campaign comes to a close, but interim boss Rangnick – who will be sticking around as a consultant while also taking the reins of the Austria national team – is reluctant to be drawn on whether a five-time Ballon d’Or winner will still be a United player in 2022-23. When that question was put to Rangnick by Sky Sports ahead of a Premier League clash with Brentford, the German tactician said: “This is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag. “He's showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it's obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, it's pretty obvious.” Cristiano Ronaldo has scored eight of Manchester United’s last nine goals in the Premier League 🇵🇹 pic.twitter.com/SIg3HZulUk Rangick is yet to discuss Ronaldo with Ten Hag, with no talks of any kind having taken place between United’s head coaches of the present and future. Quizzed on whether he has spoken with a man seeing out the current campaign at Eredivisie title hopefuls Ajax, Rangnick said: “I'm pretty sure he's got my phone number! “He's got another couple of games to play with Ajax, we have another three games to play here. Whenever he wants to speak with me and exchange our opinions, I'm more than happy to do that.” Transfer plans need to be drawn up by United at some stage over the coming weeks, with it important that they do not leave themselves playing catch-up when another window swings open. Investment over recent years has delivered little return, as the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City have shown how it should be done, but Rangnick believes the gap to arch-rivals can be closed sooner than many people think. He has said of recruitment by the Red Devils: “If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window. “They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. “I wouldn't be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks. This shows it is possible that this can happen and it would not necessarily need three, four years in order to do that.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/watch-garnacho-man-utd-senior-debut-stunning-chipped-goal/blte26996407aacd48b,Watch: Garnacho follows up Man Utd senior debut with stunning chipped goal in U23s clash with Liverpool,"Alejandro Garnacho continues to show why he is held in such high regard by Manchester United, with the 17-year-old following up a senior debut for the Red Devils with an impressive chipped goal for the club’s U23 side in a meeting with Liverpool. The talented teenager, who has already broken into the full Argentina squad, made his Premier League bow off the bench in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Old Trafford – as he came on to partner Cristiano Ronaldo in attack during the close stages of that game. His intention is to see many more minutes over the coming years, as Erik ten Hag prepares to inherit first-team reins from Ralf Rangnick, but for now his focus is locked on catching the eye at youth level – with a prominent role played for United’s U18 side this season in their run to the FA Youth Cup final. Having stepped back down from the senior fold for now, Garnacho was among the goals on Sunday during a clash with Liverpool. Alejandro Garnacho's goal against Liverpool U23s pic.twitter.com/wC1qLy7LLl He figured against the Reds as part of a side that also included Alvaro Fernandez and Hannibal Mejbri, with United continuing to see highly-rated talent drop off a fabled conveyor belt. Garnacho’s strike against Liverpool further highlighted why he is held in such high regard, as he raced through on goal to finish with aplomb. The Red Devils would go on to lose the game 3-1, but that is all part of a steep learning curve for a Madrid-born youngster that is now rubbing shoulders with Ronaldo and Lionel Messi with club and country. Garnacho is understandably delighted at enjoying a breakthrough campaign in 2021-22 and has posted on social media: “Incredible moment making my debut at 17 years old for Manchester United in the Premier League at the Theatre of Dreams. “I can’t put into words what I’m feeling right now, I’ve been dreaming of this moment since I was 4 years old. “I would like to thank everyone at the club for giving me this opportunity, my family for always being there for me, my friends and all the fans for their constant support. The hard work continues in order to have more nights like these. And remember guys, Dreams really do come true.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/milinkovic-savic-man-utd-links-were-just-paper-talk-but/1dflbnxa3pjvd1flnl9tw43557,Milinkovic-Savic: Man Utd links were just paper talk but there’s still time for future transfer,"Sergej Milinkovic-Savic was once again linked with a move to Manchester United over the summer, but the Lazio midfielder claims such speculation was merely “paper talk”. Transfer talk has surrounded the Serbia international for some time, with his reputation having been enhanced during a productive spell in the Italian capital. At just 24 years of age, there is considered to still be plenty of potential to be unlocked in his game. United are reported to have expressed an interest in buying into that development, with a big-money move to Old Trafford being mooted. Another Premier League window has, however, swung shut with no deal done and Milinkovic-Savic insists he never considered a switch to be on the cards. He told Sport Plus: “You’ll never hear me say that I want to leave Lazio. “I never mentioned a possible transfer to Manchester United, it was just a newspaper story. “The situation doesn’t weigh on me because I know there’s still time for a possible transfer. “If something has to happen, it will. There hasn’t been anything until now and we’re moving forward.”  Milinkovic-Savic recenty told Serbian media outlet Espreso that he was pleased to see the latest round of rumours brought to a close. He said: “The Premier League transfer window is shut, so theManchester Unitedstory is finished. “I wasn’t irritated by everything that was written in the papers, because my mind was concentrated on preparing for the new season in the best possible way. “I am where I am and I want for nothing at Lazio. “I don’t think much about the transfer market. All sorts of things were written about me, but I know where my mind is and who I have a contract with.” Lazio have Milinkovic-Savic tied to a long-term contract through to the end of the 2022-23 season. With that deal in place they are under no pressure to sell, but club president Claudio Lotito conceded earlier this summer that there may come a day when his hand is forced. He said when quizzed on a prized asset: “If an important offer arrives, it is only right the club take it into consideration.” Windows are still open across Europe, but there will be no approaches from the Premier League to fend off until at least January as English top flight clubs have seen their market shut down for 2019.

The Swedish starlet teed up a five-time Ballon d’Or for the first of his three goals against the Canaries at Old Trafford, with an all-time great netting a timely hat-trick in a Premier League fixture that the Red Devils had to win. Elanga joined in with an iconic celebration against the Canaries, with Ronaldo happy to share the limelight as part of a double act rather than have it all to himself – a situation he has grown accustomed to down the years. Elanga has told United’s official website of fluffing his lines somewhat when trying to emulate a talismanic team-mate: “That was an exciting time, the double SIUUU! “I didn't expect it. He said: 'Let's do it'. I said: 'Fair enough' but, if you see in the video, I didn't really get into the air properly! But I managed to do it anyway and it was a special moment. “He is someone I look up to and speak to and ask for advice and stuff. He is a special player to work with.” The 20-year-old forward added on earning the trust of Ronaldo after providing him with another assist: “We spoke about it the day before actually. How we were going to work in terms of pressing. “If you get an opportunity, to look up. If he gets an opportunity, to look up for me, as I'll be in the box or he will be in the box.” Anthony Elanga got the last word 🤫 pic.twitter.com/FV1zfF4RAk Elanga is enjoying a breakthrough campaign in 2021-22, with 24 appearances taken in across all competitions. He has recorded three goals, having made his senior bow last season, and is looking to make the most of an opportunity to work alongside Ronaldo on a daily basis “You can see his record and the amount of goals he's scored. I think it's 100 in the Premier League,” Elanga said of partnering a record-breaking colleague in United’s attack. “He knows what it takes to get to the top so it's more than right to just speak to someone like that. And, yeah, we have a chat the day before or even during a game. You might see us in the warm-up. “He'll speak to me and [Jadon] Sancho together about what we can do in the game, to affect the games, and it's important to have someone like that in the team.” United will be back in Premier League action on Monday when playing host to Brentford.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/rice-warned-off-pointless-man-utd-transfer-by-ex-west-ham/blte8ce7f2a81de3247,Rice warned off 'pointless' Man Utd transfer by ex-West Ham man Ferdinand,"Declan Rice has been warned off a ""pointless"" potential transfer to Manchester United by ex-West Ham defender Anton Ferdinand, who says he should only leave if a club that is ""challenging for the title"" comes calling. Rice has earned a reputation as one of the top midfielders in English football over the past few years, helping West Ham emerge as top-four contenders in the process. The 23-year-old's stellar performances have not gone unnoticed, with United and Chelsea both reportedly eager to bring him onto their books this summer, but Ferdinand doesn't think Old Trafford would be the best place for him to continue his development. West Ham are only two points behind sixth-placed United in the Premier League at the moment, and still have a game in hand, while they are also competing in the Europa League semi-finals. Ferdinand doesn't think the Red Devils would be much of a step up for Rice at the moment, with Erik ten Hag set to begin a rebuilding job at Old Trafford when he arrives from Ajax in the summer. ""Man Utd isn't the place to go right now. They're going through a massive transitional period,"" the former Hammers centre-half has told The Sun. ""For me personally, if I'm Rice, Man Utd is not a place that I'd be going. I'd wait a few years and see what Ten Hag does. Whether he can implement what he did at Ajax at Man Utd and get them looking more like a team that can challenge. ""Otherwise, what's the point in leaving West Ham to go somewhere you're not even challenging for a title. You're challenging to get into Europe. That's what West Ham are doing - challenging to get into the Champions League. ""We've got something to build on. He'd be in the same place at Man Utd and all it would come down to is the stature of the football club. ""As a footballer myself, I'm not going somewhere just because it's a bigger club. You've got everything at a club where you're loved and you're the main man. ""At Man Utd, you'll be one of many. Whereas, you can stay at West Ham and challenge for Europe and be the main man."" Ferdinand added: ""Me personally, I'd rather stay [than join United]. But if it was one of the teams that were fighting for the league, and they came up with the money, it would be hard for West Ham to keep him. ""Like I said, if he did go, as fans we'd appreciate what he has done for the club. He'd always be loved and classed as a legend. ""And if we got £100m-plus for him and it went back into the playing squad, then we can't grumble."" Speculation over Rice's future at West Ham is raging amid reports that he has rejected two lucrative contract extension offers, with his current deal due to expire in 2024. Moyes does not believe the midfielder will seek to move on at the end of the season, though, as he told reporters earlier this week: “I’ve said it [where I stand] and I think we have said what we think. “We like Dec and he’s got three-and-a-half years to go on his contract so I don’t think there is any big panic. “Maybe he just wants more money. People do turn down contracts. It is not unusual for players at clubs to turn down contracts, maybe it's a negotiation tactic.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-real-madrid-van-nistelrooy-appointed-psv-coach/blt11c571fbdd238cd7,Ex-Man Utd and Real Madrid ace Van Nistelrooy appointed PSV coach,"Former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Netherlands star Ruud van Nistelrooy has been unveiled as PSV's new coach from 2022-23 onwards, the Dutch side confirmed on Wednesday. Van Nistelrooy was one of the finest strikers of his generation, scoring more than 300 goals in his career despite repeated battles with injury. He will now embark on his first senior coaching job at one of the Eredivisie's top sides. ""PSV has appointed 45-year-old former striker Ruud van Nistelrooy as their new manager on a 2025 contract to replace Roger Schmidt, who will leave his post at the end of the season when his contract ends,"" PSV explained in a statement published on the club's official website. ✔ PSV U19✔ Assistant coach @OnsOranje & PSV✔ Jong PSVReady for the next step: 𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗣𝗦𝗩 𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗺. Van Nistelrooy said: “It has always been my dream to be head coach at PSV. “I’ve worked intensively with Toon Gerbrands, PSV’s current General Manager, the past few seasons. ""I was convinced I could pursue a professional coaching career and originally thought I needed one more year to gain experience. ""But sometimes things do go their way and you find out that life is not completely manageable. This is the right moment to take the next step.” Van Nistelrooy's ties with PSV go back a long way. The forward came to prominence at the club after smashing 77 goals in 90 games between 1998 and 2000, a record which helped them to back-to-back league titles and also prompted United to take him to Old Trafford. At United and later Madrid, the Dutchman added three Premier League and Liga crowns to his collection and also finished as the Champions League top scorer in three different seasons, though he never got his hands on the European crown. A serious knee injury in 2008 while playing for Madrid curtailed his career at the top level and Van Nistelrooy hung up his boots four years later after spells at Hamburg and PSV. He then turned his hand to coaching, spending time as Dick Advocaat's Netherlands assistant and most recently as part of the youth set-up at PSV. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/noni-madueke-psv-english-teen-star-turned-down-man-utd/k46l9p2jgeep1h1sslkxcs4pc,Noni Madueke: PSV's English teen star who turned down Man Utd,"It is no secret that an increasingnumber of young British footballers are exploring opportunities overseas in a bid to earn first-team minutes atan earlier age. Jadon Sancho has proven trailblazer in this regard, inspiring a number of teenagers to follow the Borussia Dortmund starto the Bundesliga. However, Germany's top -flight is not the only league offering youngsters a chance to progress. In Eredivisie, for example, there is a young English talent aiming to make as big an impact at PSV this season as Sancho did during his breakout campaign atDortmund in 2018-19. That player is Noni Madueke. ""[Sancho] has opened the eyes to other talents,” the 18-year-old forward, who joined PSV from Tottenham in 2018,told Voetbal International. “A year after him, I went from Spurs to PSV. The plan that I had in mind then is now workingout the way I intended it. ""In England, it is very difficult as a young talent to get into the first team, especially at the bigger clubs. The squads are very large andthere is little room for youngsters. They often stay in reserve teams for a long time orare loaned out. ""There is little flow or chance to break through. That is completely different in the Netherlands."" Having taken his first steps into the senior ranks in Eindhoven before Covid-19 brought a premature end to the 2019-20 campaign, Madueke is now set to play a key role for the Dutch giants. Before making the switch from England to continental Europe, Madueke spent the entirety of his youth football career at Tottenham, where he captained the club's Under-16s as well as making his debut for the U18s as a 15-year-old. Having been named Player of the Tournament at the prestigious Sonnenland Cup in Germany in 2017, a number of top clubs began to take notice of his potential. Manchester United made an offer to take him north, while Chelsea and Celtic were also linked with his signature. But it was PSV who won the race, with Madueke keen to ensure he earned first-team football sooner rather than later. ""There are so many young players in first teams at the top levelat PSV orAjax,” Madueke told the Daily Mailof the Eredivisie a year on from his arrival in Eindhoven. ""Players like Frenkie de Jong andall of these guys. Skip skip skip 😌 A post shared by  Noni Tristan Madueke (@nonzinoo10) on Dec 23, 2019 at 10:01am PST ""I thought if I want to get to the first team as quickly as possible, then I have to move from Tottenham and come to PSV. ""As long as I keep doing the things they are telling me, I feel like I’ll reach that first-team level sooneras opposed to if I had stayed at Tottenham."" Despite the prospect of opportunities with the senior side, Madueke has had to work his way through ranks during his two years at PSV. Upon his arrival he was introduced into the U17s squad, but after scoring three goals in as many games in December 2018 he was handed a permanent promotion to the U19s, for whom he netted a further four goals that season. In 2019-20, he took his game to new levels, scoring seven goals and providing eight assists in just 11 appearances for the U19sduring the first half of the campaign. Such returns saw him rewarded with a promotion to the Jong PSV squad, who play in the Dutch second division. In six games, he scored four goals, and by early March he was again changing lockers after officially being named as part of the first-team squad. Having made three substitute appearances earlier in the campaign, Madueke's first senior start came against Groningen on March 8, though that turned out to be PSV's final game of the season before coronavirus forced football in the Netherlands to go into hiding. The England youth international played his part in a 1-0 win, and two days later signed a new contract which will keep him at the club until 2024, despite increased interest from Arsenal, Manchester City, RB Leipzig, Valencia and Wolves since the turn of the year. Done Deal! #2024 🙌🏾 A post shared by  Noni Tristan Madueke (@nonzinoo10) on Mar 10, 2020 at 10:07am PDT Blessed with speed, skill and physicality, Madueke has spent much of his young career playing as a winger or wide forward who cuts inside from the right to either score or create goals. However, new PSV boss Roger Schmidt has arrived at Philips Stadion with a plan to play 4-4-2, meaning if Madueke is to earn more opportunities he must now adapt his game so as to become a central striker. He made the perfect start during pre-season, netting a first-half hat-trick against lower-league SC Verle that included a stunning solo strike to secure him the match ball. ""I'm not surprised. He already scored a lot of goals in training. He feels comfortable up front and doesn't have to be a winger,"" Schmidt toldDe Telegraafafter Madueke's superb display of finishing. ""Noni's timing is often very good and he has a good feeling for free space. ""I'm also very happy with his mentality. He is a good fighterand is capable of reading the situation.""  Former PSV midfielder Tommie van de Leegte is excited by what Madueke can provide in his potential new role, telling Omroep Brabant: ""He's fast and has the capability to trick his opponent. He brings creativity and is very explosive in his actions. That's what PSV needs. ""Yes, he's young, but age doesn't matter to me. He has shown himself inpre-season, so I would give him the chance to prove himself in the big games as well."" Though Madueke was not included in Schmidt's starting line-up for PSV's Eredivisie opener against Groningen on Sunday, he certainly did prove himself after coming off the bench in the second half. The teenager provided two assists to help secure a 3-1 win, and it will surely not be long before he is earning regular starts just over two years since the biggest decision his young career. “I wanted to be in the first team as young as possible, at the age of 17or 18,"" Madueke said 12 months ago. ""At a club like Tottenham that is not feasible –you only come into the picture around the age of 20. ""That is why I chose PSV two years ago and what is happeningnow with all the opportunities I get is exactly what I had in mind at the time. ""My choice has provento be the right one.""

https://www.goal.com/en/news/who-will-buy-chelsea-conor-mcgregor-nick-candy-candidates/blt2f72d34bd983be1e,"Who will buy Chelsea? Conor McGregor, Nick Candy & candidates for Abramovich to sell Blues to","Roman Abramovich may have seen his assets frozen by the UK government due to connections with Russian president Vladimir Putin, but Chelsea remain up for sale and a takeover could still go through if the right licenses and guarantees are obtained. With that in mind, a race to secure ownership of Premier League heavyweights - and the current holders of a prestigious Champions League crown - is on, with multi-billion pound bids now in the pipeline. A number of potential stakeholders at Stamford Bridge have emerged as interest builds steadily, from UFC superstars to wealthy supporters of the west London club, but who are those in the running? GOAL takes a look... An avid Chelsea supporter, billionaire property developer Candy has been talking to a group of American investors about forming a consortium to buy the Blues. His £2.5bn ($3.3bn) proposal is said to include plans for a £1.5bn ($2bn) rebuild of Stamford Bridge, while the 49-year-old – who is married to former Neighbours actress Holly Valance – has made it clear that he would look to put fellow fans at the heart of his regime. Candy has told Sky Sports of the reasons for his interest: ""I’ve supported Chelsea since the age of four. My dad was asked to play for Chelsea. I love Chelsea. ""I don’t mind where it ends up, even if it is not with me, as long as it is in safe hands."" The 86-year-old emerged as an early frontrunner after revealing long before Abramovich formally put Chelsea up for sale that he had been offered the chance to invest in the club alongside three other parties. The Swiss – who is said to be worth £4.3bn ($5.6bn) after founding American medical device business Synthes – has claimed that Abramovich will need to lower his asking price in order for a deal to go through. He has said: “Abramovich is currently asking far too much. You know, Chelsea owe him £2 billion. But Chelsea has no money. That means, those who buy Chelsea should compensate Abramovich. “As of today, we don't know the exact selling price. I can well imagine starting at Chelsea with partners. But I have to examine the general conditions first. But what I can already say, I'm definitely not doing something like this alone. If I buy Chelsea, then with a consortium consisting of six to seven investors.” The U.S. tycoon is one of those said to be interested in entering into a partnership with Wyss. The co-founder, chairman and CEO of Eldridge Industries, who has a net worth of £4.72bn ($6.1bn), had two bids for Chelsea knocked back in 2019 and is a huge sports fan after already acquiring stakes in MLB side the Los Angeles Dodgers and NBA heavyweights the LA Lakers. One of the more surprising candidates to have thrown his hat into the ring, the Irish MMA fighter saw his interest piqued once it was announced that Abramovich was looking for a buyer. He tweeted “I wish to explore this, Chelsea” when responding to WhatsApp message in which a contact said: “Chelsea for sale, £3bn. Let's buy it.” McGregor is famously a supporter of Manchester United and has previously expressed interest in wrestling control of the Red Devils from the Glazer family. He has also said that he is interested in getting involved with Scottish Premiership team Celtic. A Turkish businessman that made his £8bn ($10bn) fortune as chairman of AB Group Holding – a company which invests in tourism, cryptocurrency and construction – Bayrak is said to have met with Abramovich to discuss a possible deal. He has, however, cast doubt over whether he would be welcomed to west London, saying: “I think they don't want Turkey to buy the club. Everyone should know that the Republic of Turkey is a very big state. Very serious business people come out of this state, and we exist and will be all over the world.” GOAL has been able to confirm that Broughton has held discussions about playing a role in bids that are being prepared for Chelsea. He was previously involved in the deal that saw Fenway Sports Group bring the disastrous reign of Tom Hicks and George Gillett at Liverpool to an end in 2010. Broughton, who is a former chairman of British Airways, is negotiating with backers about tabling his own offer, although he faces a race against time to generate the funds required to enter the bidding. Another fanatical Chelsea supporter that harbours dreams of taking control of the club he loves. Reuben’s father and uncle – who form part of a £12bn ($15.6bn) business - bought a 10 per cent stake in Newcastle last year when a £300m ($391m) takeover at St James’ Park was completed, but he could head out on his own. A man that boasts the likes of Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton and Boris Johnson among his friendship group could find it difficult to get a green light from the Premier League, though, due to his family ties with top-flight rivals on Tyneside. Another of the bidders to have a redevelopment of Stamford Bridge within their grand plans for Chelsea. An approach from the Middle East is being spearheaded by Mohamed Alkhereiji, who runs Saudi Media and is CEO of the Engineer Holding Group parent company which was founded by his father Abdulelah Alkhereiji. The company turns over more than £1bn ($1.3bn) a year, while Alkhereiji is a Blues supporter and was in attendance during Abramovich’s last visit to Stamford Bridge in November 2021. Despite being a lifelong Manchester United supporter, a man with a £20bn ($26bn) fortune has been a season ticket holder at Chelsea for several years. Ratcliffe – who runs multi-national chemicals company Ineos - is the owner of French side Lille and has admitted to holding talks regarding a deal for the Blues. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: “There was some early exchange but we were a significant way apart on valuations. “The issue with Chelsea is its stadium. We are all getting older and it is a decade of your life to resolve that.” Among the others to have been linked with Chelsea are New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, while there has been talk of Moneyball mogul Billy Beane forming part of a bidding consortium. Jayed Afridi, who owns an automobile company and is CEO of consumer electrics giants Haier Pakistan, has been mooted as another potential bidder, along with Michael Rubin – the owner of sports merchandise group Fanatics, a company worth over £20bn ($26bn). Abramovich is said to have acquired Chelsea for just £140m ($182m) back in 2003, with the club enduring serious financial difficulties at that time. He has pumped considerable funding into the club over the course of a 19-year tenure and said investment has allowed 21 trophies to be secured – with that haul including five Premier League titles and two Champions League crowns. The Russian billionaire was said to have put a £3bn ($4bn) asking price on Chelsea when looking to sell, but questions have been asked of that valuation and he is no longer allowed to profit from any agreement after being sanctioned by the UK government. Anyone looking to do a deal, as the Blues work their way through a testing period off the field, must have best and final offers on the table at Stamford Bridge by Friday March 18.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/chiesa-injury-nightmare-juventus-transfer-problems/blt18c24820bd46d0fd,Chiesa injury adds to Juventus' transfer problems ahead of daunting Supercoppa showdown with Inter,"Three days on and it is still hard to know exactly what to make of Juventus' insane 4-3 victory at Roma, certainly from the visitors' perspective. Was it an anomaly or a turning point? The Bianconeri are still buzzing, of course. As captain Giorgio Chiellini admitted on Tuesday, it was the kind of win that ""gives you an adrenaline boost"". Marco Landucci had been on the Juventus bench in Rome and Allegri, who was forced to sit in the stands through suspension, was full of praise for his assistant coach, quipping on the eve of Wednesday's Supercoppa Italian showdown with Inter, ""He did really well. In fact, I thought about not turning up tomorrow!"" Landucci, though, will be happy to have his boss back alongside him in the dugout, having admitted that he ""lost five or six years of my life"" watching Juve come from 3-1 down to triumph at the Olimpico, despite the late concession of a penalty and loss of Matthijs de Ligt to a red card. Juve are now unbeaten in seven Serie A games and sit fifth in the standings, just three points behind Atalanta, though the fourth-placed Bergamaschi have played one game fewer. On the face of it, then, the Old Lady seems to have fully recovered from a shocking start to the season and is now perfectly primed to force her way back into the Champions League places. Doubts persist, though. After all, sometimes results can be misleading. Juventus have performed poorly for the majority of the season, and they had only scored 28 times in 20 matches going into Sunday's game. It must also be acknowledged that they were dire for more than an hour at the Stadio Olimpico. Allegri's introduction of Arthur and Alvaro Morata undoubtedly changed the game, and he undeniably deserves credit for his double substitution. Of course, his critics – and their numbers are increasing – would argue that the coach's conservatism has been responsible for Juve's poor productivity this term. They now hope that Allegri will see the benefits of playing Arthur in midfield alongside Manuel Locatelli and will abandon the 4-4-2 formation they deem embarrassingly outdated. Nobody is quite sure how the Tuscan will line his players up against Inter, though – not least because he will have to make do without some key men. Neither Alex Sandro nor Leonardo Bonucci are 100 per cent match fit, Danilo is injured, Juan Cuadrado and De Ligt are both suspended, while Wojciech Szczesny has not yet secured his Covid-19 Green Pass. Of greater significance, though, is the absence of Federico Chiesa. “Forza Federico”💪@GoalItalia pic.twitter.com/9jpYyxhNOl The Euro 2020 star suffered knee ligament damage in the first half of the Roma win and it has since been confirmed that his campaign is over. It is, as Chiellini pointed out, a devastating blow for not just Juve, but Italian football in general, with the winger now also ruled out of March's crucial World Cup play-offs. Even if the Azzurri were to make it to Qatar, there is no guarantee that Chiesa will be fit to feature there either. It is also unclear how Juve will react to his lengthy lay-off. At the very least, it is going to affect their January transfer plans, which were already shrouded in uncertainty because of Paulo Dybala, who was all set to sign an extension beyond the summer but is now set to be offered a new contract worth less than the €10 million (£8.3m/$11.3m) deal he had previously agreed with the club. As previously reported by GOAL, the Bianconeri are desperate to bring in a centre-forward and a central midfielder during the winter window, but they are being severely hampered by their financial issues. Consequently, the hope was that they could raise funds by cashing in on one of their few valuable assets deemed surplus to requirements by Allegri. Dejan Kulusevski was the most likely departure, given he has plenty of admirers in England. However, the versatile Sweden attacker is now the most obvious internal replacement for Chiesa. Allegri has, thus far, demonstrated a distinct lack of faith in Kulusevski, but even if he were to deem Federico Bernardeschi or Cuadrado better options out wide, it still seems unlikely that he would now sanction Kulusevski's sale. ""I talked to him [on Monday],"" Allegri revealed on the eve of the Supercoppa. ""He has great qualities and he can cover various roles. He's starting to understand Juve, as everyone needs to make a jump in quality on a mental level. ""Determination can change a player's career. It's also important that he finds the maturity required for playing certain games."" At the very least, Kulusevski's versatility should ensure he remains in Turin until the summer at least. Consequently, the chances of U.S. men's national team star Weston McKennie being sacrificed in January have risen, particularly with Juve trying to figure out a way to bring in Bruno Guimaraes from Lyon, who want €45m (£36m/$51m) for the Brazilian. The Bianconeri don't have the cash to make that deal happen right now but they could at least make space in their squad – and lower their wage bill in the process – by offloading Arthur, whom Arsenal are interested in taking on loan. Juve's priority, though, remains a centre-forward. Morata made a big impact at Roma, and Allegri insists the Spain striker is staying put despite agreeing personal terms with Barcelona, but Juve have no intention of taking up their option to buy the 29-year-old from Atletico Madrid at the end of the season. Their top target remains Gianluca Scamacca, but the Old Lady is simply not in a position to meet Sassuolo's €40m (£33m/$45m) asking price, and there is no chance of the Neroverdi letting the striker leave on loan midway through the season. It is a similar story with Mauro Icardi. Paris Saint-Germain want either a permanent deal or an obligation to buy inserted into any temporary transfer of the ex-Inter captain. Liverpool super-sub Divock Origi and Manchester United's frustrated French forward Anthony Martial have also been repeatedly mentioned but, again, neither player is expected to leave on loan without at least some money being paid up front. The most likely outcome is a short-term solution, with Sky Sport Italia claiming that the Bianconeri have made contact with Zenit about signing Sardar Azmoun, who is out of contract at the end of the season. Allegri, for his part, insists that the squad will remain unchanged between now and the end of the month. He is merely focused on maintaining the momentum built up over the past six weeks by winning the first trophy of his second spell in Turin. ""We need to think game by game in order to reach those ahead of us [in the table],"" Allegri argued in his pre-match press conference, ""and next season we will see if we have done enough to get back fighting for the Scudetto."" Beating Inter will not be easy of course. The reigning Serie A champions and current league leaders are almost everything that Juve are not right now: prolific, solid and 100 per cent sure of themselves. Allegri himself acknowledges Inter are the strongest team in Italy, while Chiellini says he knew as far back as September that the title was theirs to lose. Juve, then, could be in for a long evening. But, at the very least, the Supercoppa should shed far more light on how much work the Old Lady has to do to get back to the summit of Serie A than last Sunday’s insanity at Stadio Olimpico.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/life-after-ronaldo-how-juventus-are-coping-without-cristiano/i7zn0g5c9t1t18qz0qiq6cfyx,Life after Ronaldo? How Juventus are coping without Cristiano,"It wasn’t Cristiano Ronaldo’s Juventus departure which shocked his former team-mates. It was the timing. It had been clear for months that the Portugal international wanted out. He repeatedly passed up opportunities to commit his future to the club, most amusingly when he lashed out at the media for reporting his desire to return to Real Madrid, even though one of his closest associates, Edu Aguirre of El Chiringuito, had sparked the speculation in typically over-the-top fashion live on Spanish television. Ronaldo claimed that such talk was “disrespectful to all of the clubs involved in these rumours, as well as to their players and staff”, and yet not once did he mention Juventus in a 286-word statement on social media. The writing had long been on the wall, of course. During Euro 2020, he would only say: ""Whether I stay at Juventus or leave, whatever happens will be for the best."" However, while there were – and are – obvious advantages to his eventual transfer to Manchester United for the Bianconeri, most notably from a financial perspective,his decision to leave fourdays before the close of the summer transfer window had a negative impact on his colleagues. As captain Giorgio Chiellini told DAZN, “Ronaldo left on August 27. It would have been better for us if he had left earlier.“We paid something for it, a little bit of a shock, we paid something for it in terms of points. If he had left earlier, we would have had time to prepare better.”  As it was, Ronaldo’s move to Manchester was confirmed a matter of hours beforeJuventus were beaten at home by Empoli in their second game of the new Serie A season. The international break presented coach Massimiliano Allegri, back at the helm after two years away, with a much-needed opportunity to take stock, but his still shell-shocked side were beaten again upon their return to action, at Napoli, and were then held to a draw at home by AC Milan. At the close of play on matchday four, the mighty Juventus were in the Serie A relegation zone.It was obvious that Ronaldo’s lethal finishing was being sorely missed - but it went beyond mere goals. For the previous three seasons, ever since the arrival of the prolific Portuguese from Real Madrid, Juve’s primary focus had become getting the very best out of their No.7. As centre-back Leonardo Bonucci said earlier this week, “the team played for [Ronaldo].” However, the Euro 2020 winner also acknowledged that the players were guilty of expecting miracles from Ronaldo whenever they found themselves in a tight spot. “We were all playing with a great champion and wanted him to do well,” Bonucci explained to reporters, “so perhaps we lost that desire to all suffer and sacrifice ourselves together, because we assumed he would sort it out."" Bonucci believes that Allegri has, at least, already addressed the attitude problem, arguing that the passion and resilience they have demonstrated in racking up six successive wins in all competitions proves that the players have rediscovered that ""Juve spirit that was there before Ronaldo’s arrival"". ""The coach has done really well to get that character and humility back,"" he enthused. “We all work together now to get the result."" Waking up with this energy! 🔋💪#ZenitJuve #JuveUCL pic.twitter.com/3RalE2ch1Y That Juvehave won their last four games 1-0 also suggests that Allegri has resolved the defensive issues which preceded his summer return. Before Manuel Locatelli scored the only goal in the derby against Torino at the start of this month, the Old Lady hadn’t kept a clean sheet in the league since the 3-0 defeat of Spezia on March 2. Of course, one of the principal reasons for Juve’s sudden stinginess is the fact that they are playing a more negative brand of football, often sitting deep against decent footballing sides in the hope of hitting their opponents on the break, or nicking a goal off a set-piece. Such an approach can only last so long. Juve, after all, are still playing catch-up in Serie A. They may be rapidly rising up the table but they are still only seventh, seven points behind Napoli.The onus is on them to close the gap and they will only be able to continue winning games if they add more goals to their game. Paulo Dybala’s return from injury for this weekend’s Derby d’Italia is, therefore, a most welcome boost. The Argentine remains Juve’s joint-top scorer in all competitions with three goals–even though he has missed five games through injury. It was Chiellini, remember, who tipped Dybala to take command of the Juve attack following Ronaldo’s exit.   And yet, for all of the financial and tactical conundrums that the Portuguese presented, the Bianconeri could always rely on him to score goals (Ronaldoalready has six in eight games for United). They can’t even rely on Dybala to stay fit. However, the hope is that his returnwill at least lighten the load on Federico Chiesa, who kickstarted Juve’s campaign with a virtuoso showing at Spezia on matchday five, while also netting the winner in their morale-boosting 1-0 win over Chelsea in the Champions League. The Italy winger still needs to add even more goals to his game but there is no denying his status as one of the best big-game players in the world right now – which obviously bodes well ahead of Sunday’s trip to San Siro. Of course, if Juve are to maintain their winning streak against free-scoring Inter, who have netted nearly twice as many goals as the Bianconeri in the league this season (23-12), they are likely to have to once again produce a heroic rearguard action. And that doesn’t just mean Chiellini & Co. doing their jobs. Allegri will need his infamously unreliable and unbalanced midfield to protect his back four and his forwards to defend from the front. Still, on the evidence of what we’ve seen in recent weeks, Bonucci may well be proven right: Ronaldo’s goals may be gone but Juve’s fighting spirit does at least seem to have returned.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/englands-no1-who-are-the-favourites-to-be-goalkeeper-for/nib2z3et77tl1lyqpqczvfac1,England's No.1: Who are the favourites to be goalkeeper for Euro 2021?,"Now that Euro 2020 has been pushed back to Euro 2021, England's dilemma over their goalkeeping situationhas been pushed firmly into the back seat. Gareth Southgate had been facing a difficult call over who would start between the posts for the Three Lions'opening group gameagainst Croatia on June 14. Now, those vying for the position will have some extra time to find their form and stake a claim to be England's No.1. For England’s disastrous campaign at Euro 2016,it was Joe Hart, Tom Heaton and Fraser Forster who made the cut -but none of the three were in the squad for the World Cup two years later. The gloves are there to be won – but who are the contenders to wear them? Everton goalkeeper Pickford is the favourite to start the first game, by virtue of being England’s current No.1. The 26-year-old now has well over 100 Premier League appearances under his belt, as well as 24 full international caps. Pickford won plaudits for his displays at the 2018 World Cup, and  was instrumental in the penalty shoot-out win over Colombia. However, his club form has been erratic in recent seasons. Southgate has faced calls to drop himafter a number of high-profile mistakes, and he is far from guaranteed the starting spot he might have expected to have at this point of his career. With 29 games played, Pickford has kept just six clean sheets in the Premier League this season. He recently hit back at criticism from pundits including Gary Neville, saying ""everyone hates you"" as an England player. Currently leading the Premier League clean sheets chart is Burnley’s Pope, and the 27-year-old may feelthe Euros are his opportunityto shine. The shot-stopper currently has just two senior international caps to his name, having found himself behind Pickford and Hart in the past. That relative inexperience may have hurt his chances, with Southgate perhaps unwilling to make such a big call on the cusp of an international tournament. Now, he has more time on his side. Regardless, he has inarguably been one of the stand-out performers in his position in the Premier League this season. Pope has also kept clean sheets on both of his England appearances to date – a 2-0 friendly win over Costa Rica in 2018, and a 4-0 thrashing of Kosovo in Europeanqualifying in November 2019. Henderson has enjoyed a breakthrough campaign with Sheffield United this season, his first in the Premier League. On loan from Manchester United, Henderson has registered 10 clean sheets from 27 league games, and is many fans’ favourite to start at the Euros. There are currently questions around his club future, with  calls for him to replace the declining David de Gea at Old Traffordnext season. Such a move would help his chances, providing he continues to start regularly. Like Pope, his lack of caps mean it would be a surprise to see Southgate pick him to start over the more experienced Pickford. Henderson is yet to make his senior international debut, but should be expected to make the final squad to gain experience of an international tournament. A number of other goalkeepers have made a claim this season and could make the squad, though it would be a shock to see any of them play. Aaron Ramsdale  has broken into Bournemouth’s first team at the age of 21 and could be sent to gain experience, though the Cherries’ struggles are evidenced by his meagre tally of four clean sheets. Fraser Forster, who once looked like taking the No.1 shirt during his time at Southampton, is first-choice once again at Celtic and may be keen to add to his six caps to date. More experienced is the 36-year-old  Ben Foster, though he has a similar number of senior international appearances with eight. And despite Watford fighting relegation, he has more clean sheets to his name than De Gea, Ederson, Bernd Leno, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Rui Patricio – and Pickford. Alex McCarthy  of Southampton turned 30 at the end of last year and has been called up to the England squad on a number of occasions, though he only has one appearance to show for it. He played in a 3-0 win over the United States in November 2018, but is slipping off the radar as he battles with 24-year-old  Angus Gunn  for the goalkeeping position at Southampton.

Reason for Man Utd star's absence explained,"England will be in international friendly action against Switzerland at Wembley Stadium on Saturday, before then playing host to Ivory Coast on Tuesday, but Marcus Rashford will not be figuring in either of those fixtures. The Manchester United forward has represented his country on 46 occasions, scoring 12 goals, but will not be adding to his collection of Three Lions caps any time soon after being overlooked in the latest selection made by Gareth Southgate. Why has the Red Devils star been overlooked and could his place in plans being drawn up for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar later this year be under threat? GOAL takes a look… The 24-year-old has been a regular for England since bursting onto the scene as a teenager in 2016, with appearances made at two European Championships – including a Euro 2020 final against Italy – the 2018 World Cup and UEFA Nations League finals. His domestic form has, however, dipped in the 2021-22 campaign – on the back of becoming an MBE for his charity work off the field – and Southgate is looking for a proven performer to rediscover a spark at Old Trafford before being welcomed back into the international arena.

He knows he is in a situation where he has not been getting in the United team consistently and he will be searching as much as anybody to get that form back. “We all believe he can be an asset for his club and for his country. “With one or two of our players in the past, who have had dips and come through them, you can say, 'look, they came through that, they responded well and became more strong and they showed the character needed'. “That is what he is going to have to prove now in the coming weeks and months. Nobody's career goes smoothly from start to finish and of course his rise from when he first broke into the team at United was incredible, really.” Southgate is right to suggest that Rashford needs to knuckle down at club level and work on becoming a first -team regular for Manchester United once more.

Ibrahimovic joined United on a free transfer following his departure from Paris Saint-Germain in 2016, reuniting with former Inter boss Jose Mourinho, who he had previously played under at San Siro in 2008-09. The Swede quickly became a cult figure at Old Trafford as he helped the Red Devils win a domestictreble in his first season at the club, after initially telling Cantona that he was aiming to surpass the Frenchman's own stellar legacy. Cantona is widely regarded as one of the finest players in United's history, having inspired their run to four Premier League titles in five seasons between 1992 and 1997, but Ibrahimovic has now revealed that he rejected the suggestion he would have to play in his shadow. The 40-year-old, who is currently taking in a second spell at AC Milan, told Italian broadcaster   Le lene   while out celebrating his birthday at the weekend: ""One day Cantona said to me: 'You cannot be the king of Manchester, you will have to be content with being the prince'. ""And I replied: 'But I'm not interested in becoming king, I want to be the god of Manchester'."" Cantona scored  82   goals  in  185appearances  for the Red Devils in total, winning nine trophies, while also picking up the 1993-94 PFA Players' Player of the Year award. Ibrahimovic, meanwhileonly spent two seasons at Old Trafford, the second of which was disrupted by a serious knee injury, but he managed to record  29 goals  in  53 appearances  while securing Europa League, League Cup and Community Shield honours. Ibrahimovic rejoined Milan in January 2020 after a successful stint in MLS with the LA Galaxy, and has since played a key role in helping the Rossoneri emerge as a major force inSerie A. The veteran forward is currently out of action with an Achilles issue  , but is optimistic that he will return to the pitch soon after the international break. ""Yes, it is better, only small problems but they are solved,"" Ibrahimovic said when quizzed on his fitness. ""I feel young, another year has passed and I'm just waiting to get back on the pitch."" Pressed on Milan's chances of winning Serie A this term, he added:""Who wins the Scudetto? What team does Zlatan play for...Milan? Then Milan.""

https://www.goal.com/en/news/ibrahimovic-retirement-keep-playing-until-someone-better/blt3a28369b1bc12f5c,Ibrahimovic on retirement: I'll keep playing until I see someone better than me,"AC Milan star Zlatan Ibrahimovic has opened up on his plans for the future amid rumours over a potential retirement. The former Manchester United man is still going strong in Italy, defying his age as he continues to play a crucial role for his side. The striker's career spans over 20 years and it seems he has no plans to end his time in professional football anytime soon. According to UEFA, Ibrahimovic said: ""The future is yet to be written. I don't plan. Let's see what happens. ""I don't want to regret stopping football and then saying that I could continue to play football because then I'd regret it for the rest of my life, seeing that I could have continued. ""I want to play as long as I can. The reality is I'll play until I see that someone is better than me, so I'm still playing. ""I know one day it will stop and I won't have that adrenaline anymore. This is a problem for every football player because you have adrenaline when you play football. ""That adrenaline, you will never get in doing something else because we are programmed. Every day we do the same thing. ""We wake up, we prepare, we train, we eat, and we rest. The next day, it's the same thing. For 20 years, you do these things, and you get adrenaline from them. ""So when suddenly you stop, you don't have this agenda, you don't get the adrenaline anymore. And when it stops, you have to take it from there and begin from zero and start something new."" The Swede has struggled with injuries this season but still managed to make 22 appearances across all competitions, scoring eight goals and grabbing two assists. His total record in Milan, including his first spell, stands at 154 appearances with 92 goals and 34 assists, so it's easy to see why he's loved at the club. Ibrahimovic's long career has seen him become a journeyman of sorts as he's played for a host of Europe's top clubs including PSG, Inter, Ajax, Juventus and Barcelona.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/rip-mino-raiola-king-of-the-super-agents/bltdce77619e5ec3a1f,RIP Mino Raiola: King of the super-agents,"Mino Raiola had an accountancy firm called Maguire Tax & Legal, its name inspired by an Oscar-winning movie starring Tom Cruise. Many of his adversaries within the game were offended by the insinuation he was any way similar to Jerry Maguire, the fictional sports agent who comes to champion love (or 'kwan') over greed. However, his clients would always tell you the comparison was just; that he formed a special bond with each and every one of them. Such polarised opinions perfectly illustrated the way in which Raiola divided the football world. He will forever be remembered as one of its most controversial yet compelling characters, seemingly loved and loathed in equal measures, a self-styled super-agent doing right by clients, but wrong by clubs. The 54-year-old was born in Agri, Italy, but his parents emigrated to Netherlands when he was still an infant, settling in Haarlem. It was in this Dutch municipality that Raiola was raised before taking the first steps to becoming arguably the 'king of super-agents'. Raiola was a moderately talented player in his youth and he played for his local club before quitting the game at just 18. However, while he started studying law, he had not lost his passion for football, electing to take charge of the Haarlem youth team. pic.twitter.com/xuZWBNA62N Even at such a tender age, Raiola was a straight-talker with a distinct lack of respect for any figure of authority other than his restaurateur father. “The president of Haarlem came to eat with us every Friday,” he explained in an interview with Il Secolo XIX in 2011. “I was always telling him that he knew nothing about football. ""One day he takes me aside and says: ‘Listen, you try it.’ He appointed me sporting director.” Raiola, though, became frustrated by his inability to make what he believed were the requisite changes due to a lack of funds. However, with Dutch players very much in vogue in the mid-1980s, he saw that there was money to be made in selling his adopted nation’s top footballing talent to Italy, which was then the centre of the footballing universe. Raiola, having honed his skills as a mediator while working as a broker for Dutch businessmen with commercial interests in Italy, negotiated a deal with the players' union in the Netherlands that enabled him to represent all of the country’s footballers. His goal at this point was to establish a special working relationship with Napoli, “the club of my heart”. However, the deal collapsed. ""I called [then Partenopei president Corrado] Ferlaino and we started the collaboration,"" he later explained. ""I offered him [Dennis] Bergkamp for 700 million lire [€362,000]. He hesitated. Two years later [1993], he offered €14 million, but I gave the player to Inter."" With the Bergkamp deal, which also saw Wim Jonk join the Nerazzurri from Ajax, Raiola had established himself as a major player in Serie A, the deal coming as it did a year after Bryan Roy's successful switch from Amsterdam to Foggia. What was clear at this juncture was that Raiola was as adept at pleasing his clients as upsetting their clubs. Indeed, Ajax, who had profited substantially from Raiola-arranged deals during the early 1990s, were less enamoured with the way in which star forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic left for Juventus in 2004. Their ill-feeling only intensified two years later when the fallout from Calciopoli led to the release of the following recorded telephone exchanges between then Bianconeri managing director Luciano Moggi and Raiola: Moggi: ""You and Ibra continue to make trouble. Don't send him to training ..."" Raiola: ""Tomorrow, I'll keep the player at home all day; he won't show up for training. I then have an appointment with the directors of Ajax at noon, but I'll come at two ..."" Raiola's influence on players was also questioned by Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson during his club’s ultimately futile attempts to persuade former midfielder Paul Pogba to remain at Old Trafford in 2012. The Scot subsequently admitted that he and Raiola took an instant dislike to one another, saying they were like ""water and oil"". Raiola's relationship with Pep Guardiola was even worse, with the agent labelling the Catalan a ""coward"" and a ""dog"", and even suggesting that the former Barcelona boss should have been sent to a psychiatric hospital for not playing Ibrahimovic. Raiola also claimed that he ""went for"" Guardiola after the 2011 Champions League final at Wembley but was held back by then-AC Milan CEO Adriano Galliani. ""Lucky for Guardiola!"" Raiola quipped. In his eyes, his willingness to literally fight for his clients underlined his commitment to their cause, while he always insisted that he did not engineer transfers, but merely facilitated them. ""I think that when a player decides to leave a team he should leave,"" he reasoned. ""I have never made compromises; I work exclusively in the interest of my client. ""The players are my fortune and I have a great responsibility towards them.However, I have never carried out improper activity or activity that I, personally, do not think proper. ""The old agents favoured the interests of the club. For me, the player comes first.” And that is precisely why they continued to flock to him. From Ibrahimovic and Pogba to Erling Haaland and Gigi Donnarumma, Raiola remained arguably the most influential agent in football right up until his untimely death at the age of 54. Football agent Mino Raiola has passed away aged 54, his family have announced.RIP. pic.twitter.com/SdSKUoiJux There were always question marks over the size of his cuts, but that was part of a broader debate over the role of agents within the game. Whatever one's view of Raiola's role in transfers, there is no denying that this was a man with a unique way with words who knew not only to sell himself, but also his players. He spoke eight languages (Italian, Dutch, French, English, German, Spanish, Portuguese and ""of course Neapolitan"") and had a particular flair for hyperbole. He memorably compared Pogba with a Salvador Dali painting and claimed that Ibrahimovic’s move to Paris Saint-Germain finally provided visitors to the French capital with something to see other than the Mona Lisa. For all his bombast, though, he rather humbly puts his impressive linguistic capabilities down to ""preparation, not intelligence"". Ultimately, there was a contradiction at the core of Raiola's work, and his character. He said he resolved problems. His detractors claimed that he created them. Perhaps the truth was somewhere in between – and perhaps utterly irrelevant because the bottom line is that Raiola made money. Both for his clients – and himself. ""We live in a cynical world,"" as Dicky Fox says in 'Jerry Maguire'. ""A cynical world. And we work in a business of tough competitors."" Raiola was undoubtedly one of the toughest competitors in his particular field, which probably also made him the best. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/ibrahimovic-declares-himself-the-greatest-ever-mls-player-i/blt65c1cd38a32794b3,Ibrahimovic declares himself the greatest ever MLS player: 'I was still too alive',"Zlatan Ibrahimovic has declared himself the “best player to ever play in MLS” and claimed he was “too good for the whole competition” during his two-year spell with the Los Angeles Galaxy. Ibrahimovic scored 53 goals in 58 appearances for the Galaxy over two seasons between 2018 and 2019 before returning to Milan in Serie A. Despite leaving Galaxy empty handed, with the club failing to make the play-offs in 2018 before losing in the Western Conference semi-finals the following year, Ibrahimovic still thinks his impact warrants him the number one position. Ibrahimovic joined the Galaxy in March 2018 after his contract at Manchester United was terminated early. The then 36-year-old had only just returned from a serious knee injury the previous November and says the move across the Atlantic helped him regain full match fitness. ""I'm very happy. I'm very thankful for MLS because they gave me the chance to feel alive.” He told ESPN. “But the problem was I was still too alive. So I was too good for the whole competition. That is what I showed. And I'm the best ever to play in MLS and that is not me having ego or trying to show off now. That is true. ""And when I was there, I enjoyed [it]. I had a good time. And I like the way they were working, the way they were doing the marketing stuff. ""And I think [playing in MLS] was the best way for me to come back after my injury. I was in the best condition ever. And I'm very proud I played for the MLS, because they were saying to me the stadiums are pretty empty when you play in that. ""There was no empty stadiums when I was playing. It was even overbooked, so I cannot complain, and I'm very happy I was there."" Ibrahimovic is still playing at the highest level despite being the age of 40, though injuries have limited him to 24 appearances for Milan in all competitions so far this season. His contract expires in the summer and there had been speculation he could retire - something he emphatically denied earlier this month. When quizzed on his future, the former Sweden striker did not rule out a return to the United States, either as a player or following in David Beckham’s footsteps and buying a franchise of his own. ""You never know - maybe one day I'll come back,"" Ibrahimovic said. ""So to show them how, to give them a reminder what real football is. ""So it's for two years. They get to see what real football is and I think they will never see something like that before. Maybe I come back and have my own club -- you'll never know.""

https://www.goal.com/en/news/when-will-zlatan-ibrahimovic-retire-how-much-longer-play/blt4675886bbf2a52b9,When will Zlatan Ibrahimovic retire & how much longer can he play?,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic burst onto the senior stage at Malmo as a teen in 1999 and, 22 years into a new millennium, the enigmatic Swede is still going strong at 40 years of age. Trophies have been collected by a modern day great on a regular basis over the course of a stunning career that has seen him spend time with the likes of Juventus, Inter, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester United and AC Milan. There will come a day when he has to head into retirement, but when will his boots by hung up and for how much longer could he continue playing at the top level? GOAL takes a look… The self-proclaimed ‘God’ of football has never shied away from the fact that he intends to prolong his career for as long as possible. With a competitive fire burning as bright as ever within an evergreen frontman, there is no need for him to consider walking away from a profession that has made him a living legend. Zlatan at 40.So many iconic moments 😎 pic.twitter.com/yRaFJlFOVV Ibrahimovic has collected league titles in the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and France, while also claiming domestic cup honours in many of his various landing spots – including in England when at Old Trafford. He has registered over 500 goals at club level, with time also spent in the United States with the LA Galaxy, while the target has been found on a record-setting 62 occasions while earning 121 caps for his country. As he has been showing no sign of slowing down, netting 36 times for Milan since rejoining them in December 2019, no fixed date has been set for his retirement. Niggling injuries have started to become more frequent, with knee problems holding him back in 2021-22, and Rossoneri boss Stefano Pioli has said of Ibrahimovic’s future plans as he works on rolling 12-month contracts at San Siro: ""Everyone can have physical problems, he is dealing with a knee issue now. We hope he can return before the end of the season. ""As for his future, I don’t think something has changed. I am sure he will make the best choice, and we’ll back him regardless of what he decides."" Unsurprisingly, Ibrahimovic has responded to suggestions that he may be considering retirement in typically bold fashion, with the Swede posting a video on social media that shows he has lost none of his touch. He said: ""I decide when to stop, just like I decide that the yellow ball will hit you."" I decide when to stop, just like I decide that the yellow ball will hit you pic.twitter.com/481mnOGG2W Having made over 850 appearances on the domestic stage and well over 100 in the international arena, Ibrahimovic could be forgiven for allowing his attention to drift towards what may come next for him. He is, however, someone who has perfected the art of keeping focus locked on the present, and he is not about to change his ways. The veteran forward has admitted that the thought of having to stop playing football does scare him. He has said: ""I do feel a slight sense of panic at the prospect of retirement. ""I will certainly keep playing for as long as possible, as long as I can get results and am not suffering. I want to end my career without regrets, so I have to maximise my time. ""I know the adrenaline I feel at the moment will never be the same. We are programmed to wake up, go to training, return home and rest. ""This goes on for 20-25 years, but one day I will wake up and have nothing planned, and that will be a strange feeling."" HAPPY 40TH BIRTHDAY ZLATAN IBRAHIMOVIC 👑𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐲 𝐧𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐥𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐝 𝐬𝐨 𝐠𝐨𝐨𝐝. pic.twitter.com/rIzXd6HSjt As a proven winner that always demands the highest standards from himself and those him, Ibrahimovic has also been eager to point out that he is reluctant to call it a day before he has helped his current employers to snap a six-year barren run on the trophy front and an 11-year wait for Serie A title glory. He has said: ""I won’t quit until I have won something with this Milan side."" Ibrahimovic has also stated that ""the reality is I’ll play until I see that someone is better than me, so I’m still playing."" He has gone on to say: ""Normally, at 40, you're at home, you light up a cigar and you're satisfied with the career you've had. I’m not ready to smoke a cigar yet."" The world has been warned, Ibrahimovic is going nowhere any time soon and will only walk away on his own terms when there is nothing left for him to achieve. As mentioned, Ibrahimovic has collected trophies and medals just about everywhere he has been - including many individual ones such as Golden Boots and Player of the Year prizes - with his mere presence helping to raise collective standards within any squad he graces. In total he has lifted 33 pieces of silverware, although the two Serie A titles he claimed while with Juventus were later revoked after the Calciopoli scandal.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/police-greenwood-bail-extension-request-await-hearing-man/blt15ae9559e9587820,Police confirm Greenwood bail extension request as they await hearing for Man Utd forward,"Greater Manchester Police have confirmed that an application has been made for the extension of Mason Greenwood’s bail, with the Manchester United forward arrested in January on suspicion of rape, assault and threats to kill. The 20-year-old was first taken into custody on January 30 following the release of images and video online by a woman reporting incidents of physical violence. He was released on bail on February 4, with United having already taken the decision by that point to suspend him “until further notice”. Investigations remain ongoing and it has now been revealed that Greenwood’s bail will be extended beyond April 30. A statement from the police reads: ""We are continuing to investigate a report made to us on Sunday 30 January of online social media images and videos posted by a woman reporting incidents of physical violence. A 20-year-old man arrested that day on suspicion of the rape and assault of a woman, and threats to kill, remains on bail. ""An application has been made to the courts to have his bail extended beyond Saturday 30 April, but the hearing isn't expected to be until mid-June. The suspect will remain on conditional bail until the date of the court hearing."" The hearing in question will not be held until the middle of June. Greenwood has not figured for United since a Premier League meeting with West Ham on January 22. As well as being suspended indefinitely at Old Trafford, Greenwood has also seen Nike cancel all commercial partnerships with him. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-fantastic-human-being-dalot-man-utd-ten-hag/blt633e6bb585f178b9,'Ronaldo is a fantastic human being' - Dalot hails Portugal star's impact at Man Utd and welcomes Ten Hag clarity,"Diogo Dalot has revealed the impact Cristiano Ronaldo has had in the Manchester United dressing room this season, while also hailing the club's appointment of Erik ten Hag, who he describes as a ""great manager"". Man Utd brought Ronaldo back to the club from Juventus in a £20 million ($25m) deal last summer, 13 years from his initial departure to Real Madrid. The 37-year-old has since been the Red Devils' main source of goals, netting 23 across all competitions in the 2021-22 campaign, and Dalot says he is also a great source of inspiration behind the scenes at Old Trafford. Speaking ahead of Man Utd's next Premier League game, against Brentford, the Portuguese defender told Sky Sports of Ronaldo: ""I'm sure I speak not just for me but he's been one of the most positive things about this season - to work with somebody who has his culture of working, his professionalism, his mentality and being close to him now, it's been very helpful for me and my career. ""I don't have any more compliments to give about the way he works, he's a fantastic human being as well. The numbers are there, the stats are there, so we're obviously very happy to have him here."" Dalot added on how the rest of the squad gets on with Ronaldo: ""He's a very friendly person. When he feels he has the trust of other people, he gives 100 per cent of himself to you. ""Everybody gets along with him here, everyone likes to have him around. It's always a big plus to have a player and a person like this in the changing room."" Dalot went on to discuss the appointment of Ten Hag, who will replace Ralf Rangnick in the Old Trafford dugout at the end of his final season with Ajax. The full-back is glad the squad has the clarity of a permanent boss to work with after Rangnick's six-month interim spell in charge, and feels Ten Hag has all the qualities to be successful in Manchester. ""I don't think you need to see a lot to know that he is a great manager - what he's done with Ajax is something outstanding,"" said Dalot. ""He plays very attractive football, I think every fan of United is excited to have a manager like this, and we as the players are as well. ""In our heads, it's going to be clear who the manager will be next season and that's good because we go for our break in our heads knowing who to expect. ""Then we will have time in pre-season to work together, get our ideas right and start the new season."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

""I'm pretty sure he's got my phone number!"" the Manchester United interim manager tells Sky Sports, standing within the inner confines of a silent Old Trafford late on Thursday evening. ""He's got another couple of games to play with Ajax, we have another three games to play here. Whenever he wants to speak with me and exchange our opinions, I'm more than happy to do that."" Erik ten Hag was appointed more than a week ago as the man to drive United into a new era, one where they're expected to be back challenging for the Premier League title and major trophies, and one which is still to even make the first tentative steps. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It is scarcely believable that nearly 10 years and four permanent managers have passed since Sir Alex Ferguson announced his retirement - the last time United were English football's top dogs. Right now, they are further away than ever from experiencing the same past glories - set to finish this season with their lowest-ever Premier League points total. But Rangnick, despite admitting the club needs ""open heart surgery"", is upbeat the process to get back to the summit might not take long, providing the right changes are made. ""Knowing Erik will be the manager, with a good recruitment process and bringing in the right players, I'm very positive the supporters and the media will be able to see a better team and, at the end, hopefully a better position in the league,"" he said. Man Utd fixtures Premier League table Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments ""There are quite a few good examples in the league with when Jurgen Klopp came to Liverpool, Pep Guardiola to Manchester City, Thomas Tuchel came to Chelsea - yes, he came in the middle of the season and inherited a top-quality squad, but you still need to win the Champions League. ""If you know what you're looking for, the profiles of the different positions you need, it shouldn't hopefully take too long."" That is where Rangnick will lend his expertise during his two-year consultancy role while managing the Austria national team. The 63-year-old was not prepared to discuss his new job or how both would be combined going forwards - and would neither offer an opinion on whether Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored eight of the team's last 9 league goals, could fit into Ten Hag's demanding style of play. ""This is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag,"" he said, after Ronaldo rescued United again on Thursday night by scoring the equaliser in their 1-1 with Chelsea. ""He's showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it's obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, it's pretty obvious."" Rangnick wants United to find and develop ""future top, star players"" who can be moulded into the club's ways rather than buying a player who is already the finished product, as they have been keen to do in recent years. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The interim boss believes combining that approach with consistent recruitment at each opportunity can, again, move United closer to the country's top teams. ""If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window,"" he said. ""They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. ""I wouldn't be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks. This shows it is possible that this can happen and it would not necessarily need three, four years in order to do that."" Ironically, United face Brentford on Monday Night Football, live on Sky Sports, a club renowned for their work in the transfer market. The Bees have reached the top-flight with their Moneyball-style use of data to drive their player recruitment - making only four signings last summer to help comfortably keep them in the Premier League for a second season. Rangnick rightly points out the difference in size between United and Brentford, which has to be taken into consideration when the two are signing players and their approach to it, but agrees every club needs to follow an 'idea'. ""No matter which club, it is always necessary and important that you need an idea,"" he said. ""You need to know how you want to play, what kind of profiles do we need because if you do not do that, you're always looking for the needle in the haystack. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""This is what I meant when I said 'open heart surgery'. I don't think it's enough to do some minor corrections and amendments. I think it's important to see the big picture and then hopefully bring in the best possible players. ""They should also fit together, this is also an issue, it is not only about bringing some players for defence, midfield and up front, it's also important you get to know the personality of the players and that they really fit and are able to meet the standards of this big club."" In the meantime, as United prepare to play their final home game of the season, Rangnick will keep on waiting to share his ideas with the man responsible for rebuilding United.

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/12582098/erik-ten-hag-manchester-united-appoint-ajax-boss-as-new-manager,Erik ten Hag: Manchester United appoint Ajax boss as new manager,"Manchester United have appointed Ajax boss Erik ten Hag as their new manager, to replace interim Ralf Rangnick at the end of the season. Sky Sports News reported on March 31 Ten Hag was in pole position to land the job over Mauricio Pochettino, with sources close to the manager and Ajax revealing compensation is below £2m. The 52-year-old has signed a three-year deal with the option of a further 12 months. He told United's website: ""It is a great honour to be appointed manager of Manchester United and I am hugely excited by the challenge ahead. ""I know the history of this great club and the passion of the fans, and I am absolutely determined to develop a team capable of delivering the success they deserve. ""It will be difficult to leave Ajax after these incredible years, and I can assure our fans of my complete commitment and focus on bringing this season to a successful conclusion before I move to Manchester United."" Mitchell van der Gaag, Ten Hag's assistant at Ajax, is likely to join him at Old Trafford with advanced negotiations already under way. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Edwin van der Sar, Ajax's chief executive and a former United goalkeeper, said, ""we would have liked to have kept Erik for longer"", but added, ""he is going to make the step to one of the biggest clubs in the world"". VOTE: Who should stay or leave Man Utd this summer? Why the scale of Man Utd rebuild is frightening Man Utd exodus: 18 players who could leave this summer Ten Hag Q&A: Carra's verdict on incoming Man Utd boss Ten Hag told Ajax's website: ""I'm happy that it has been finalised and that it has been officially announced. That clarity is important."" John Murtough, United's football director, said: ""During the past four years at Ajax, Erik has proved himself to be one of the most exciting and successful coaches in Europe, renowned for his team's attractive, attacking football and commitment to youth. ""In our conversations with Erik leading up to this appointment, we were deeply impressed with his long-term vision for returning Manchester United to the level we want to be competing at, and his drive and determination to achieve that. ""We wish Erik the best of luck as he focuses on achieving a successful end to the season at Ajax and look forward to welcoming him to Manchester United this summer."" Ten Hag was understood to be the unanimous choice at United following a rigorous recruitment process that was led by Murtough and Darren Fletcher, the technical director. Richard Arnold, the executive vice-chairman, was also involved and the trio are understood to have agreed Ten Hag was the best candidate for the job. Mauricio Pochettino, the Paris Saint-Germain manager who previously coached Tottenham and Southampton, and Julen Lopetegui, the Sevilla boss, were also interviewed by United, but the club are believed to have felt the Dutchman was the one that most closely aligned with their plans for the future. Pochettino and Lopetegui are understood to have interviewed well, while Luis Enrique was also considered until it quickly became apparent he was committed to Spain ahead of this year's World Cup. United were looking for a number of attributes from their new manager, including proven success, a commitment to youth, the ability to improve players and the will to introduce an attractive style of play. Ten Hag is said to have set out his long-term vision to build a successful and exciting team during conversations with United, in which he is also said to have shown enthusiasm for the challenge he now faces at Old Trafford. Sky Sports News understands Ten Hag will tell United players he does not want any passengers at the club. His key message to them will be that he is the manager, there is a new regime and United are going to go back to playing like Manchester United. If there are any players who are not up for the challenge, they are welcome to leave, but everyone will start with a clean slate. He has not been given any specific targets, but he knows his job is to make United great again. Ten Hag also wants Steve McClaren to return to United and talks about making that happen are ongoing. The good relationship between United and Ajax helped smooth the process to appoint Ten Hag. It is believed potential negotiations with PSG, had United opted for Pochettino, would have proved more problematic. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ten Hag will be United's fifth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. The club have won only three trophies in the following nine years - the FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League - while they are currently in danger of missing out on qualification for the Champions League next season. Ten Hag is set to oversee a much-needed rebuild at United, with Rangnick - who is due to take up a consultancy role at Old Trafford this summer - saying after the 4-0 thrashing at rivals Liverpool on Tuesday that the side may need up to 10 new players. A number of first-team players, including Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard and Edinson Cavani, could be set to leave as part of the overhaul, with their contracts expiring at the end of the season. On Wednesday, the departures of Jim Lawlor, United's chief scout, and Marcel Bout, the head of global scouting, were announced. Ralf Rangnick said Manchester United need to sign as many as 10 new players after their 4-0 thrashing by Liverpool on Tuesday night, but which players could leave in their rebuild? Man Utd are currently sixth in the Premier League, three points off the top four but having played a game more than both Tottenham (fourth) and Arsenal (fifth). Will they squeeze into the top four? Here are their remaining fixtures... Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports News' senior reporter Melissa Reddy: ""Manchester United's interest in Erik ten Hag came as no surprise given his status as one of the most progressive coaches in Europe, and his long links to their managerial vacancy. ""The 52-year-old has had admirers at Old Trafford stretching back to 2018/19, when his Ajax side knocked out Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, before then stunning Juventus and only being denied a place in the final after Lucas Moura's last-minute goal for Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham. ""Ten Hag is a popular choice to take charge at Old Trafford and represents what is seen as a ""fresh, exciting future"", although there is an acceptance risk is involved as it is a sizeable leap for him. ""The last highly-successful Ajax coach to move to England's top flight - via Inter - was Frank de Boer, who lasted just 77 days at Crystal Palace. ""The expectations, global glare placed on United, and level of competition at the top end of the Premier League is like nothing he would have previously experienced."" Kaveh Solhekol, Sky Sports' chief reporter: ""The timing is not ideal if you are an Ajax supporter as they are in a race to win the Dutch title, but when Man Utd came calling, Erik ten Hag really could not turn down the club. ""It suits Man Utd to make this statement today for a variety of reasons: from a PR point of view, everybody connected with Man Utd wants some good news at the moment and also, it makes it clear what is happening at Man Utd over the next few months. There is clarity now - all the players who are thinking of leaving, or who Man Utd want to sign, know Ten Hag is going to be the new manager. ""He is also going to have the whole of the summer and pre-season with the players, so that is perfect preparation as far as he is concerned. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I also think it is very significant he is being called the manager - we know one of the things he has been asking for is to be in control of everything. He does not just want to be a head coach - he wants to have control over the transfer strategy and recruitment as well. ""I think Man Utd have made a lot of mistakes when it has come to appointing managers since Sir Alex Ferguson left, but this time round they think they have the right man and obviously he has a big, big job to do. ""But people need to retain a sense of perspective as well - I know the team are not playing as well or in the kind of way a Man Utd team should be playing. But let's not forget, less than 12 months ago, Man Utd finished second in the Premier League, they finished above Liverpool and over the past decade, six of the last 10 seasons they have finished above Liverpool. ""Man Utd are still a massive, massive club - one of the biggest clubs in the world. There are obviously still issues with the ownership structure, the way the club is run, but the big problem is they have not had the right manager in charge, and when they have had the right man, they have not given that manager enough time. ""This time round, when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer lost his job five months ago, we told you the replacement was going to be either Mauricio Pochettino or Erik ten Hag. I know a lot of people would have preferred Pochettino as he had Premier League experience with Southampton and Spurs, so it is a bit of a risk going for Ten Hag. ""Yes, he has done very well in Holland, but he has been managing the biggest club in Holland, he does not have any Premier League experience, but United have spoken to various candidates, they have interviewed Ten Hag, they interviewed Pochettino as well, and they have decided to go for Ten Hag. From United's point of view, it is great they have been able to get Ten Hag and announce it so quickly."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Gary Neville speaking on The Overlap in March: ""Ten Hag worked in Bayern Munich when Pep Guardiola was there. We know the impact that had. He's won a couple of titles and cups in Holland. His style of play is good. He's got more experience than I think most people think at the age of 52.

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/12599944/where-could-each-premier-league-team-finish,Premier League clubs' best and worst possible final positions in table,"Manchester City and Liverpool are locked in a two-horse race for the Premier League title - but how high or low could your club finish this season? Clubs have between two and five games left to seal their fate but 19 out of 20 clubs are still challenging for the title, qualification for the Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League, or to avoid the drop. Data guru Ben Mayhew has calculated each club's range of possible final league positions and found only Norwich have nothing to play for besides pride during the remainder of this season. Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United are all in the hunt to join title-tussling Manchester City and Liverpool in the top four - with Spurs and United potentially slipping as low as eighth to miss out on Europe next season altogether. With seventh spot being the lowest position to potentially offer a European berth, if permutations play out across competitions, it means all teams from fifth to 13th-placed Aston Villa retain the potential to qualify for Europe. Norwich were relegated on Saturday after a 2-0 defeat to Villa and results conspired against them elsewhere, but, theoretically, every single team sitting above the Canaries up to ninth-placed Brighton could finish in the drop zone. Watford have been widely written off in the survival race but the Hornets could still finish in 16th, while the attention for that final relegation spot centres on Everton, Leeds and Burnley - but all three could still secure a top-half finish. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Premier League fixtures Mayhew has also simulated every possible result from the remaining games and calculated the probabilities of each club's possible final positions. The results suggest Manchester City have a 69-per-cent chance of retaining their Premier League crown, while Liverpool have almost the same chance of finishing as runners-up. Chelsea are nailed down for third spot at 93 per cent, with Arsenal pipping Tottenham to the final Champions League berth at 74 per cent - while Manchester United have a whopping 94-per-cent-chance of finishing in their current sixth spot. Each club’s attacking and defensive strength have been rated using an expected goals model, which measures the quality of chances they create and allow.  These ratings were then used to simulate the rest of the season 10,000 times to measure the probability of each club finishing in each league position. Further down the table - between Brighton and Southampton - things become far less predictable, with fairly even spreads between ninth and 15th. The probabilities consign Watford to the Championship but the pressure ramps up for the final drop spot, with Leeds favourites to finish in 18th (46 per cent), followed by Everton (31 per cent) and Burnley (23 per cent).

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/12579011/liverpool-further-in-quadruple-bid-than-any-english-club-in-history,Liverpool's Quadruple quest: How do Jurgen Klopp's side fare in historic bid?,"Liverpool's quest for an historic Quadruple continues when they travel to Villarreal for the second leg of their Champions League semi-final on Tuesday night, with the Reds' bid having now gone further into a season than any other English side before them. Jurgen Klopp's team head to Spain leading 2-0 as they look to progress to the final of Europe's premier club competition in Paris on May 28 against either Man City or Real Madrid. However, even if Liverpool fail to make it to the French capital, they have still managed to surpass the Chelsea side of 2006/07, whose own Quadruple challenge lasted all the way until May 1 of that campaign before losing to Liverpool in the Champions League semi-finals. And if Liverpool do manage to see off Villarreal on Tuesday, their next leg of the Quadruple will come against Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley on May 14, a repeat of this season's League Cup final, which the Reds won on penalties in February. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, in the race for the Premier League, Liverpool still just a point behind City as we enter the final four games of the season after an impressive unbeaten run in the league saw the champions' seemingly unsurmountable 14-point lead on January 15 evaporate. In total, Liverpool could face a gruelling seven-match schedule in May if they make it through to the final of European Cup at the Stade de France. So, how have other English teams got on when faced with such a daunting challenge, while surely the trophy-laden Liverpool sides of the 80s must have gone close to achieving the feat? And what about some of the great European giants of years gone by? Liverpool fixtures Premier League table As is surely common knowledge by now, no English team has ever won the Quadruple. Prior to this season, the closest any top-flight side had ever got to winning all four major trophies in a single campaign was Chelsea back in 2006/07. Heading into May of that season, Jose Mourinho's back-to-back Premier League champions had already landed the League Cup after beating Arsenal 2-1 at the Millennium Stadium, while they had an FA Cup final date to look forward to with Manchester United, who they were also going toe to toe with in the league. However, the Blues' challenge ended when they lost on penalties to Liverpool at Anfield in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final, while they would also go on to lose their title to United. Manchester United also came close to making history in 2008/09, only to slip up in the semi-finals of the FA Cup when losing 4-2 on penalties to Everton, although they did then get beaten 2-0 by Barcelona in that season's Champions League final in Rome. And, of course, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side have had numerous Quadruple bids as well since the Catalan arrived at the Etihad, the closest being in 2018/19 and last season. However, the former challenge was ended by Tottenham in the Champions League last eight and the latter after a defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals. Liverpool's current quest, though, will last at least until May 3, when the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with Villarreal concludes, meaning their Quadruple campaign will have lasted longer than any other English team's in history. And before you ask, Manchester United's famous Treble-winning season of 1998/99 actually included a League Cup quarter-final loss at Spurs in the December of that campaign. You would have thought Liverpool have come close before, but actually they have not, despite winning the League Cup four years in a row from 1981. It was the FA Cup that ultimately proved to be Liverpool's Achilles' heel in each of those four campaigns, with the Reds never managing to make it past the fifth round, meaning the closest they came was in 1982/83, only for a shock 2-1 home defeat to second division Brighton to end their Quadruple dreams in February. And it was Brighton again in the cup who scuppered the Reds' chances of winning all four trophies in their Treble-winning campaign the following season. Oddly enough, despite Klopp's 'Mentality Monsters' barely losing a game between 2018 and 2020, they never actually came close to winning the Quadruple. In fact, the nearest they came to achieving the feat was in their title-winning campaign of 2019/20, only for a youth side - selected because of a fixture clash with the Club World Cup - to lose 5-0 at Aston Villa in the League Cup quarter-finals to put an end that dream. In the first season in England when four trophies were up for grabs in 1960/61, it was Burnley who came closest before losing to Hamburg in the last eight of the European Cup in March 1961. However, Celtic did manage to accomplish the seemingly impossible in 1966-67 when Jock Stein's 'Lisbon Lions' won it all - the Scottish First Division, League Cup and Scottish Cup, followed by the first European Cup won by a British team after victory over Inter Milan. Well, the first thing to point out here is that up until the 2019-20 season, France, as in England, was the only other country in Europe's top-five major leagues to have an extra cup competition in the form of the League Cup, or Coupe de la Ligue. So that explains why European giants like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus have all never previously won the Quadruple. Paris Saint-Germain did, though, recently come within a whisker of pulling it off under Thomas Tuchel, only to fall agonisingly at the final hurdle. The big-spending Parisians were awarded that season's Ligue 1 title in April based on a points-per-game ratio after the campaign was prematurely curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when the season did eventually resume, PSG beat St Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final on July 24, before edging out Lyon 6-5 on penalties to claim the Coupe de la Ligue the following weekend. Then, when the Champions League also returned in August, Tuchel's team made it all the way to the final for the first time in the club's history, before unluckily losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. All of which shows just what a mountain Klopp and Co still face in order to make history this season...

United stopped talk of a potential walk-out demonstration by beating Brentford 3-0 in Rangnick's final home game as interim manager. Old Trafford had a feel-good environment for the game after a wretched season as it closed its doors for the summer with farewells to a host of first-team players who are out of contract. Nemanja Matic, Juan Mata, Phil Jones and Edinson Cavani in all probability made their final Old Trafford appearances, while Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard are also out of contract in the summer. Rangnick told Sky Sports: ""Apart from goalkeeping where we have three excellent goalkeepers in Tom Heaton, Dean Henderson and David de Gea, in all other areas there will be players leaving the club. I wouldn't put focus on special areas of the pitch - it should go through the whole team.

""Other clubs only needed two or three transfer windows to challenge but from now on we need to bring in top-quality players who really help raise the level. If this happens then I don't think it should take too long."" Man Utd 3-0 Brentford - Match report Get Sky Sports Premier League table Premier League fixtures Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  One of the first players Erik ten Hag will need to talk to surrounding the future will be Cristiano Ronaldo, who has now scored nine of United's last 12 goals in the Premier League with a penalty in the 3-0 win. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner won the man-of-the-match award from Sky Sports co-commentator Gary Neville. Ronaldo's future has been cast into doubt due to United's likely failure to qualify for the Champions League, but his current deal runs until the summer of 2023. Rangnick believes if Ronaldo stays next season, he will need support in central striking positions as the player himself isn't fully comfortable at his age playing in the lone striking role. He said: ""Cristiano is not a central striker. He does not want to play in that position, in order to not play central, you have to play two strikers. If you look into international football, there are not many teams who play with two, you either have three or a false nine. It's not a question of a position, the club needs two new strikers who give this team more quality. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Modern strikers do not have to be wingers if you look at Liverpool and Man City, they have top strikers. Gabriel Jesus has hardly played and now he's playing regularly. If you ask me if he's a central striker or a winger, is Grealish a striker, they can switch and rotate. We don't have that many. Mason Greenwood would have been those players, but he's no longer part of the squad. Martial went on loan at Seville, Cavani has been injured."" United were pretty comfortable against Brentford and - with Ronaldo at the forefront - looked fluid and creative in attack. The result looks to have almost guaranteed their qualification for the Europa League next term by finishing sixth or higher - instead of playing in the Europa Conference League. ""In the end I'm not happy with the results [overall], especially in the last four or five weeks,"" Rangnick added. ""Until the West Ham game we were still in the race in three competitions. We had good moments until that West Ham game, we conceded fewer goals but in the last few weeks performances have not been as good as they should have been. In general we have lacked consistency.""

Gary Neville threw that question to his colleagues in the studio during Monday Night Football as Jamie Carragher and Roy Keane discussed the ""catastrophic fall"" and how long it might take Erik ten Hag to turn the club around. ""It is a question really for the lads, I have been asked it a few times and said that I haven't got a clue what has gone wrong really at Manchester United this season. The first task for me really is to find out what has gone wrong. ""Why has this catastrophic fall occurred? ""Why has this team that finished second last season, 10 to 12 points behind City, found themselves where they are? I still can't put my finger on that. Surely that is something that Ten Hag has to deal with first and foremost?"" Carragher pointed to the noises coming out of the dressing room. ""I think it is really interesting hearing stories about how toxic the dressing room is. Under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, there was something about Manchester United. They were nowhere near as good as Liverpool or City, but they looked like decent lads, a decent group.

""Whatever about the talent and the board room and who the manager is, you have to have a decent dressing room, decent personalities, decent characters.

Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho were signed last summer with many expecting to see an improvement. Instead, the opposite happened. Was their arrival part of the problem, perhaps? ""That is the only thing you can point to,"" said Neville. ""You can point towards Ole reaching his height and they could not go any further and they got, not sick of the message, but it had become stale and they did not believe he could overtake Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola. ""Or something had disrupted that changing room. They had put the wrong ingredient into the dish and it has made it completely go sour. That is the bit that has to be dealt with because these players are not as bad as the points tally that is on that board. ""They are better than that. There is something deeper that is wrong in that dressing room that is making them play the way they are and get the results they are getting."" The task ahead of Ten Hag is not just to climb the table but ultimately to close what has become a vast gap to the teams chasing the Premier League title. For the third season in four, United are likely to finish more than 25 points behind the champions. Perusing the list of deficits since Sir Alex Ferguson last delivered the title in 2013, Keane stressed that the quality of the opposition is a big problem for United. ""It is ugly, that,"" said Keane. ""Whatever way you look at it, it is not good. We know it is a long way back for Manchester United but of course there is a way back. Maybe the new manager coming is a good time because I always think, you cannot get any worse. ""It is the points tally that worries me because they are so far behind. Even last season Ole finishing second and you're thinking he's doing well, there is such a big gap. The biggest problem for Manchester United is where Manchester City are, where Liverpool are. ""We talk about Manchester United rebuilding as if Liverpool and Manchester City are going to take it easy over the summer. They are going to invest, they are going to get players in, they are going to get stronger. Klopp is staying on, Pep might stay on. ""When he comes in they have to get the recruitment right, he has to get players in and the right players through the door because the last few years just have not been good enough. ""The biggest disappointment for me when they have had these disappointments is the reaction. I don't think they have shown the leadership. Whatever about talent, there are not enough characters in that dressing room."" Could the example of Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool provide the template for Ten Hag in terms of expectations and the timeframe in which the new man might have United challenging again? Carragher believes so. ""I think it is very similar, it really is,"" he explained. ""I think it was possibly a harder job for Jurgen Klopp because the funds are there for the next Manchester United manager. We have seen that over the last 10 years and going forward will be a lot more than what Klopp had when he first came in. ""People talk about how long it should take Ten Hag or any top manager at a top club. There is talk of Liverpool and Manchester City possibly being five years ahead, I have even heard 10 years ahead of Manchester United. I think it is rubbish, I really do. ""I think a top manager gets a top club back on track in a couple of years. That is not to say winning the title or the Champions League but they get them back on track where they are competing. ""Liverpool came in November and they finished eighth in his first season. In some ways it would probably be better for United if they finished eighth and there was no European football. ""But they still reached a Europa League final, beat Manchester United on the way, some top teams, Villarreal, Borussia Dortmund, you thought there was something happening.  ""In that second season, the first full season, he got Champions League. That has to be what Manchester United get next season under Ten Hag. He has to. ""Liverpool were back on track in that third season. All great clubs should be judged on the Premier League and the Champions League. Not necessarily winning it but in with a shout. ""That is where Liverpool come in, they were Champions League runners-up in season three. They go on to win it and then win the Premier League but they are back at the party in year three. That is why I think the talk of five years or more is a nonsense."" Neville rejects the idea that Klopp had it harder than Ten Hag. ""I don't think so. Jurgen Klopp has done the most outrageous job at Liverpool, it has been outstanding. But there were no real set winners at that time when he came in. ""I would liken the job that Ten Hag has coming in and taking on these two outstanding managers who have set foundations at their clubs for five years more like Gerard Houllier's job when he came in and Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger were set. ""You are coming in when there are two or three managers - because I could put Thomas Tuchel in there as well - are set in their jobs and have that foundation. I think the job that Ten Hag has is absolutely huge."" But Neville accepts the timeframe suggested by Carragher. ""I don't disagree with Jamie's timeline of Champions League [qualification] in the first two seasons while he is sorting the recruitment out and getting used to the club. Third season getting very close to the point where the club has confidence and winning a trophy maybe. ""And that fourth year and fifth year is where you want to be winning a title, that is what we are looking at realistically. We would all hope he comes in and blows everyone away and Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola blow up somehow. But they are not blowing up are they?"" Even so, Keane thinks Ten Hag will back himself to have a big impact. ""Any top coach would come in with a bit of an ego and believe they can make a difference - certainly to this group,"" said Keane. ""They can't get any worse next season, surely? They can maybe win a cup or whatever and rebuild the club. ""Any top manager will believe he can get a reaction from the players and he will get backing. It might take a couple of windows but a good manager will believe that he can turn things around pretty quickly. Not in terms of winning trophies, but competing. ""The fans and the club have to get confidence in this new manager. Over the last few years, there have been doubts about Mourinho's style, Van Gaal, David Moyes, Ole. When he comes in, he needs proper support and that power he deserves to get.""

In a press conference by the Austrian FA, Rangnick was appointed the new national team manager until 2024, with a clause inserted into the contract which states that the deal will be renewed for another two years if the country qualifies for Euro 2024. Rangnick was quoted by the Austrian FA website as saying: ""It's an honour for me to take on the role of team boss. I'm particularly excited about the prospect of contesting the European Championships in Germany with a young team hungry for success."" The 63-year-old replaced Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at United at the end of November, agreeing to take temporary charge of the team until the summer, before remaining in a consultancy role. However, results have been disappointing under Rangnick, with United currently sixth in the Premier League, five points behind Arsenal in the fourth and final Champions League spot for next season as the campaign draws to a close. Ajax manager Erik ten Hag was recently announced as United's permanent boss for next season, although Rangnick will, as planned, still stay on as a consultant. That role will encompass six days a month for the next two years, meaning the German would be able to combine the work with his Austria duties. ""I'm very much looking forward to it,"" said Rangnick, when asked about his United consultancy role. ""We haven't spoken, Erik and myself, we've spoken with the board about the contract and the profile of the job, the content of the consultancy role.""

""The Austrian national team have got pride, it's a great country with great players, so he'll have to watch them play every week.

Man United can't afford to have distractions at this moment in time, they can't afford to have a poor communications plan around the idea that Rangnick's the football consultant, but he's seen watching German football three times a month and then going off to coach the Austrian team.

Ronaldo moved level with Heung-min Son in joint second in the Premier League goalscoring charts with his 17th of the season on Thursday, earning United a 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Thursday evening with what was his fifth strike in his last three games for the club. The 37-year-old has scored eight of United's last nine goals, including match-winning hat-tricks against Tottenham and Norwich, in an emphatic response to criticism that came his way earlier in the season during a run of one goal in 10 games. Neville and Keane both highlighted Ronaldo's ill fit for Ten Hag's high-pressing style, but said the five-time Ballon D'Or winner's sheer quality meant he should have a chance to see out the second of his two-year contract at Old Trafford. Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, Neville said: ""He lifts the fans, he gets them on the edge of their seats, takes his chances, and it'll be really interesting to see what happens with Erik Ten Hag. ""We knows he plays with an aggressive press, he tries to win the ball high up the pitch, that isn't Cristiano's strong point and we know that. But he will want a goalscorer. He will want someone who can put the ball in the back of the net 20 or 25 times. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""Can Manchester United use him as a bridge next season to get them through Erik Ten Hag's first season? Ronaldo is a phenomenon. He's achieved everything and more in the game, his professionalism is beyond anything you could ever wish for, really.

You can't speak highly enough of him, his goal tonight was wonderful and he doesn't really lose that belief in himself when the rest of the team is really lacking in confidence - his is still there. ""He's a sensation, an absolute sensation. I talked about the attitude of the players in the first half and I wasn't really talking about him, he's proven over a long period of time and what he's doing, the shape of his body and the recovery from the tragedy only last week to still perform, to get back on the bike and go when he could've easily said he was staying off for a few weeks. In a poor season for United he's been a bright light in some ways."" Keane highlighted Ronaldo's mastery of ""the hardest part of the game"" - scoring goals: he has scored 20 times in 12 consecutive league seasons, with the possibility to make that 13 in the final three matches of this campaign. And the former United captain said the bit-part defensive role some former strikers, including Eric Cantona and Ruud Van Nistelrooy, had played during his time at the club shows how Ten Hag could build a pressing team around Ronaldo during his first season at the helm. Keane told Sky Sports: ""I know people are quick to criticise what [Ronaldo] doesn't do, in terms of his pressing, but he was never great at that anyway. He's the greatest at the hardest part of the game - putting the ball in the back of the net. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""That was his only chance tonight. Look at the chances Chelsea were creating; imagine if he'd been in the Chelsea team - he'd probably get 50 goals. ""Ten Hag will be having a sleepless night watching the team, but if you've got a player in the group who can score that amount of goals, they have to be involved. He'll want to play week-in, week-out, the new manager will come in and will be looking for another striker but Ronaldo's not hanging around unless he's playing. ""That's his biggest challenge, working with these personalities. As brilliant as they are, he has to get a team who can compete. And if that's winning the ball back high and pressing, Ronaldo is not good at that. But I still think you can have him in your team and have other players who can do that. ""Cantona, Van Nistelrooy wouldn't be great at chasing the ball back for you, but we had enough lads in the team who could win it. People say you need all your players to press, but you can get away with it with one player, and as long as they're producing the goods you'll forgive them."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking after Ronaldo's latest point-winning goal involvement, interim manager Ralf Rangnick said Manchester United have become reliant on the Portuguese forward, and will have to invest in that department when the transfer window opens. ""Yes, right now we very much rely on Cristiano,"" he said at the press conference following the Chelsea draw. ""He also showed a good performance when Chelsea were in possession, he helped out a lot in the second half defensively. ""There has to be a focus on bringing in a couple of new strikers, this is for sure."" Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

The 63-year-old is set to fail in his objective of leading the stuttering club to Champions League qualification but still hopes to leave a lasting legacy at Old Trafford. Rangnick will switch from United's interim boss to a consultancy role in the summer - a job that will run in tandem with his new position as manager of Austria's national team. The German has an impressive track record of developing teams, recently succeeding with RB Leipzig and sister club RB Salzburg, and believes transfers are key to providing incoming boss Erik ten Hag that platform to succeed. ""For me, the most important bit is recruitment now,"" Rangnick said when asked what he will be advising on. ""This is, for me, the most vital point, that we bring in the best possible players and speak about that, who could that be. ""It's not only identifying those players but meeting them, convincing them to join this club, even though we will not be playing in the Champions League. Get Sky Sports Premier League table Man Utd fixtures Transfer Centre LIVE! ""This is what I see as the most important bit. Again, also, with regard to top talented players for the academy, identifying those kind of players."" Asked if United can go back to buying players at the peak of their powers, Rangnick said: ""My personal opinion is that the club should try to find future top star players and develop them. ""Again, on the other hand, just tell me five players that might be some of those players that you spoke about."" When Haaland and Kylan Mbappe were reeled off, Rangnick said: ""Haaland is a young player. He's 21 or 22. This is one of those players I spoke about. ""But, on the other hand, he has developed in the last two years into one of probably the most expensive strikers in the world. ""But, yes, he could be, he would be one of those examples where I think the focus should be on to try and identify and find and then convince players who could be Manchester United players for the next couple of years."" Rangnick believes United's support, stadium and training facilities still make them an attractive proposition irrespective of Champions League qualification. But that view also comes with a dose of realism given rivals Manchester City and Liverpool are flying high, with the club targeting the ""full package"" of ""mentality, quality, physicality, pace, skills"" in new players. Rangnick says it is obvious that the team need additions given their struggles and departing players, with Monday's match against Brentford looking to be an Old Trafford farewell for out-of-contract Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic. ""I would like to (play them) but it's also about getting the best possible result and the best possible performance,"" he said. ""It's not about making any gifts to players. ""Juan Mata played the last 15 minutes, Nema almost the whole game, so it's not about saying farewell to the supporters. ""If that is possible I would do that or I would like to do that, but it's also about getting the best possible result."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Rangnick hopes to have Fred back for Monday's match and captain Harry Maguire may return, while Edinson Cavani - another out of contract in the summer - was due to return to training on Friday. But the 63-year-old says Jadon Sancho will be absent against Brentford and ""might be out for the rest of the season with his tonsillitis"". Asked if Sancho was having his tonsils out, Rangnick added: ""It could happen. ""He's definitely got an inflammation on his tonsils and has also had some high temperatures, so that's why he was not available (against Chelsea) and he will most certainly not be available for the next two games. ""Hopefully, they can get hold of that inflammation and then hopefully if the tonsils have to be taken out and removed this can happen at the end of the season.""

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11748/12187923/how-brentfords-transfer-strategy-has-been-altered-by-brexit,How Brentford's transfer strategy has been altered by Brexit,"Brentford have become renowned for spotting, signing and developing players from the lower divisions ofEurope. Their philosophy of bringing them in for modest fees and selling on for tens of millions, from the UK and the continent, as better players has helped establish them as promotion contenders to the Premier League. But under the new work permit rules brought in as a result of Brexit, several of their biggest success stories would not have been possible. Neal Maupay, for example, who was bought for £1.8m from Saint-Etienne and sold to Brighton for £20m, would not have reached the new 15-point threshold, and neither would Said Benrahma, who was signed for £1.5m is worth £25m in his current loan to West Ham. So what do the new rules mean for Brentford's recruitment strategy? Will they have to change tact? And does it put into jeopardy their long-term progress? The changes have impacted Brentford's strategy, and probably the most tangible is on the amount of talent they have to scout and choose targets from; it will be greatly reduced. They have a sizeable scouting network that has been covering most of Europe, including the lower reaches of France and Germany, but much of this work is now redundant. So the club are working on an automated system that will instantly flag whether a player would gain a work permit or not before he is watched, which will reduce the scouting pool from the thousands to the hundreds, and this is seen as a positive by recruitment staff. Despite a smaller list, the club feel there will still be enough talent on the continent for them, but expect to face more competition and may need to pay more than they have done before to get them. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines January transfer window 2021: All you need to know Premier League ins and outs On their side is that the club have grown in stature since the signings of Maupay and Benrahma in 2017 and 2018, and can attract players ready for the top level of the Championship immediately; which is what they need. They have also recouped significant funds from player sales to be able to afford them, notably Ollie Watkins to Aston Villa for £33m. This has allowed them to invest as much as £10m in Ivan Toney from Peterborough, for example; a player that really has hit the ground running. This is the kind of signing fans should expect to see more of. One shift the Bees will make is to focus even more on talent coming from the lower leagues in the UK than they have done already. Brentford would be keen to give homegrown players a clearer pathway to first-team football. They have found considerable success from here already too; Watkins to name one, Ethan Pinnock another. Toney looks set to follow. This is also what the B team was set up for in part, and the shift has already been indicated in recent signings at this level; none more so than Max Haygarth from Manchester United's U23s. One thing Brentford will not be doing is rushing to establish a presence in the newly-accessible South American market. A number of clubs, representation agencies and intermediaries in the UK have been rushing to build connections to bring talent in from this region, which is now on a par with Europe as far as the Home Office is concerned. The Bees do not have a strong network in South America, having carefully built theirs in Europe, and this is where their focus will remain for the foreseeable future. They believe their set-up is dynamic enough to be able to 'play it by ear' to an extent, and adapt to market changes when they occur. Brentford's project has always had the goal of winning promotion to the Premier League. And with the club now firmly among the contenders, planning is in motion to strengthen the squad to be able to stay there. The club are looking across all positions for players with the ability to come straight in and make an impact. They have put a strong squad together that has dealt fairly well with some key injuries this season, so any player coming in would have to improve them. The club are aware of interest from bigger clubs in several key players too; notably the left-back Rico Henry, central midfielder Josh Dasilva and goalkeeper David Raya. But they will not sell any of them in the current window in the hope they will be a Premier League club come the summer and they can keep them. But should they miss out again this season, these are also positions the club will need to find quality replacements for; players that will not need the season-or-so that the likes of Maupay and Benrahma had to adjust.

""It is a question really for the lads, I have been asked it a few times and said that I haven't got a clue what has gone wrong really at Manchester United this season.

Even last season Ole finishing second and you're thinking he's doing well, there is such a big gap. The biggest problem for Manchester United is where Manchester City are, where Liverpool are. ""We talk about Manchester United rebuilding as if Liverpool and Manchester City are going to take it easy over the summer. They are going to invest, they are going to get players in, they are going to get stronger. Klopp is staying on, Pep might stay on. ""When he comes in they have to get the recruitment right, he has to get players in and the right players through the door because the last few years just have not been good enough. ""The biggest disappointment for me when they have had these disappointments is the reaction. I don't think they have shown the leadership. Whatever about talent, there are not enough characters in that dressing room."" Could the example of Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool provide the template for Ten Hag in terms of expectations and the timeframe in which the new man might have United challenging again? Carragher believes so. ""I think it is very similar, it really is,"" he explained. ""I think it was possibly a harder job for Jurgen Klopp because the funds are there for the next Manchester United manager. We have seen that over the last 10 years and going forward will be a lot more than what Klopp had when he first came in. ""People talk about how long it should take Ten Hag or any top manager at a top club. There is talk of Liverpool and Manchester City possibly being five years ahead, I have even heard 10 years ahead of Manchester United. I think it is rubbish, I really do. ""I think a top manager gets a top club back on track in a couple of years. That is not to say winning the title or the Champions League but they get them back on track where they are competing. ""Liverpool came in November and they finished eighth in his first season. In some ways it would probably be better for United if they finished eighth and there was no European football. ""But they still reached a Europa League final, beat Manchester United on the way, some top teams, Villarreal, Borussia Dortmund, you thought there was something happening.  ""In that second season, the first full season, he got Champions League. That has to be what Manchester United get next season under Ten Hag. He has to. ""Liverpool were back on track in that third season. All great clubs should be judged on the Premier League and the Champions League. Not necessarily winning it but in with a shout. ""That is where Liverpool come in, they were Champions League runners-up in season three. They go on to win it and then win the Premier League but they are back at the party in year three. That is why I think the talk of five years or more is a nonsense."" Neville rejects the idea that Klopp had it harder than Ten Hag. ""I don't think so. Jurgen Klopp has done the most outrageous job at Liverpool, it has been outstanding. But there were no real set winners at that time when he came in. ""I would liken the job that Ten Hag has coming in and taking on these two outstanding managers who have set foundations at their clubs for five years more like Gerard Houllier's job when he came in and Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger were set. ""You are coming in when there are two or three managers - because I could put Thomas Tuchel in there as well - are set in their jobs and have that foundation. I think the job that Ten Hag has is absolutely huge."" But Neville accepts the timeframe suggested by Carragher. ""I don't disagree with Jamie's timeline of Champions League [qualification] in the first two seasons while he is sorting the recruitment out and getting used to the club. Third season getting very close to the point where the club has confidence and winning a trophy maybe. ""And that fourth year and fifth year is where you want to be winning a title, that is what we are looking at realistically. We would all hope he comes in and blows everyone away and Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola blow up somehow. But they are not blowing up are they?"" Even so, Keane thinks Ten Hag will back himself to have a big impact. ""Any top coach would come in with a bit of an ego and believe they can make a difference - certainly to this group,"" said Keane. ""They can't get any worse next season, surely? They can maybe win a cup or whatever and rebuild the club. ""Any top manager will believe he can get a reaction from the players and he will get backing. It might take a couple of windows but a good manager will believe that he can turn things around pretty quickly. Not in terms of winning trophies, but competing. ""The fans and the club have to get confidence in this new manager. Over the last few years, there have been doubts about Mourinho's style, Van Gaal, David Moyes, Ole. When he comes in, he needs proper support and that power he deserves to get.""

Jurgen Klopp's team head to Spain leading 2-0 as they look to progress to the final of Europe's premier club competition in Paris on May 28 against either Man City or Real Madrid. However, even if Liverpool fail to make it to the French capital, they have still managed to surpass the Chelsea side of 2006/07, whose own Quadruple challenge lasted all the way until May 1 of that campaign before losing to Liverpool in the Champions League semi-finals. And if Liverpool do manage to see off Villarreal on Tuesday, their next leg of the Quadruple will come against Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley on May 14, a repeat of this season's League Cup final, which the Reds won on penalties in February. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, in the race for the Premier League, Liverpool still just a point behind City as we enter the final four games of the season after an impressive unbeaten run in the league saw the champions' seemingly unsurmountable 14-point lead on January 15 evaporate. In total, Liverpool could face a gruelling seven-match schedule in May if they make it through to the final of European Cup at the Stade de France. So, how have other English teams got on when faced with such a daunting challenge, while surely the trophy-laden Liverpool sides of the 80s must have gone close to achieving the feat? And what about some of the great European giants of years gone by? Liverpool fixtures Premier League table As is surely common knowledge by now, no English team has ever won the Quadruple. Prior to this season, the closest any top-flight side had ever got to winning all four major trophies in a single campaign was Chelsea back in 2006/07. Heading into May of that season, Jose Mourinho's back-to-back Premier League champions had already landed the League Cup after beating Arsenal 2-1 at the Millennium Stadium, while they had an FA Cup final date to look forward to with Manchester United, who they were also going toe to toe with in the league. However, the Blues' challenge ended when they lost on penalties to Liverpool at Anfield in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final, while they would also go on to lose their title to United. Manchester United also came close to making history in 2008/09, only to slip up in the semi-finals of the FA Cup when losing 4-2 on penalties to Everton, although they did then get beaten 2-0 by Barcelona in that season's Champions League final in Rome. And, of course, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side have had numerous Quadruple bids as well since the Catalan arrived at the Etihad, the closest being in 2018/19 and last season. However, the former challenge was ended by Tottenham in the Champions League last eight and the latter after a defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals. Liverpool's current quest, though, will last at least until May 3, when the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with Villarreal concludes, meaning their Quadruple campaign will have lasted longer than any other English team's in history. And before you ask, Manchester United's famous Treble-winning season of 1998/99 actually included a League Cup quarter-final loss at Spurs in the December of that campaign. You would have thought Liverpool have come close before, but actually they have not, despite winning the League Cup four years in a row from 1981. It was the FA Cup that ultimately proved to be Liverpool's Achilles' heel in each of those four campaigns, with the Reds never managing to make it past the fifth round, meaning the closest they came was in 1982/83, only for a shock 2-1 home defeat to second division Brighton to end their Quadruple dreams in February. And it was Brighton again in the cup who scuppered the Reds' chances of winning all four trophies in their Treble-winning campaign the following season. Oddly enough, despite Klopp's 'Mentality Monsters' barely losing a game between 2018 and 2020, they never actually came close to winning the Quadruple. In fact, the nearest they came to achieving the feat was in their title-winning campaign of 2019/20, only for a youth side - selected because of a fixture clash with the Club World Cup - to lose 5-0 at Aston Villa in the League Cup quarter-finals to put an end that dream. In the first season in England when four trophies were up for grabs in 1960/61, it was Burnley who came closest before losing to Hamburg in the last eight of the European Cup in March 1961. However, Celtic did manage to accomplish the seemingly impossible in 1966-67 when Jock Stein's 'Lisbon Lions' won it all - the Scottish First Division, League Cup and Scottish Cup, followed by the first European Cup won by a British team after victory over Inter Milan. Well, the first thing to point out here is that up until the 2019-20 season, France, as in England, was the only other country in Europe's top-five major leagues to have an extra cup competition in the form of the League Cup, or Coupe de la Ligue. So that explains why European giants like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus have all never previously won the Quadruple. Paris Saint-Germain did, though, recently come within a whisker of pulling it off under Thomas Tuchel, only to fall agonisingly at the final hurdle. The big-spending Parisians were awarded that season's Ligue 1 title in April based on a points-per-game ratio after the campaign was prematurely curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when the season did eventually resume, PSG beat St Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final on July 24, before edging out Lyon 6-5 on penalties to claim the Coupe de la Ligue the following weekend. Then, when the Champions League also returned in August, Tuchel's team made it all the way to the final for the first time in the club's history, before unluckily losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. All of which shows just what a mountain Klopp and Co still face in order to make history this season...

United stopped talk of a potential walk-out demonstration by beating Brentford 3-0 in Rangnick's final home game as interim manager. Old Trafford had a feel-good environment for the game after a wretched season as it closed its doors for the summer with farewells to a host of first-team players who are out of contract. Nemanja Matic, Juan Mata, Phil Jones and Edinson Cavani in all probability made their final Old Trafford appearances, while Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard are also out of contract in the summer. Rangnick told Sky Sports: ""Apart from goalkeeping where we have three excellent goalkeepers in Tom Heaton, Dean Henderson and David de Gea, in all other areas there will be players leaving the club. I wouldn't put focus on special areas of the pitch - it should go through the whole team. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""So far we haven't been able to speak [to Ten Hag]. Erik's focus is on winning the Dutch league, our focus was on our games. ""It's obvious quite a few players will leave and there is a need for top-quality players. I strongly believe that if everyone works together we can bring Man Utd back to where we need to be. ""Other clubs only needed two or three transfer windows to challenge but from now on we need to bring in top-quality players who really help raise the level. If this happens then I don't think it should take too long."" Man Utd 3-0 Brentford - Match report Get Sky Sports Premier League table Premier League fixtures Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  One of the first players Erik ten Hag will need to talk to surrounding the future will be Cristiano Ronaldo, who has now scored nine of United's last 12 goals in the Premier League with a penalty in the 3-0 win. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner won the man-of-the-match award from Sky Sports co-commentator Gary Neville. Ronaldo's future has been cast into doubt due to United's likely failure to qualify for the Champions League, but his current deal runs until the summer of 2023. Rangnick believes if Ronaldo stays next season, he will need support in central striking positions as the player himself isn't fully comfortable at his age playing in the lone striking role. He said: ""Cristiano is not a central striker. He does not want to play in that position, in order to not play central, you have to play two strikers. If you look into international football, there are not many teams who play with two, you either have three or a false nine. It's not a question of a position, the club needs two new strikers who give this team more quality. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Modern strikers do not have to be wingers if you look at Liverpool and Man City, they have top strikers. Gabriel Jesus has hardly played and now he's playing regularly. If you ask me if he's a central striker or a winger, is Grealish a striker, they can switch and rotate. We don't have that many. Mason Greenwood would have been those players, but he's no longer part of the squad. Martial went on loan at Seville, Cavani has been injured."" United were pretty comfortable against Brentford and - with Ronaldo at the forefront - looked fluid and creative in attack. The result looks to have almost guaranteed their qualification for the Europa League next term by finishing sixth or higher - instead of playing in the Europa Conference League. ""In the end I'm not happy with the results [overall], especially in the last four or five weeks,"" Rangnick added. ""Until the West Ham game we were still in the race in three competitions. We had good moments until that West Ham game, we conceded fewer goals but in the last few weeks performances have not been as good as they should have been. In general we have lacked consistency.""

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12603750/premier-league-hits-and-misses-jordan-pickford-heroics-inspire-everton-survival-bid,Premier League hits and misses: Juan Mata puts in perfect Man Utd farewell,"How ironic that Juan Mata puts in one of his best Old Trafford performances on his final game at the ground. Eight years after moving to David Moyes's Manchester United from Chelsea, the Spanish number eight appeared to wave goodbye in style. In United's 3-0 win over Brentford on Monday night, Mata rolled back the years to his early Premier League days - who knows if we'll see him in England's top flight again? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mata showed pace, precision and skill that defies his veteran years - linking up with Cristiano Ronaldo frequently in a commanding first-half display. The pair - with a combined age of 71 - showed intricate passing in tight spaces which forced Mata to shoot wide of David Raya's goal - before the duo linked up again for Ronaldo's goal that was ruled out by VAR for offside. Ralf Rangnick recognised how much better United played and perhaps Mata was the cause of that. United had 74 per cent possession of the ball in the first half, with a passing accuracy of 91 per cent. ""That is the reason why we were controlling the game,"" said the German. ""It had to do with the players on the pitch such as Juan, Bruno [Fernandes] and Nemanja Matic."" While players such as Matic have confirmed they will be leaving United this summer, Mata is yet to do so. Rangnick couldn't confirm what the Spaniard will do, but hailed the midfielder's skill and professionalism in equal measure. Premier League table Premier League results Watch Premier League highlights Get Sky Sports ""I don't know [what he will do], he hasn't confirmed that but it's possible [that he will leave]. It was an important night for players who have been here quite a long time. If it was their last game to say farewell like this. ""In the last couple of weeks, he showed how professional he is and how much he loves his game. You can feel and see how much he is a professional player. He almost played like a magician.""Sam Blitz This was Brentford's first defeat with Christian Eriksen in the starting line-up but the Dane was blameless for that at Old Trafford. He was their outstanding performer and one of the best players on the pitch throughout, showcasing that trademark distribution. ""He has been so good, Eriksen,"" said Gary Neville on co-commentary for Sky Sports, before wondering about the player's future in the summer. ""There will be clubs a lot higher up than Brentford looking at him. Manchester United need a new midfield…"" Whether that move will come to fruition is unclear but Eriksen will clearly have options. Despite this being a convincing victory for Manchester United - Brentford were well beaten - the playmaker still created more chances than any player on the home team. It is wonderful to see Eriksen performing at something close to his best. Having proven his fitness and at only 30 years old, there are not many squads that he would not improve. It will be intriguing to find out what he decides to do next. For now, just enjoy him.Adam Bate Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In a World Cup year, the credentials of most of England's regular talent are examined in detail, but none more so than the number one position. Based on Sunday's superhuman display, Gareth Southgate needn't look any further than Jordan Pickford in Qatar - his performance may even be good enough to convince the staunchest of doubters. On a day where Everton's survival bid depended on three points, their goalkeeper was a man mountain. In actual fact, Pickford may have registered not one but two submissions for 'save of the season' - denying both Cesar Azpilicueta and Antonio Rudiger with monumental stops in the second half. ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves,"" said Sky Sports' Graeme Souness. It's difficult to disagree. The Toffees approach to the game was aggressive and that worked to unsettle Chelsea, who were a shade below their level best. Regardless, no player epitomised the game plan more than Pickford, who was dogged and antagonistic from the off. The 28-year-old had to be at his acrobatic best to preserve an all-important clean sheet and coped impressively under some relentless pressure, with Lampard reaffirming why he is so highly thought of on Merseyside: ""Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top level goalkeeping."" In the two Premier League meetings between Everton and Chelsea this season, the England international has managed 14 saves, conceding just once. The result may well be the spark Everton require to pull off a remarkable escape with five games remaining. Needless to say, they will have to exhibit a similar amount of stubbornness in every fixture between now and the end of term if that bid is to be successful.Laura Hunter Everton captain Seamus Coleman: ""That save he came back off the line and parried out was world class, and we see that on a daily basis in training, and that is why he is England's number one - some of the saves were world class.""   Everton boss Frank Lampard: ""Jordan made great saves. They are Chelsea and will have chances, but we had chances as well. Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top-level goalkeeping, I am happy with him and all the players, and all the subs who came on.""   Sky Sports' Graeme Souness: ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves. Some of the saves he's not entitled to get anywhere near them.""   Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp: ""The one to deny Azpilicueta is the save of the season. It was magnificent. We've given Pickford a lot of stick in the past, but he was brilliant."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Rob Holding was a surprise inclusion in Arsenal's team to face West Ham, but he certainly made his mark on the occasion. On a day when Mikel Arteta's side were some way below their fluid best, their stand-in centre-back typified the grit that got them over the line. Holding, starting alongside Gabriel Magalhaes in the absence of the injured Ben White, ensured Arsenal did not miss a player who had started more Premier League minutes than any other this season. He took his goal superbly, rising between two West Ham defenders to flick Bukayo Saka's corner past Lukasz Fabianski, but it was at the other end of the pitch that he truly shone. Shortly before his goal, there was a stunning block to deny the unmarked Manuel Lanzini. It was one of three he made over the course of the 90 minutes - two more than any other player. Holding put his body on the line repeatedly and also made nearly twice as many clearances (seven) as any of his team-mates. He was brave but also smart, positioning himself intelligently to cut out passes and ensure West Ham's forwards rarely threatened. Arteta was delighted by his contribution and talked up his importance in the dressing room - even if he does not get as many opportunities as he would like on the pitch. ""To good people, good things happen,"" said the Arsenal manager in his press conference. ""He's a phenomenal person and when you ask him to come, he's always ready."" With four, nerve-shredding games remaining in a gruelling top-four race, Holding's grit is sure to be needed again. Nick Wright Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tottenham's season has reached a defining stage. The long-awaited north London derby comes after a trip to title-chasing Liverpool, a daunting double before season-ending fixtures against Burnley and already-relegated Norwich. Sunday's victory over Leicester ensured Spurs' destiny remains in their hands ahead of the run-in and provided yet more evidence that Antonio Conte's squad harbours the talent required to complete a task that looked so unlikely when the Italian was appointed. Only Mohamed Salah has more Premier League goals to his name this season than Heung-min Son after the South Korean took his tally to 19 for the campaign in style with Spurs' spectacular third against the Foxes. It came after Son's first-half corner had set up Harry Kane for Tottenham's opener, with the striker ending his five-game goal drought with a clinical stooping header. The rekindling of Kane's goalscoring touch was enhanced by the impact surprise omission Dejan Kulusevski had coming off the bench and setting up both of Son's goals. Spurs' front three are firing - at the perfect time. If Spurs are going to pip north London rivals Arsenal to Champions League football, their front three are going to be crucial. Ahead of a pivotal final four games of the season, the manner of the victory over Leicester should have instilled confidence they can get the job done.Jack Wilkinson Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  North London is chasing. That's what will be at the forefront of Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel's mind after conceding defeat to a team blighted by potential relegation concerns. Perhaps Chelsea legs were tired - a legitimate grievance given they played away at Manchester United three days ago - but their performance was reserved, almost standoffish. Chelsea were far too kind to a side whose desperation could have easily played into their own hands. Chances were spurned, despite a heroic display from Everton stopper Jordan Pickford - over half of Chelsea's attempted shots (11) were off target. And yet there was still no sign of Romelu Lukaku from the bench. Third spot is still the Blues to lose, but both Arsenal and Tottenham are closing in. Stamford Bridge will now be cautiously looking over its proverbial shoulder. Three of Chelsea's six Premier League losses this season have come in their last six games - so is form a problem ahead of an FA Cup final against high-flying Liverpool on May 14? Well, it's clear that a prerequisite of the Chelsea job is silverware - something that Tuchel has previously delivered. But this season threatens to crumble if Chelsea manage to slip out of the top-four race and allow favourites Liverpool to clinch the FA Cup. The latter is the likelier of scenarios, but Chelsea must remain alert. They face Wolves, Leeds, Leicester and Watford in the Premier League run-in; crucially, three of those fixtures are at home. The Blues must draw upon their Stamford Bridge dominance to see them through a tricky patch and ensure they supersede their London rivals in the hunt for a top three finish.Laura Hunter Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Leicester have conceded 14 goals from corners in the Premier League this season, the most of any side, and it once again led to their downfall at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The visitors had started promisingly, with Patson Daka striking the foot of a post from inside the Tottenham area. But against the run of play the hosts took the lead when Harry Kane headed in from a corner, completely unmarked, which spurred them on to a 3-1 victory. Rodgers made eight changes to his side, with their focus firmly on the Europa Conference League semi-finals, yet no matter who they have fielded during this campaign, defending corners has been a constant issue. ""Defending corners has been a problem for us all season - we lack aggression and cuteness. It was so disappointing,"" said Rodgers, whose side have surpassed the most conceded in a single season since Brighton's 16 in 2017-18. ""It is something we will have to look at in the summer through personnel. The mentality to head the ball is missing, it's something we would need to address.""David Richardson Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

Everton are 18th in the Premier League table, just two points behind Leeds and Burnley outside of the relegation zone with a game in hand on both. Burnley enjoyed a hard-earned 2-1 comeback victory over Watford on Saturday, meaning the pressure was on for Frank Lampard and the Toffees to get a result. Richarlison's second-half goal at a raucous Goodison Park gave them victory, but speaking on Monday Night Football, Keane said some of the delays in play, prompted by Everton, left a sour taste. Keane said: ""Every time there was an injury, they were staying down for ages. Pickford made some great saves, but his time-wasting was disgraceful. ""But I totally get it. They must win a game of football. I think where Everton are, you're fighting for your lives, fighting for survival, for Frank, the players and for the supporters yesterday."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Everton have only won two out of their last six games - the other coming in a 1-0 victory against Manchester United, also at Goodison Park. Keane suggested the home atmosphere may have a big part to play in Everton's bid for survival. He said: ""The atmosphere, it was electric.

""Their total focus is on just defending, when it goes back to the keeper, they can go up the pitch and they can enjoy defending, but not worry about the other side of it."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking to Monday Night Football, Jamie Carragher praised Everton's direct approach in their last two games - particularly in their victory against Chelsea Carragher said: ""What's really jumped at me was how direct Everton were in those two games.

""Now that is a complete change for Frank Lampard in terms of his philosophy and how he's gone about things at Everton. Now, the interesting thing for me is: will that continue? ""What they did - and I have said it a lot doing this show for seven or eight years, Everton football. I've known that ever since I was a kid. But Goodison Park, going long, getting on second balls and being aggressive. ""Not too worried about playing through the lines, they are going to make it horrible and they are going to make it difficult."" He added: ""It's not pressing mad.

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/12599944/premier-league-clubs-best-and-worst-possible-final-positions-in-table,Premier League clubs' best and worst possible final positions in table,"Manchester City and Liverpool are locked in a two-horse race for the Premier League title - but how high or low could your club finish this season? Clubs have between two and five games left to seal their fate but 19 out of 20 clubs are still challenging for the title, qualification for the Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League, or to avoid the drop. Data guru Ben Mayhew has calculated each club's range of possible final league positions and found only Norwich have nothing to play for besides pride during the remainder of this season. Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United are all in the hunt to join title-tussling Manchester City and Liverpool in the top four - with Spurs and United potentially slipping as low as eighth to miss out on Europe next season altogether. With seventh spot being the lowest position to potentially offer a European berth, if permutations play out across competitions, it means all teams from fifth to 13th-placed Aston Villa retain the potential to qualify for Europe. Norwich were relegated on Saturday after a 2-0 defeat to Villa and results conspired against them elsewhere, but, theoretically, every single team sitting above the Canaries up to ninth-placed Brighton could finish in the drop zone. Watford have been widely written off in the survival race but the Hornets could still finish in 16th, while the attention for that final relegation spot centres on Everton, Leeds and Burnley - but all three could still secure a top-half finish.

The results suggest Manchester City have a 69-per-cent chance of retaining their Premier League crown, while Liverpool have almost the same chance of finishing as runners-up. Chelsea are nailed down for third spot at 93 per cent, with Arsenal pipping Tottenham to the final Champions League berth at 74 per cent - while Manchester United have a whopping 94-per-cent-chance of finishing in their current sixth spot. Each club’s attacking and defensive strength have been rated using an expected goals model, which measures the quality of chances they create and allow.  These ratings were then used to simulate the rest of the season 10,000 times to measure the probability of each club finishing in each league position. Further down the table - between Brighton and Southampton - things become far less predictable, with fairly even spreads between ninth and 15th. The probabilities consign Watford to the Championship but the pressure ramps up for the final drop spot, with Leeds favourites to finish in 18th (46 per cent), followed by Everton (31 per cent) and Burnley (23 per cent).

I obviously have good memories of him. He was a good character in the dressing room. Me and Peter weren't best of mates - actually far from it - but the most important thing is that I had huge respect for him and he produced in big moments and helped us get over the line in big matches. Peter would produce and help us win trophies. He was not getting called upon a lot but when he did he would produce. He made some excellent saves.""

He was a very good player and a really good team-mate. When those five or six come over to join training, you knew they were here to stay because they were really good players. I think Gary used to go to bed at half eight every evening and we would criticise him but he was a really top professional player. He properly loved the club and that came through.

""I could not leave Jaap Stam out. OK, he has not played as many games as the other lads but he was big and strong, brilliant one-v-ones. Did he have any real weaknesses? He could head it, he could leap, he could read the game, he was aggressive. He was a decent lad. I got on really well with him. I was not surprised when he left. He'd had a bad injury and when you are at a top club players do come and go. But he was a brilliant player for Manchester United."" ""The other one was an issue but I have gone with Gary Pallister.

He could head it, he could defend, he could get you a goal. And you know what, I enjoyed his company."" ""On the right side I have to go with Becks. He was a brilliant player. Where do you start?

If they were a distraction then you pull a young player aside. But he put a shift in."" ""You cannot pick a Manchester United team and leave Giggsy out. When I hear managers talking about players being consistent then Giggsy has to go in. Giggsy was in the team before me and had a lot of commitments off the field, he was a superstar in a sense. But his priority was his football."" ""When he came to United, he was still a kid. But you could just see the potential in him, the work rate, the desire. Did we all think he would go on and achieve the things he did in terms of the goals, the assists? No. But did we think he had a chance to become one of the greatest players ever? Yeah. A lot can happen. Injuries. Distractions. But look at Ronaldo. For all his off-the-field stuff, I don't think it was ever a distraction. We all liked him. He had that innocence.

It was widely expected that UEFA will ratify its plans at next week's Executive Committee meeting. However, there has been wholesale lobbying in the last fortnight since Sky Sports News highlighted the issue, from senior officials across Europe - including those from the Premier League, Scottish Premiership and the influential European Leagues organisation. UEFA is already committed to expanding the competition from 32 to 36 teams from 2024, but it has also announced plans for two Champions League ""wild cards"" to be allocated from then on. They would be given to the clubs with the highest UEFA ""coefficient"" who just failed to qualify via their domestic competition - for example, if Manchester United finished fifth in the Premier League. But those plans met an angry response from clubs across Europe who felt the plans were unfairly weighted towards the continent's elite, rather than based on sporting merit. The European Leagues has led calls for the extra places to instead be given to smaller nations whose champions don't automatically qualify for the Champions League group stages. The Scottish Premiership is one such league. Premiership winners to get CL group spot after Russian clubs banned Scottish Premiership live on Sky Sports Scottish Premiership fixtures Get Sky Sports And so if UEFA bows to pressure and scraps its plans for ""wild cards"" that would make it much more likely that future winners of the Scottish Premiership might automatically qualify for the Champions League group stages. As things stand, this season's Scottish Premiership winner will automatically enter the Champions League after UEFA banned Russian clubs from competing in its competitions, while next season's champions will also go straight into the 2023/24 group stages due to Scotland's ninth-place UEFA coefficient ranking. However, with an expanded Champions League, if the idea for ""wild cards"" or coefficient places is scrapped, that would offer a further boost to Scotland's top-flight winner in particular, who would be much more likely to gain automatic entry to the group stages from 2024. Sky Sports News has approached UEFA for comment, but they refused, saying that no final decisions have been taken before meetings of the Club Competitions Committee and Executive Committee in Vienna on May 10.

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12598812/who-qualifies-for-europe-how-premier-league-could-have-nine-teams-in-european-competitions-next-season,Who qualifies for Europe? How Premier League could have nine teams in European competitions next season,"The race for Europe is on but which teams make it - and how many - is still to be decided. With the Premier League campaign reaching its climax, we look at: There are seven European spots open to English sides - although that number could rise to nine and the amount of teams in each individual competition can shift. As a basis: However, because this season the FA Cup winner will be either Liverpool or Chelsea, and both those teams look set to finish in the top four, their Europa League qualifying spot for winning the FA Cup will be passed down to the next highest Premier League finisher who doesn't qualify for Europe. Similarly, because Liverpool won the Carabao Cup and are set to finish in the top four, their Europa Conference League qualifying spot from that competition will go to the next highest Premier League finisher without European football. So that means sides which finish sixth and seventh in the Premier League table are in contention for a place in either the Europa League or Europa Conference League next season. Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal would qualify for the Champions League by finishing in the Premier League's top four positions. Tottenham would go into the Europa League, along with Manchester United (who would get in thanks to Chelsea or Liverpool passing on their spot from winning the FA Cup). Seventh-placed West Ham would qualify for the Europa Conference League, thanks to Liverpool's Carabao Cup winner's spot being passed on. Manchester City and Liverpool have pulled clear at the top of the Premier League, and while their battle to win the Premier League title continues, they don't have to worry about Champions League qualification. Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp will still be plotting how to win this year's competition, and could meet in the final, but they already have their places in next season's tournament wrapped up through the league. Meanwhile, the last two spots in the top four are still up for grabs with Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham in contention with four games remaining. However, whatever the outcome, it will be a top-six finish at the very least for Chelsea and Arsenal, who return to European competition after missing out last season. Although not mathematically done yet, Spurs have all but guaranteed a Europa League spot with a nine-point gap between them and seventh-placed West Ham, who have just three matches left to play this season. Antonio Conte's side also have a far superior goal difference to the Hammers. The battle for the final Europa League spot continues between Man Utd and West Ham, while Wolves also have their eyes on finishing seventh and potentially securing a place in the Europa Conference League. If Manchester City or Liverpool win the Champions League they will automatically qualify for the competition's group stages next season. That is irrespective of where they finish in the Premier League table. If they qualify for the competition through two methods - ie: they win it and finish in the top four - there is no extra Champions League spot created for another team to fill and the number of Premier League clubs in next season's Champions League will remain at four. The Premier League could have a maximum of five teams in the Champions League next season, though, if West Ham won the Europa League and finished outside the top four. Winning that competition qualifies them for the Champions League group stages. If Leicester win the Europa Conference League they will automatically qualify for next season's Europa League - another additional European spot. That means, if West Ham and Leicester win their competitions and finish outside the Premier League's top seven there will be nine English sides in European competition next season. The nine sides would be: the top four and West Ham in the Champions League, fifth and sixth place, plus Leicester, in the Europa League, and seventh place in the Europa Conference League. But if Leicester were to win the Europa Conference League and finish seventh - the place set to be rewarded with a Europa Conference League spot - there would be no English side in the Europa Conference League next season, as Leicester would be bumped up to the Europa League. That happened in Spain last season with Sevilla and no La Liga side involved in the Europa Conference League. With Liverpool and Manchester City in the Champions League semi-finals, there's a good chance an English side would win the tournament - but that would have no impact on European qualification, with both sides set to finish in the top four. West Ham are into the semis of the Europa League and an additional Champions League spot is up for grabs if they win that competition. Their Europa Conference League spot for finishing seventh would disappear.Leicester - 10 points off seventh with two games in hand - could be playing European football again next year if they progress from their semi-final and win the Europa Conference League to earn an additional spot in the Europa League. Regardless of any permutation, no side finishing eighth in the Premier League will qualify for Europe, unless they've won a domestic or European cup. Eighth-placed Wolves would be the highest-finishing Premier League team to miss out on European football, although they are just three points behind West Ham and five off Manchester United, with a game in hand on both.

Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp's sides look destined to remain almost neck-and-neck until the very end of the Premier League season for the second time in four years with both sides victorious on Saturday, to leave City a point ahead in the standings with four games remaining. Both sides rested players due to their Champions League semi-final commitments but after a Mo Salah-less Liverpool edged to a 1-0 win at Newcastle in the lunchtime kick-off, Manchester City saw off a Leeds side unbeaten in five games with a 4-0 victory at Elland Road to leapfrog them back to the top of the table, despite making five changes from their match with Real Madrid in midweek. Neville told the Gary Neville Podcast the two teams had transformed the title race from the ""fights"" of his time as a player at Manchester United into a spectacle both appear to enjoy, with the increasing pressure of keeping up with their title rival never showing - and the prospect of a faultless end to the season a real possibility. He said: ""The thing that actually City have done tonight, which is massively impressive, but they make it look easy, is that when we were up against the team going for a title and they played before us, we always wanted to play first. ""When Liverpool have gone and done what they did at lunchtime today at Newcastle, after Villarreal in midweek and all the games they've had recently, you're thinking that switches the pressure to City, but you never really get the impression that these two teams feel that pressure.

""What Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola are doing today is, they're basically empowering the squad,"" said Neville. ""You hear managers say 'I've got a great squad', but have you got the guts and the courage to really use that squad in big matches where you need to win? ""Where you know if you don't win there is a large consequence, or you're probably going to lose a league title, or you're going to get knocked out of a European Cup competition. So to do it and then come out of it and win - you've empowered everybody. ""You've made everybody feel part of it, and the strength in that squad and the commitment of everybody means that you start to blend into the feeling of every three days, you know everyone's had a game, no one feels like there's a first eleven. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It's a real mistake to name your first eleven, then always play that first eleven in modern football, if you're going to go for three and four trophies because you're going to need those five and six and seven on the bench. And so to keep them included to make them feel part of it, get them on the pitch if you can, even it's for 10 or 15 minutes at the end. ""It's really critical that you make everybody feel proud of being part of the squad because there is absolute certainty there is going to come a game that will catch you out, and you're going to need two or three subs to come on and save you. That could be a defensive sub, it could be an attacking sub as well more often than not. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""We had it in the Champions League final, where we had two subs come off the bench and win it for us. Liverpool have that in them, Manchester City have that in them, but you need to keep those players in form, confident, fit, part of it, energised. Making them feel like they're contributing to the success, and it's not just a token gesture where you're being played in the sort of weak games."" ""It's the first time Jurgen Klopp's left Mo Salah out in what feels like an absolute age, but he must have felt that was a game that he could leave him out in. Why he thought that, we don't know. But when I saw that, I thought, 'Right, what message does that send to the rest of the Liverpool players?'. ""I just thought because he's played Salah in every game, the game that he leaves Salah out in, I thought would be a risk because it tells the rest of the players something. I just thought there was a risk there when I saw the team news come through. I thought that's a test for the other players because they know this guy is going to come straight back in against Villarreal. They know he's number one. So can we get through without him? ""So those Liverpool players come off today getting through without him, and City have got through without De Bruyne, and I think that's the two best players - I think Van Dijk competes with Salah in terms of importance - but those are the two star players.

Loadingâ¦ In goal, Keane selected Peter Schmeichel ahead of Edwin van der Sar and David De Gea, despite claiming the fiery Dane ""wasn't as good"" as everyone thought. He then picked Dennis Irwin at left-back and Gary Neville at right-back, before naming Jaap Stam and Gary Pallister as his preferred centre-back pairing. Explaining his decision to pick Pallister over the likes of Ferdinand, Steve Bruce and Nemanja Vidic, Keane said on Sky Sports: ""The other one was an issue but I have gone with Gary Pallister. Brucey was a brilliant player but you have to leave someone out. ""Rio was obviously a good athlete and read the game well but my relationship with Pally was pretty good as well. ""Certain lads at United go out of their way to help you. He was obviously a very good player. Always looked exhausted but I would have him in there."" Keane modestly chose to leave himself out of the side, instead selecting former United captain Bryan Robson in central midfield. ""Robson has to go in there. Bryan was a great player for Manchester United, full of courage and scored some big goals for Manchester United when the club was not at its best,"" added Keane. Surprisingly, Keane then selected Paul Ince to pair Robson in central midfield, snubbing former teammate Paul Scholes. ""Incey was a very good player, maybe tarnished his United reputation with him playing for Liverpool or whatever,"" added Keane. ""There is a lot of talk about Incey being the 'Guv'nor' and that was held against him but that was just banter. There was no nastiness with that. Incey was a really good teammate and I thought he was a very good player. ""It was tough leaving Scholesy out and [Nicky] Butt, brilliant players and brilliant characters. But I just thought Incey in that first season I was there, when we won the double, he was brilliant in midfield. ""He was a good team-mate to have next to you in the trenches."" Keane completed his midfield with Ryan Giggs on the left wing and David Beckham on the right. And up front, he named Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo as his two strikers, leaving out the likes of Eric Cantona, Andy Cole, Dwight Yorke and Ruud van Nistelrooy.

It looks increasingly likely that the 29-year-old midfielder will leave in the coming weeks after a frustrating few months at Old Trafford. After an impressive loan spell at West Ham last year, Lingard has made just 22 appearances in all competitions for the Premier League strugglers this season, but most of them have come from the bench. Lingard, who is out of contract at the end of the season, could feature for United in their final two Premier League away games against Brighton and Crystal Palace. But interim manager Ralf Rangnick decided against giving his first-team minutes on Monday night in their last game of the season at Old Trafford â a decision that didn't go down well with his brother, Louie Scott. After 20 years at the club, Scott believes his sibling should have been given a proper send off in front of over 70,000 fans. ""20 years of blood sweat and tears, 4 domestic trophies, 3 cup final goal, not even a farewell,"" Scott wrote on his private Instagram story. ""No wonder it's Conference League next year. ""Attacking players for celebrations when the clubs being sold to the super league ok. Class of 92, Busby Babes, you're ran by people who don't even know the offside trap. Classless and the fans need to realise. Goodnight, godbless! ""Been there since nine years of age and didn't even get a send off!!! Well done bro your family are proud."" Lingard is set to end his 20-year association with the club this summer, with Serie A giantsAC MilanandJuventus 'leading the chase' to land the England international on a free transfer. That being said, the Italian clubs face stiff competition from a number of Premier League outfits, with Newcastle thought to be keen on snapping up the 29-year-old, while former club West Ham may reignite their interest. The disrespect our club has showed @JesseLingard tonight makes my blood boil @ManUtd you are a joke regardless how the club has treated you jesse just know us united fans love and will miss you youâve always given your all for the club i hope your next club appreciates you moreâ¤ï¸ Last month, Manchester United's all-time top goalscorer Wayne Rooney named four players who they should build the team around, including Lingard. ""I think [Jadon] Sancho will be better next year, Marcus [Rashford] will be better next year,"" the club's all time top goalscorer said on Monday Night Football. ""They've got good young players. I think Jesse Lingard should be playing for them because he brings energy, brings quality. Scott McTominay's done well, ""So they do have some good young players, you just have to get some confidence and get them believing that they're good players and perform at the best level. ""And then obviously, whoever the new manager is, I'm sure he'll bring his own players in and build that through."" Thoughts on Lingard not getting minutes against Brentford on Monday night?

Ralf Rangnick gave the Spanish playmaker his first Premier League start for Manchester United on Monday night in their clash against Brentford â and they looked a better side with him on the pitch as they recorded a comfortable 3-0 win. It was a night of firsts. United made over 400 passes in the first half of a Premier League game for the first time this season against Thomas Frank's side; an improvement on a host of poor performances in recent months. And top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo linked up wonderfully with Mata, who appeared to say his final farewell to fans at Old Trafford after an eight-year spell with the club. The Mata-Ronaldo show. pic.twitter.com/MCq3eLxJLi The 34-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and although he has yet to confirm his plans regarding his future, it appears the former Spain international will leave after waving to all corners of the stadium on Monday night. It has been a journey of mixed feelings for former Valencia and Chelsea attacking midfielder Mata. He's made a total of 283 appearances for United since being brought in by David Moyes for Â£37.1 million in 2014, but he has struggled for first-team minutes in recent years, despite showing glimpses of brilliance. Despite a lack of opportunitues at United, the experienced playmaker has always maintained his class off the pitch. After the full-time whistle on Monday night, he stayed behind at Old Trafford to sign autographs and take pictures with fans in the pouring rain. In fact, pictures of Mata meeting fans emerged on social media at 11:45pm and beyond. Juan Mata spent several minutes in the rain posing for photos & signing autographs.

According to a report from The Daily Mail, he helps unload the dirty laundry after games, as well as cleaning up the boots and other clothing. A source at the club spoke about his contributions off the pitch. ""Juan is a special guy, he has started to help the kit man and his staff over the last couple of months."" he said. ""It sums up what kind of person he is. While his team-mates just jump into their flashy motors and zoom off after being dropped off back after away games, Juan has taken it on himself to stay behind and give a helping hand to the ordinary staff. ""It's a huge job to unload all the gear off the coach and takes a good while. ""People have been saying what a great gesture it is but to be honest it's just typical of the man - we are saying he has to be the nicest man in football."" Manchester United manager Ralf Rangnick labelled Mata as a ""magician"" after the 3-0 win against Brentford. When asked if he could have used Mata more often throughout the campaign, the interim boss said: ""Yes, maybe it was the first game he played from the beginning, [but it] also had to do with the opposition in this position and in the last couple of weeks he was one of the players who showed in training how professional he is and how much he loves the game. He had moments when he played like a magician."" Do you think United should have used Mata more? Let us know in the comments. ",positive,manchester united,2

Loadingâ¦ Goal celebrations aren't always as happy as they could be, which Richarlison could potentially find out in the wake of throwing a flare back towards the crowd. In 2017, Van Persie was involved in a very angry goal celebration, after scoring in an Istanbul derby during a very heated Turkish Cup game. The Dutchman and Ozyakup had been mates when the pair were at Arsenal at the same time, though the Turkish international only ever played twice for the Gunners. However when the pair met in Turkey things went downhill quickly, with them exchanging words during the game after Ozyakup's teammate Dusko Tosic was sent off for pushing Van Persie.

Whilst it got him three days off, it also temporarily ended the striker's friendship with Ozyakup, with the midfielder admitting he'd lost respect for his former teammate. ""I was very good friends with a certain player on the field. That changed today,"" he said after the game. âSometimes you see the real face of a footballer on the field.â Whilst the Besiktas man admitted later in that year that they still weren't talking, adding, ""I do not think I was in the wrong, if anything I was wrong to show Robin as much respect as I did,"" thing eventually got better.

Loadingâ¦ A miserable season at Old Trafford will come to end on Monday night, as United play their final home game, ahead of two away fixtures. Fans have only seen their team win nine times in the league in Manchester so far this season, which is actually an improvement on their away form, and the end of the campaign probably can't come soon enough. When the final whistle is blown following the game against Thomas Frank's team the players are set to take a lap of honour, or give a lap of appreciation to the fans, depending on how it's spun. A group of fans will miss the gesture however, as there is a planned walkout 17 minutes from the end of the match, to protest the 17 years the club has been under American ownership from the Glazer family. In recent games the 17 minutes of not being in their seats has come before kick off but the Brentford match protests are planned for the final part of the game. Whilst the club are aware that the players might not get the best reception during their lap, there are several players playing in front of the home fans for the last time. Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata's contracts are both expiring, so could play their last minutes at Old Trafford, whilst Paul Pogba and Edinson Cavani are in the same situation but injured. Nemanja Matic has also revealed that he wants to leave in the summer, and others are expected to depart with the arrival of Erik ten Hag likely to lead to a clearout. Some players may get a warm reception but Pogba, whose future isn't sorted yet, was recently booed when coming off in the game against Norwich City. Monday's game comes a year after the club's fans had their most 'successful' protest against the owners, as they managed to get a game with Liverpool postponed. Thousands gathered outside of Old Trafford, whilst games were still being played behind closed doors due to Covid, and hundreds even got onto the pitch. There were also protests outside of the hotels the two sets of players were gathered at, stopping the clubs getting to the match, and it was played at a later date.

Bergwijn arrived at the club as a 22-year-old from PSV Eindhoven for a £27m fee in the January window two years ago, but he has struggled to nail down a regular spot in the first XI. A dream Premier League debut saw Bergwijn net in a 2-0 victory at home to Manchester City, while he has appeared on 29 occasions in all competitions during the 2021-22 season. However, Bergwijn has only managed to register four goals and two assists in that spell, with both of his Premier League strikes coming in that dramatic late victory at Leicester City back in January. Bergwijn's heroics in that game have not led to better fortunes for the 24-year-old, though, and he has only made the first XI in four top-flight games this term. © Reuters As a result, Bergwijn is being strongly linked with an exit from Antonio Conte's side in the upcoming summer window as he pushes for a place in the Netherlands squad at the 2022 World Cup. With Bergwijn's compatriot Erik ten Hag taking over at Manchester United in the summer, the Red Devils are supposedly interested in bringing the Dutchman to Old Trafford as part of their attacking shake-up. The former PSV man has now admitted that a transfer away from Spurs is the likeliest option at the end of the season, telling Dutch outlet AD: ""A starting place here? I honestly don't think so. ""It's a difficult story for me. It's good up front, but I don't play much. There are still four games to go. After that, we will see in the summer what is best for both parties. It's important to me that I'm going to play now."" Bergwijn spent six years in the youth setup at Ajax between 2005 and 2011 before heading for PSV, and the Dutchman would be open to a return to the Amsterdam giants. ""Ajax would certainly be an option. A return to the Netherlands would certainly be an option for me. The World Cup is coming. Mr Van Gaal, the national coach, brought me into the squad last time, even though I didn't play much,"" Bergwijn added. © Reuters ""Of course it's nice that you just score those goals and show that you can be a full-fledged player. But then you come back to the club and you hardly play. In the summer we really have to look for a solution."" When asked about the prospect of linking up with Ten Hag at Man United next season, Bergwijn left the door open to a possible move, responding: ""I haven't spoken to him yet, but who knows, maybe that will happen."" Bergwijn was brought off the bench for the final eight minutes of Sunday's 3-1 home win over Leicester City, and he has not started a Premier League game for Conte's side since their 2-0 loss to Chelsea on January 23. The Dutchman has now made a total of 80 appearances in all competitions for the North London club, during which time he has scored eight goals and set up 10 more. In spite of his struggles at club level, Bergwijn came up with the goods for the Netherlands in March's international friendlies, bagging a brace against Denmark in a 4-2 win before also making the net ripple in a 1-1 draw with Germany.

Lage's side were at one point challenging for an unlikely Champions League berth, but a drop-off in form has left them outside of the European places in eighth position - three points adrift of West Ham United with a game in hand. Neves now only has two years left on his contract with the Molineux side, and failure to secure a continental spot for the 2022-23 season could tempt the Portugal international into a move elsewhere. Arsenal and Manchester United have both been linked with a swoop for Neves, with the Red Devils understood to have recently sent scouts to watch the midfielder in action for Wolves. Despite the impending arrival of Franck Kessie from AC Milan on a free transfer, Barcelona are also thought to be keen to bring Neves to Catalonia as part of their summer overhaul. © Reuters While Lage has admitted that it may be difficult for Wolves to keep hold of Neves this summer, the Portuguese has insisted that the midfielder is worth at least £100m in the upcoming market. ""These days we need to be ready for everything. A player like this has a value of £100m. Anything can happen, not just with Ruben. If we want to improve we need the best guys at the best price,"" Lage told reporters at a press conference last week. As a result, Sport claims that Barcelona will therefore be priced out of a move for Neves, who they had initially identified as an ideal long-term replacement for Sergio Busquets. Busquets will celebrate his 34th birthday in July and still has one more year to run on his deal with the Blaugrana, but Barcelona are understandably planning for life without the Spaniard. The report adds that Barcelona are not closing the door on a move for Neves fully, with Wolves unable to play hardball in negotiations should the Portuguese continue to wind his contract down. Neves allegedly dreams of pulling on the Barcelona shirt, meanwhile, and agent Jorge Mendes's strong working relationship with the Catalan side could ultimately aid a bid for the former Porto youngster. © Reuters Neves arrived at Wolves in the summer of 2017 after rising through the ranks in Porto's youth system and immediately helped the club achieve promotion to the Premier League with six goals in 42 Championship matches in 2017-18. The lynchpin has gone on to make 208 appearances for the Molineux outfit in all competitions, scoring 24 goals and providing 12 assists in that spell. Fifteen of those goals and eight assists have come in 138 Premier League appearances, and he has made the starting lineup on 27 occasions in the top flight this season. Neves had missed the start of April due to a knee injury but was fit enough to play the first 45 minutes of the weekend's 3-0 loss to Brighton & Hove Albion - Wolves' fourth defeat in five Premier League games. As well as Neves, Barcelona are also reported to be interested in Valencia midfielder Carlos Soler, but Los Che were recently forced to release a statement denying the existence of a €20m (£16.8m) transfer agreement between the two clubs.

Tielemans has remained an integral cog in the Leicester engine room this season, and he is not expected to be short of suitors if he seeks a move away from the FA Cup holders. The likes of Liverpool, Real Madrid and Man United have all been credited with an interest in the Belgium international, while Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur have also been linked with summer swoops. Despite reported interest from a wide range of Premier League clubs, journalist Sacha Tavolieiri has put Real Madrid on red alert by claiming that Tielemans has his heart set on a move to La Liga. © Reuters ""While he should leave Leicester City this summer, Youri Tielemans would have told those around him his preference for a departure to Spain,"" Tavolieri tweeted. ""The Real Madrid, interested, could position itself concretely in the coming weeks... To be continued."" Real Madrid are not short of midfield options at present having secured the signature of Eduardo Camavinga, while Luka Modric has also allegedly agreed to stay on for at least one more season. However, with Modric now approaching the final knockings of his career while Toni Kroos and Casemiro continue in their 30s, Real boss Carlo Ancelotti could plan for the future with 24-year-old Tielemans alongside Camavinga and Federico Valverde. Real are understood to have enquired about Tielemans's availability in the January transfer window but decided against a move when learning of the Belgium international's £50m price tag. Manchester United's midfield is also expected to undergo a major overhaul this summer, with Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba expected to depart as free agents at the end of their contracts. Tielemans is expected to be one of several targets on the Red Devils' wishlist this summer, with a recent report claiming that James Ward-Prowse was also being eyed up by Erik ten Hag. © Reuters Tielemans initially arrived on loan at the King Power Stadium for the second half of the 2018-19 season and was immediately snapped up on a permanent deal after providing three goals and five assists in those six months. The former Anderlecht youngster has since gone on to register 24 goals and 23 assists in 153 appearances for Rodgers's side, including the winning goal in the final of last season's FA Cup against Chelsea. Tielemans's statistics this season include seven goals and four assists from 44 matches continentally and domestically, with six of those strikes coming in Premier League action. However, with the Europa Conference League semi-final second leg with Roma in mind, Tielemans was only brought off the bench for the final 14 minutes of Sunday's 3-1 loss to Tottenham Hotspur. Tielemans's feats in the 2020-21 campaign also saw him rewarded with the club's Player of the Season accolade, but his contract situation could supposedly lead to Leicester to consider bids in the region of £25m this summer.

Despite both teams sloppily gifting possession away in the opening exchanges, Arsenal made the breakthrough as Holding - deputising for the injured Ben White - headed home his first Premier League goal from Bukayo Saka's corner. However, Jarrod Bowen's deflected finish off the leg of Gabriel Magalhaes ensured that David Moyes's side would restore parity before half time, but the Brazilian defender soon went from zero to hero for Arsenal. Gabriel Martinelli's cross to the back stick met the head of an unmarked Gabriel, whose header proved too powerful for ex-Arsenal man Lukasz Fabianski to keep out in a 2-1 success for the North London club. © Reuters Arsenal have now maintained their two-point lead over Tottenham Hotspur with only four games left to play this season, and Arteta made sure Holding's contribution did not go unnoticed. ""I said to you guys, to good people, to good things happen and Rob is another great example, but now when he plays well to give him credit, especially when he doesn't play, the way he trains, the way he is amongst the team, he's just a phenomenal person and player to have around the team and today, when you ask him to come he's always ready to do something,"" Arteta said during his post-match press conference. ""Rob Holding is really good being Rob Holding and he needs to be really happy with what he's done today for the team.""

""In England you say 'win ugly', I think from my point of view today we won ugly, and I'm extremely happy to see a team that has this capacity to find a way to win and show the character that they showed today,"" the Spaniard added. ""It's a massive win, under very difficult circumstances because we put ourselves in real problems, especially with our decision-making and in ball possessions, and the spaces we were attacking, and the timing of it and the efficiency of it. But the team showed huge character, not to give up, to continue trying to do the right things."" © Reuters The Gunners were dealt an early blow before the game as White missed out due to hamstring tightness, while Saka and Takehiro Tomiyasu both made the first XI - the latter starting for the first time since New Year's Day in the Premier League. Fears of further injuries were raised when the pair trudged off the field in the second half, but Arteta sought to alleviate any fears of long-term issues for the duo. ""Ben got injured against Manchester United, he felt a muscular problem and we checked him, and we will have to access him in the next few days to see how he is,"" Arteta told reporters.

Reports have suggested that an agreement has now been reached for the Dutchman to sign a four-year deal with Man United, while current boss Rangnick moves up into an advisory role. Confirmation of Ten Hag's appointment could allegedly arrive soon after Ajax's KNVB-Beker game against PSV Eindhoven on Sunday, and speculation has already started swirling regarding possible coaching appointments and signings early in his reign. The Daily Mail claims that Tottenham's Steven Bergwijn is one of the players on his radar, having held a long-standing interest in the 24-year-old. Ten Hag attempted to sign Bergwijn for Ajax during the January transfer window, only for Spurs to block the deal in the hope that the Netherlands international would help to secure Champions League qualification this season. However, the winger has since started just one Premier League game, falling behind January arrival Dejan Kulusevski in the pecking order courtesy of the Juventus loanee's prolific partnership with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. The report claims that Tottenham would now be willing to let Bergwijn leave the club this summer, but only if their £20m asking price is met. There is understood to be interest from clubs in Germany and France, although Ten Hag's possible arrival at Old Trafford could see Manchester United jump to the front of the queue. Ten Hag was in the stadium to watch Bergwijn score three times for Netherlands in games against Denmark and Germany during the recent international break, and has reportedly tried to sign him for Ajax in each of the last three transfer windows. Bergwijn recently hinted that he will assess his future in the summer due to a lack of playing time at Spurs. Ten Hag, meanwhile, is thought to want to bring the likes of Antonio Rudiger, Jurrien Timber and Declan Rice to Old Trafford should he take over, while coaches such as Robin van Persie, Steve McClaren and Mitchell van der Gaag are among those to have been linked with a backroom role under the 52-year-old. Bergwijn has featured 27 times in all competitions for Spurs this season, including 20 in the Premier League, but only four of those league appearances have been from the start. Since joining Spurs from PSV in January 2020, he has scored eight goals and created 10 more in 78 appearances.  ",negative,manchester united,1

Bergwijn arrived at the club as a 22-year-old from PSV Eindhoven for a £27m fee in the January window two years ago, but he has struggled to nail down a regular spot in the first XI. A dream Premier League debut saw Bergwijn net in a 2-0 victory at home to Manchester City, while he has appeared on 29 occasions in all competitions during the 2021-22 season. However, Bergwijn has only managed to register four goals and two assists in that spell, with both of his Premier League strikes coming in that dramatic late victory at Leicester City back in January. Bergwijn's heroics in that game have not led to better fortunes for the 24-year-old, though, and he has only made the first XI in four top-flight games this term. © Reuters As a result, Bergwijn is being strongly linked with an exit from Antonio Conte's side in the upcoming summer window as he pushes for a place in the Netherlands squad at the 2022 World Cup. With Bergwijn's compatriot Erik ten Hag taking over at Manchester United in the summer, the Red Devils are supposedly interested in bringing the Dutchman to Old Trafford as part of their attacking shake-up. The former PSV man has now admitted that a transfer away from Spurs is the likeliest option at the end of the season, telling Dutch outlet AD: ""A starting place here? I honestly don't think so. ""It's a difficult story for me. It's good up front, but I don't play much. There are still four games to go. After that, we will see in the summer what is best for both parties. It's important to me that I'm going to play now."" Bergwijn spent six years in the youth setup at Ajax between 2005 and 2011 before heading for PSV, and the Dutchman would be open to a return to the Amsterdam giants. ""Ajax would certainly be an option. A return to the Netherlands would certainly be an option for me. The World Cup is coming. Mr Van Gaal, the national coach, brought me into the squad last time, even though I didn't play much,"" Bergwijn added. © Reuters ""Of course it's nice that you just score those goals and show that you can be a full-fledged player. But then you come back to the club and you hardly play. In the summer we really have to look for a solution."" When asked about the prospect of linking up with Ten Hag at Man United next season, Bergwijn left the door open to a possible move, responding: ""I haven't spoken to him yet, but who knows, maybe that will happen."" Bergwijn was brought off the bench for the final eight minutes of Sunday's 3-1 home win over Leicester City, and he has not started a Premier League game for Conte's side since their 2-0 loss to Chelsea on January 23. The Dutchman has now made a total of 80 appearances in all competitions for the North London club, during which time he has scored eight goals and set up 10 more. In spite of his struggles at club level, Bergwijn came up with the goods for the Netherlands in March's international friendlies, bagging a brace against Denmark in a 4-2 win before also making the net ripple in a 1-1 draw with Germany. The three-time Eredivisie champion remains under contract at Tottenham until the end of the 2024-25 campaign, and the Lilywhites may allegedly be prepared to consider offers of around £15m for the out-of-favour attacker this summer.

Bayern are believed to be open to selling Lewandowski this summer if he does not sign an extension, as they are fearful of losing him on a free transfer at the end of next season. Barcelona have been strongly linked with the experienced striker, and it has been claimed that the La Liga club have already met with his agent Pini Zahavi to discuss a switch this summer. However, when questioned on the recent speculation, Alemany insisted that his club had not held a meeting with the Bayern forward's representative. © Reuters ""There was no meeting with Lewandowski's agent. Also, I don't like to speak about the negotiations process - it's something private. We don't like to discuss players who are under contract with other clubs,"" Alemany told Movistar. The 33-year-old has again been in strong form at club level during the 2021-22 campaign, finding the back of the net on 49 occasions in 44 appearances, in addition to contributing six assists. Lewandowski recently suggested that he would be open to leaving Bayern in the upcoming market, with the Bundesliga giants looking for a fee in the region of £33m. Manchester United have also been strongly linked with the forward, as the Red Devils prepare to bring at least one new attacker to Old Trafford in the upcoming market. However, Barcelona are believed to be in pole position for his signature, with Lewandowski thought to be keen to play in Spain before the end of his career. © Reuters The Poland international has scored 343 goals and registered 71 assists in 373 appearances for Bayern since making the move from Borussia Dortmund in July 2014. Lewandowski has won eight Bundesliga titles, three German Cups and the Champions League during his time at Allianz Arena, but he is thought to be keen on a fresh challenge ahead of next season. Barcelona signed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Arsenal in January, and the Gabon international has scored 11 goals and registered one assist in 19 appearances for the Catalan giants. However, the futures of Memphis Depay, Ousmane Dembele, Martin Braithwaite, Adama Traore and Luuk de Jong are unclear, so the La Liga giants are expected to enter the market for at least one new striker this summer. Ansu Fati made his long-awaited injury return against Mallorca on Sunday, playing the final 15 minutes of his side's 2-1 victory at Camp Nou.

However, there is now understood to be more optimism about the prospect of Mbappe penning fresh terms with the Ligue 1 champions following talks between the club and the player's family. When asked during a press conference how confident he was about the club's chances of keeping Mbappe at this moment in time, Pochettino responded ""100%"", but the Argentine took those words back following his side's 3-3 draw with Strasbourg on Friday night, as well as a similar comment that he made regarding his own future at the club. © Reuters ""I'm very tired because it's hard to explain, but I tried. I only answered the question I was asked: 'Today, what percentage is there?' 'For me, 100 percent. Kylian too,' I said,"" Pochettino told Amazon Prime Video.

Pochettino collected his first domestic league crown as PSG clinched the Ligue 1 title with a 1-1 draw against Lens last month, but the Argentine's own future is being heavily called into question following their Champions League collapse at the hands of Real Madrid. The ex-Tottenham Hotspur manager was considered one of the frontrunners for the Manchester United job before the appointment of Erik ten Hag, although a recent report claimed that the French champions are indeed planning to part ways with Pochettino. © Reuters Current Spurs boss Antonio Conte has been tipped to take over at PSG should Pochettino depart as expected, but the Italian recently dismissed such links as ""fake news"" and ""lies"". Meanwhile, Mbappe is not expected to make a decision on his future until the end of the 2021-22 campaign, during which he has already bagged a staggering 35 goals and 23 assists in 43 matches across all tournaments. Twenty-four of Mbappe's goals and 16 of his assists have come in 32 Ligue 1 matches for the newly-crowned champions, as he scored two and set up Achraf Hakimi but could not prevent PSG from giving up a 3-1 lead to draw 3-3 with Strasbourg on Friday. Mbappe unsurprisingly leads the way in both goals and assists in Ligue 1, with his 24 strikes three clear of closest challengers Wissam Ben Yedder and Martin Terrier, while teammate Lionel Messi is closest behind in assists with 13. The 2021-22 Ligue 1 title represents Mbappe's 12th major honour with Les Parisiens since his initial loan move from Monaco, with the striker picking up four Ligue 1 crowns, a trio of Coupe de France and French Super Cup crowns, as well as two French League Cups.

Xavi recently labelled De Jong the ""future"" of Barcelona amid links with a switch to Old Trafford, but the midfielder is still reported to be considering his future having grown frustrated at his lack of 90-minute games.

Manchester City's stuttering start to the campaign might see them make a late foray into the transfer market for a new left-back, with Bayern Munich's David Alaba and Ajax's Nicolas Tagliafico among those being apparently courted.

Qualification for the Champions League would help to boost Arsenal's coffers, and Arteta's side currently sit two points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur in the table before Sunday's fixtures commence. A plethora of attacking targets have already been mooted after Arsenal missed out on the signature of Dusan Vlahovic in January, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Gabriel Jesus and Darwin Nunez all mentioned. Arsenal have supposedly already agreed to sign Manchester City's Jesus in a £42m deal, but Arteta has warned Gooners not to expect his side to fork out mammoth fees on one player like Liverpool did for Alisson Becker and Virgil van Dijk. ""I don't think we are in a position where we can do that, so we have to find other ways to do it,"" Arteta told Sky Sports News when questioned on Liverpool's big-money defensive signings. © Reuters ""Liverpool, as well, have improved their players immensely, which is as important as bringing players in. And then, the ones that you buy, [it's important] that they can have an impact straight away. ""That's a big decision they have to make in recruitment, and then they are human beings as well. They have to adapt, and sometimes that's a tricky question to answer before they are actually here. ""We want to make the squad stronger, we want to make the starting XI stronger, we want to make the specificity and the personality of our players stronger, and that's what we are going to be seeking to do. ""It will depend on many factors - how many players are back from their loans, with the commitments we still have with them; our financial position in relation to where we finish; the clubs' demands when we want to buy players or sell players. There are a lot of question marks there, but this is football."" A new central midfielder could also be on the agenda for Arsenal with Mohamed Elneny now less than two months away from becoming a free agent, but the Egypt international has impressed with showings against Chelsea and Manchester United in the past couple of weeks. © Reuters Elneny has confirmed his desire to sign a new contract at Arsenal, even if he remains a bit-part player under Arteta, who has also admitted that the ex-Basel man does not always get the credit he feels he deserves. Kieran Tierney's long-term injury and Nuno Tavares's hit-and-miss campaign could also lead Arsenal to move for a new left-back in the summer market, and Bologna's Aaron Hickey is also thought to be on their wanted list. However, the Scottish teenager - who supposedly possesses a €20m (£16.7m) price tag - is also rumoured to have attracted interest from Italian heavyweights Juventus, AC Milan and Napoli ahead of the summer window. Matteo Guendouzi, Lucas Torreira, Hector Bellerin, Konstantinos Mavropanos and Pablo Mari could also head elsewhere following the completion of their loan deals, but William Saliba is understood to have decided against a permanent move to Marseille as he fights for his spot in the defence alongside Ben White and Gabriel Magalhaes. Arsenal could temporarily drop out of the top four if Tottenham get the better of Leicester City on Sunday but will attempt to usurp their North London rivals when they meet West Ham United later in the day.

Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta had recently suggested that the Ghanaian's involvement this season was over as a result of the injury, before suggesting in recent days that his midfielder was progressing well in his recovery. Following Arsenal's 2-1 win at West Ham United on Sunday, the North London club posted a video of Gabriel's goal scored at the London Stadium on its official Twitter account. Partey then responded to the tweet on Monday with: ""Tom X Tom soon,"" with this possibly suggesting a link up with Arsenal full-back Takehiro Tomiyasu again in the coming weeks. Should Partey have made a quicker recovery than expected, he could feature in Arsenal's next game against Leeds United at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, with the Gunners leading Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United in the race for the Premier League top four as things stand.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-fc-romelu-lukaku-transfer-news-ac-milan-newcastle-b997605.html,Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku to reject AC Milan and Newcastle interest but Thomas Tuchel frustration growing,"omelu Lukaku will reject any interest from AC Milan this summer, placing fresh uncertainty over his future. The Chelsea striker also has no interest in Newcastle, one of the few teams seen as being able to afford his salary and transfer fee. The Belgium international’s position at Stamford Bridge is under intense scrutiny after being consigned to the fringes by Thomas Tuchel in recent months. He has made only one Premier League start since late February and was an unused substitute in Chelsea’s 1-0 defeat to Everton on Sunday. Lukaku has endured a miserable return to Chelsea after his club-record £97.5million move from Inter Milan last summer. He has struggled to adapt to Tuchel’s system, while injuries have also disrupted his campaign. Meanwhile, his relationship with his manager was strained by his decision to conduct an interview with Italian TV, in which he was critical of Tuchel’s system. While Chelsea’s head coach insisted the situation was resolved, Lukaku has largely been reduced to the role of substitute during the second half of the season. The player is growing increasingly frustrated by his lack of opportunities, with Tuchel’s decision not to use him at Goodison Park - despite being in desperate search of a goal - surprising sources close to Lukaku. It has been noted that he remains Chelsea’s joint second-highest goalscorer this season, despite his lack of starts and injury problems. Tuchel has publicly stated that it is down to Lukaku to prove he can lead his attack and live up to the expectations that accompanied his return to the club. But the German continues to select Kai Havertz ahead of him as a makeshift striker. That raises serious questions about Lukaku’s future, with major doubts over whether he can convince Tuchel to build his attack around him. Milan have emerged as a potential escape route but Lukaku would be reluctant to further upset Inter fans, who he made such an effort to appease with his ill-judged Sky Italia interview. Chelsea know there are few clubs who would be willing to offer them anything like the money they paid for Lukaku, which could block any chance of him moving on this summer. His wages, believed to be around £300,000-a-week, would rule out the vast majority of possible suitors. Romelu Lukaku has only made one Premier League start since February as his Chelsea struggles continue Newly-rich Newcastle were widely seen as one of the few clubs that would not be put off by the financial package required, even though it is unclear if they have any interest. But it is understood Lukaku would not entertain a move to St James’ Park. It remains to be seen what approach Chelsea’s new owners take with the former Manchester United player. While Roman Abramovich has largely been prepared to write off big-money signings, his successor may not. Todd Boehly, who is in exclusive talks to buy the club, has made it clear that he sees sports teams as investment opportunities. It is unlikely he would be comfortable with the most expensive player in the club’s history sitting on the bench. But the American is also believed to want Tuchel at the heart of his Chelsea revolution, which could mean more misery for Lukaku, whose preference is to stay and turn his fortunes around at the club he supported as a boy.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/christian-eriksen-transfer-news-brentford-tottenham-man-utd-b997610.html,Brentford confident over Christian Eriksen stay as Tottenham and Manchester United eye summer deal,"homas Frank believes Brentford “have a very good chance” of keeping Christian Eriksen beyond this season. Eriksen, who joined Brentford on a six-month deal in January, has been a revelation back in the Premier League and has helped propel the Bees away from the relegation zone. After proving he can still perform at his previous levels after recovering from a cardiac arrest while playing for Denmark last June, the 30-year-old midfielder is a target for rivals clubs. Tottenham are considering a move to re-sign Eriksen in the summer, while Manchester United and Newcastle have also been linked with a move for him. But Brentford are keen to extend his deal and believe they are in a strong position to keep him. Speaking after Brentford lost 3-0 against United at Old Trafford last night, Frank said: “I am always positive. I always believe we have a very good chance. I know he is happy here, he is enjoying his football. It is a decision that will be taken at the end of the season.” Asked how Brentford are trying to convince Eriksen to stay, Frank said: “Very simple, I speak to him. We are presenting our plans and discussing it back and forth.” Last night’s defeat leaves Brentford 14th in the Premier League table, eight points clear of the relegation zone.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/cristiano-ronaldo-future-man-utd-ralf-rangnick-b997571.html,Cristiano Ronaldo drops strong hint over Manchester United future amid Ralf Rangnick backing,"ristiano Ronaldo has seemingly hinted that he will be staying at Manchester United this summer. The Portugese superstar’s two-year contract at Old Trafford is not set to expire until June 2023, yet there has been fierce debate over recent months as to whether he should leave for a second time at the end of the season. While Ronaldo has proved United’s saviour on plenty of occasions with 24 goals in 38 appearances across all competitions this term, many have questioned his place in what is expected to be a drastic rebuild of the ailing Red Devils under new permanent manager Erik ten Hag. However, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner appeared to strongly hint that he would be staying put after again enjoying a starring role against Brentford in the Premier League on Monday night. Ronaldo is now only four strikes behind Liverpool leader Mohamed Salah in the Golden Boot race after dispatching a second-half penalty in the morale-boosting 3-0 victory over Brentford. He had earlier seen an initial effort ruled out for offside before the interval. Cristiano Ronaldo enjoyed a starring role again for Manchester United in their 3-0 win over Brentford After emphatically scoring his spot-kick, Ronaldo pointed to himself and then down to the Old Trafford turf, seemingly indicating that he may be staying after all. Then, while soaking up the adulation of the fans during a post-match lap of honour to mark the last home match of a difficult United campaign, he appeared to mouth to the Sky Sports cameras: “I’m not finished.” Interim boss Ralf Rangnick insisted once again after the win over Brentford that any decision on Ronaldo’s future should be deferred to Ten Hag, yet he backed the 37-year-old to remain part of the squad despite his repeated claims that United will need to sign at least two top-class strikers this summer. “The way we played again tonight, not only because he scored he also won the penalty and helped defensively, why should he not be part of the squad and help the team?” said Rangnick. “But this is a question you have to ask Erik and also Cristiano. “Cristiano is not a central striker. He does not want to play in that position but if you look at international football there are not many teams who play with two strikers. “For me, it is a question of what players Manchester United have in the future. It is obvious United need two more quality strikers. Modern strikers do not necessarily have to be strikers. Liverpool or Manchester City have five or six top-class strikers. If you ask me if Gabriel Jesus or Jack Grealish is a winger or a striker, they can all play there. “Mason Greenwood would have been one, then after the West Ham game he was no longer part of the squad. Anthony Martial was on loan and Edinson Cavani injured.” ",positive,manchester united,3

Spurs face a daunting trip to quadruple-chasing Liverpool on Saturday evening before Arsenal host Leeds, who have been dragged into the thick of a three-way relegation fight. With a two-point lead over their bitter rivals, fourth-placed Arsenal will be the more comfortable of the two, and this weekend offers them a good chance to open up a five-point gap on Spurs and potentially a cushion going into the north London derby at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Thursday week. But this is merely a scrap for fourth place, quite different to the relentless nature of the title race between Liverpool and Manchester City. Neither Arsenal nor Spurs have shown enough consistency this season to suggest they are certain to win their three other fixtures, so there should be more twists to come. If Spurs have an X-factor, it is their world-class individuals. In head coach Antonio Conte, they have one of the game’s best, while Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester was made comfortable by the brilliance of Harry Kane, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski at one end and Cristian Romero at the other. Arsenal, by contrast, are lacking the same star quality but feel like a more rounded team under Mikel Arteta, further along in their rebuild than their neighbours. Last month, Brighton and Brentford offered a blueprint of how to nullify Conte’s Spurs — specifically, deny them space in the final third and stop Kane getting on the ball — and, in having a more clearly-defined system, Arsenal are harder to stop and better at breaking down stubborn opponents. Arteta is also getting more from his squad than Conte, and important performances from fringe players Mohamed Elneny, Eddie Nketiah and Rob Holding in the wins over Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham point to a united group, with deceptive depth. By contrast, Lucas Moura was hopelessly rusty on his first Spurs start since mid-February on Sunday, while Harry Winks was off the pace in a late cameo, hardly surprisingly given Conte has barely changed his XI for over two months. Both clubs have been impacted by injuries in the same positions, with Spurs losing midfielder Oliver Skipp and wing-back Matt Doherty, and Arsenal without Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney in similar positions. Mikel Arteta vs Antonio Conte - who will win the race for Champions League qualification? The absences may prove crucial in the run-in. In Nuno Tavares, who is deputising for Tierney at left wing-back, Arsenal have an agent of chaos, and while the Portuguese is in the team there is a chance they will drop points in any game. Kulusevski, who came off the bench to twice assist Son on Sunday, should have the beating of Tavares if they both start on May 12. For all their star quality up front, Spurs, though, are weak on both flanks. In the absence of Doherty and Sergio Reguilon, who is sidelined indefinitely with a groin injury, wing-backs Emerson Royal and Ryan Sessegnon failed to make an impact in the final third against Leicester. But it is long past the point where Conte is likely to change his system or experiment on the flanks. If Arsenal allow Spurs’ wing-backs to have the ball, and keep it away from their forwards, they will be in a strong position next week. Spurs finish the season against Burnley, who are likely to be fighting for survival, and already-relegated Norwich, while Arsenal face a tough trip to Newcastle and host Everton on the final day, when the Toffees may also be playing for their Premier League status. The derby will surely be crucial, but the fight for Champions League football could come down to Spurs’ individual brilliance against Arsenal’s collective cohesion and unity. Whatever happens in the next fortnight, expect the contest to go the wire. ",positive,manchester united,1

Arsenal are currently sat fourth in the Premier League table, two points ahead of Spurs in fifth with four games left to play this season. The rivals are set to go head to head a week on Thursday (May 12) in a match that is being billed as one of the biggest north London derbies in recent history. Holding admits the Arsenal squad are well aware that game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium will have a huge say on who qualifies for the Champions League, but the centre-back has also urged his team-mates not to allow it to distract them as Leeds visit the Emirates on Sunday. “We have got to take it a game at a time,” Holding told Standard Sport, when asked about the north London derby. “Obviously we have got Leeds at the weekend and that’s always an intense game. “They come and bring energy. It will be a tough game, but we are at home with the fans behind us and we can try to chalk up another three points. Rob Holding has warned Arsenal not to look past Leeds with a crucial north London derby looming “Then the following week on the Thursday we have Tottenham, so that’s what it’ll come down to and it should be a good game.” Arsenal and Tottenham have been neck and neck in the top-four race, and they momentarily swapped places on Sunday after Spurs beat Leicester in the early kick-off. The Gunners responded by defeating West Ham and have now won three games on the spin after initially losing the same number of matches at the start of April. Those wins have come against Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham, with Holding partly putting the turnaround down to Arsenal supporters sticking by the team during a difficult spell. “I think since Mikel [Arteta] has come in there has been a big change in mentality and connecting with the fans,” he said. “I think on Sunday the fans were amazing again and they have been for the last couple of weeks, in terms of away games and at home. “That’s why our results have been decent since those three that we lost. We bounced back and they stuck by us. It could have been an easy point to turn on us, but they stuck by us and we’ve had three good results now.” ",negative,manchester united,1

The 29-year-old is not expected to agree a late extension and will seek a new club at the end of the season having made just four starts for United across all competitions so far this term. Lingard will be one of a number of players departing as the Erik ten Hag era begins, with the likes of Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Edinson Cavani and Juan Mata also set to exit.

Unlike so many games this season in which Ronaldo’s goals have papered over the cracks, the 37-year-old proved instrumental in the win even aside from both winning and penalty. At times, Ronaldo was even tracking back in order to win the ball before combining with Bruno Fernandes, Juan Mata and Anthony Elanga in a manner United fans have not seen before this season. Granted, the fact Brentford are not playing for much has to be taken into account but United resembled something of a cohesive attacking unit at times, all while dealing with Christian Eriksen’s delicious deliveries well from a defensive point of view. Fernandes opened the scoring following an Elanga cross after the youngster broke behind the Brentford defence in the opening ten minutes before Mata teed up Ronaldo for another goal on the break. That, however, was chalked off by VAR after an offside call and United went into the interval with only a one goal lead. From there, United really stepped up a gear. Led by Ronaldo, both Mata and Nemanja Matic also impressed on what is definitely their final appearances as a United player on home soil. Raphael Varane would sweep home a third as supporters bid farewell a number of players, not many of whom have lived up to their billing. In many ways, it was a strange, somewhat of testimonial-like atmosphere. A game that really did not matter, the handbrake was off and at least some of the negativity was lifted as Mata, Matic and Edisnon Cavani were applauded off the United stage.

The influential Bardsley, who turns 38 in October, will call time on an impressive career spanning two decades at the end of the current Women’s Super League (WSL) campaign. “It was obviously a pretty tough decision for me to make but, after a lot of deliberation and unfortunately being away from the pitch for quite a while now due to injury, it just felt like it was the right moment,” she said on Monday. “As sad and strange as it is to be stepping away from something I’ve committed my entire young adult life to, ultimately it’s something I feel really proud of and I can honestly say, hand on heart, that I’ve left no stone unturned and I have no regrets about how I’ve applied myself and what I’ve achieved. “I feel incredibly proud of my career but ultimately I’m really excited about the next steps and what is to come in the future, and I’m just very much looking forward to giving back to the football community in many other ways.” SPONSORED The American-born Bardsley has 81 senior England caps to her name, featuring in three World Cups and two European Championships. She also played at London 2012 for Great Britain and was part of Hege Riise’s initial squad for last summer’s delayed Tokyo Olympics, though was forced to withdraw through injury. Bardsley, who played college soccer for the Cal State Fullerton Titans, began her club career in the United States, playing for Ajax America Women, Pali Blues and Sky Blue FC before moving to Europe with Swedish outfit Linköpings. She first arrived in English football with Lincoln in 2013, joining Manchester City a year later ahead of their debut season in the WSL. Bardsley won the WSL title with City in 2016, plus four League Cups and three FA Cups. With the Lionesses, the 37-year-old was a member of the squad that finished third at the 2015 World Cup in Canada, also lifting the Cyprus Cup twice and the SheBelieves Cup in the USA in 2019. Manchester United’s Mary Earps has now established herself as England’s first-choice goalkeeper under Sarina Wiegman ahead of this summer’s delayed home Euros, with competition from Bardsley’s City team-mate Ellie Roebuck and Aston Villa’s Hannah Hampton.

The Red Devils are set for another comprehensive reset at the end of a dismal campaign, with Erik ten Hag leaving Ajax to take over the managerial reins after being preferred to Paris Saint-Germain boss Mauricio Pochettino. Interim boss Rangnick is also set to remain as planned in a consultancy role, which he is set to combine with duties as the new head coach of the Austrian national team. United will require major surgery in the transfer market once Ten Hag is on board, with a drastic squad overhaul required to address problems all over the pitch and the likes of Paul Pogba, Edinson Cavani, Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata all expected to depart. Ronaldo has been the saviour for United on several occasions since his sensational return to the club last summer, though there remains a debate over the 37-year-old’s future in such a rebuild. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner has another year remaining on his contract, though Rangnick said it is up to Ten Hag to make a decision on Ronaldo as he stressed the need for United to significantly strengthen their forward department for next season regardless. “This is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag,” Rangnick told Sky Sports of Ronaldo ahead of Monday night’s Premier League visit of Brentford. “He’s showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it’s obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, it’s pretty obvious.” Rangnick has still yet to speak to Ten Hag since the Dutchman was last month confirmed as United’s fifth permanent manager since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013. It remains to be seen if Cristiano Ronaldo will be part of the Erik ten Hag era at Manchester United However, he is expecting to sit down with his successor once the respective English and Dutch seasons have concluded, with United now embroiled in a fierce fight just to make the top six and Ajax on track for another Eredivisie title but denied a potential double following defeat by rivals PSV Eindhoven in the Dutch Cup Final. Rangnick said: ""I'm pretty sure he's got my phone number! He's got another couple of games to play with Ajax, we have another three games to play here. Whenever he wants to speak with me and exchange our opinions, I'm more than happy to do that."" ",positive,manchester united,2
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-rob-holding-mikel-arteta-mohamed-elneny-b997441.html,Arsenal: Unlikely heroes emerge as Mikel Arteta’s young side regain control of Champions League battle,"or much of Arsenal’s season their young players have been centre stage, but this recent revival has seen other unlikely protagonists step forward. After losing to Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton, few would have predicted Arsenal would then beat Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham in quick succession. Nor would many have called that the likes of Eddie Nketiah and Mohamed Elneny would be at the heart of those wins. Against West Ham, it was the turn of Rob Holding to emerge as an unlikely hero as he helped Arsenal battle to a 2-1 win. It was not a great performance from the Gunners and even manager Mikel Arteta described it as “ugly”, but they dug deep to grind out the result and no one embodied that gritty effort more than Holding. The centre-back has been on the periphery this season, playing second fiddle to Ben White and Gabriel and essentially taking on the role of defensive super-sub when Arsenal need to see out a game. ‘Smash glass here in case of emergency’, more or less. For this trip to West Ham, however, Holding was given the chance to start due to White being out injured with a tight hamstring. Holding seized his chance, opening the scoring with a header from a corner before throwing his body on the line as Arsenal held on to their slender lead. “The contribution that he (Holding) is having in terms of minutes is not very noticeable, but the contribution he has for the team is huge,” said Arteta. “He needs some praise. “He is someone like Mo [Elneny]. He is the same type of character, same type of person, that is just humble, just wants to give to the team and is happy with the success. When you ask him to play, he is always ready to do it.” It says a lot about the spirit at Arsenal that Holding and Elneny have barely played this season, but have come in and contributed at the most crucial time. Rob Holding and Mohamed Elneny remain crucial for Arsenal despite a lack of regular games Keeping players happy has not always been easy for Arteta but, even if this slimmed down squad has caused him problems, it has also allowed him to create a greater sense of unity. Holding has played his part in that and it is telling that he is a member of the leadership group, despite not being a regular starter. Off the pitch he has a strong influence in the dressing room and is valued by Arteta, acting as one of his trusted lieutenants. Having a strong first XI is naturally crucial to success, but the role of the squad cannot be overlooked and it has caused issues in the past at Arsenal. Holding’s goal and defensive efforts were pivotal in sealing an important win at West Ham The dressing room has not always been the happiest of places, however it is noticeable now how those on the sidelines seem fully on board, even if they only have limited chances to play. “It’s what it’s been like, Ben and Gabi have been great all year and when I’ve had to come on and try and help us secure the three points it’s vital for us, so to play the full 90 and get the three points is even better,” said Holding. Arsenal’s squad clearly needs strengthening and depth added, but, like last summer, making sure the right characters are signed will be key. In Holding, Arteta has someone who emphatically ticks that box. ",positive,manchester united,1

Tomiyasu made his first Premier League start since January following a lenghty calf problem but was replaced by Cedric Soares after pulling up injured in the 78th minute. Saka, meanwhile, was brought off for Emile Smith Rowe for the final few minutes at the London Stadium and looked to be in some discomfort in the closing stages. Ben White missed the game with a tight hamstring, although it is hoped his problem is not serious. Arteta, who has already lost Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey to injury problems during the run-in, provided a positive update on his players after the game. “Ben got injured against Manchester United, he felt a muscular problem and we checked him, and we will have to assess him in the next few days to see how he is,” he said. “Bukayo was fine, he was really fatigued and he has been through a little injury as well. Tomiyasu has just that he had been out for so long and could not continue.” Arsenal are next in action when they host Leeds United on Sunday, a day after top four rivals Tottenham travel to Liverpool. The two north London heavyweights will then meet on Thursday May 12 in what looks like a straight shootout to determine who qualifies for next season’s Champions League.

Pulisic has been limited to only 10 Premier League starts this season with Thomas Tuchel preferring the likes of Timo Werner, Kai Havertz and Mason Mount in attacking areas. With Romelu Lukaku and Hakim Ziyech also in the mix, Tuchel boasts some formidable firepower on paper. Still, his side missed a number of chances during Thursday’s draw against Manchester United and drew a blank away at Everton on Sunday, with Richarlison’s 46th-minute goal proving the difference at Goodison Park. Pulisic, despite scoring a late winning goal against West Ham last week, was only brought for the final twenty minutes of both games. The American international, signed for almost £60m from Borussia Dortmund in 2019, has just over two years left on his contract at Stamford Bridge. “The sad thing is he loves this club, teammates, and London.… puts his heart and soul into being a pro,” wrote father Mark on Twitter. “Onwards and upwards my boy…big 6 months ahead..” ",positive,manchester united,1

Pernille Harder coverted a late penalty to claim a hard-fought three points for Emma Hayes’ side, who sit four points ahead of rivals Arsenal, who have only one game in hand. Earlier on Sunday, Arsenal had romped to a 7-0 win over Aston Villa to ramp up the pressure. Vivianne Miedema scored twice with powerful shots in the opening 13 minutes to send Arsenal in at 2-0 up at the break, and an own goal by Rachel Corsie seven minutes into the second half saw Villa crumble. Beth Mead, Lotte Wubben-Moy and Stina Blackstenius all got on the scoresheet before Parris smacked home a 90th-minute penalty to reach a half-century of league goals in the English top flight as the Gunners climbed to 49 points, one behind Chelsea. Arsenal face Tottenham Hotspur, who play Everton later on Sunday, in midweek before finishing their league campaign away to West Ham, while Chelsea meet Birmingham before taking on Manchester United in their final fixture. Manchester United cruised to a 3-0 win over West Ham United to climb back into third place above Manchester City, who thumped Brighton & Hove Albion 7-2 on Saturday. At the bottom of the table, Leicester grabbed a 0-0 draw with Reading for what may prove to be a vital point in the battle against relegation.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/thomas-tuchel-chelsea-premier-league-top-four-b997416.html,Thomas Tuchel admits Chelsea are ‘never safe’ in top-four race after Everton defeat,"homas Tuchel claims Chelsea are now in a battle to secure top four after just two wins in their last six Premier League games. A 1-0 defeat to Everton continued their shaky end of season form and threatens to drag them back towards to Tottenham and Arsenal in the fight for Champions League places. Tuchel criticised his defence for another costly error that gifted Richarlison the winning goal just after half time. But it was a day when his attack let him down once again – even if it required the brilliance of Jordan Pickford to get Everton over the line. Tuchel said: “I said this many weeks ago that I didn’t feel safe and we are never safe. By the way, if we are in a race for top one, top two or top four, no matter what the race, the last four games to only have four points will never be enough, no matter which race we are in. “We have to take care about ourselves. At the moment we don’t get the points when we play well and deserve more and we lose when we play okay. This is a bad mixture.” Cesar Azpilicueta was caught in possession by Richarlison, who fired the winner at the start of the second half. Tuchel has seen his side dominate possession against Manchester United and Everton in the space of three days, yet his team have only managed one goal and one point from those games. He insists the issue is in defence, not attack. “We knew what was coming and like in the last matches we struggled to have clean sheets,” he said. “In the last four we had one, against West Ham, it is the only win we have and I’m very disappointed. “What can I do? The ball is free, give a goal away, it is the worst thing that can happen to you in this atmosphere. It happens too often. We struggle to play without big mistakes and it is why we struggle to have results.” On his attack he added: “If there is something I can do I will try it, but if I knew about it I would have done it before. “For me the key is to have a clean sheet. Manchester United was a different game. More open, fluid. We finally scored late and conceded straight away. “For me this is more like the game against West Ham and we had a clean sheet and played without any big mistakes and that gives us the chance to score late. “If you install emotion and belief in a stadium like this, you struggle.” Everton fans tried to put Chelsea off by setting off fireworks outside the Liverpool Hilton hotel where they stayed on Saturday night. Tuchel said they did not affect him. “I personally woke up twice at 1am and 3am for one minute and after the noise. I turned around and kept on sleeping.” ",positive,manchester united,2
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-fc-pickford-everton-b997412.html,Magnificent Jordan Pickford display no excuse for Chelsea in latest lacklustre performance,"f not for Jordan Pickford, Chelsea would have won this match. But while the England goalkeeper was in Superman mode, it would be letting Thomas Tuchel’s side off the hook to suggest he was the overriding reason for Everton’s crucial 1-0 win. As inspired as he was, Chelsea were abject. They slept-walked through the first half at Goodison Park, stumbled into the traps Frank Lampard set – and, ultimately, got what they deserved. Absolutely nothing. Cesar Azpilicueta’s error at the start of the second half was seized on by Richarlison and may go a long way towards the Toffees’ Premier League survival. The roar from the home crowd that greeted every challenge won, every heroic moment from Pickford, and the final whistle - underlining just how significant a result this was. As for Chelsea, they felt ill-prepared for the fight they were in for, but – most worryingly for Tuchel – ill-prepared to capitalise on the dominance of the ball Lampard was clearly happy to concede. Chelsea’s manager simply must address this glaring weakness in his team if he is to have any hope of closing the gap to Manchester City and Liverpool next season. In back-to-back games in the North West this week – against Manchester United and Everton – they have bossed possession and chances created and walked away with one goal and one point from a possible six. That is not good enough for any team with realistic ambitions of the title. Which is why his claim that his defence is his biggest concern after these latest dropped points, may not sit too well with supporters. “If there is something I can do, I will try it, but if I knew about it I would have done it before,” Tuchel said. “For me the key is to have a clean sheet. The issue is that we don’t have enough clean sheets.” The ongoing lack of cohesion in his forward line, as well as lack of precision, has cost Chelsea too often this season and their manager cannot turn a blind eye to it. At this point it feels as much to do with personnel as the coaching. This is a problem that has been in place since Tuchel took charge 15 months ago, with the list of strikers who have failed to produce at the point of his attack stretching from Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud to Timo Werner and Romelu Lukaku. With Chelsea desperate for a goal with more than 20 minutes to go, Tuchel left £97.5million record signing Lukaku on the bench. That speaks volumes about the Belgian’s future – but also points to his manager’s failure to get a tune out of him. If a new centre forward is recruited this summer, would there be any confidence that he would thrive where a growing list of others have not? But it is not only the cutting edge. Where is Chelsea’s guile around the box to open up deep-lying defences? They too often rely on the width of Reece James or the injured Ben Chilwell - missing the sort of incisive, intricate football City and Liverpool produce. Mason Mount, deployed as a No10 again, is energetic, but at times his side need craft over graft. These are all areas Tuchel must look at if his side are to find another dimension. It was not until the second half, with Chelsea a goal behind and fortunate not to be two-down that they finally awoke from their slumber. Unfortunately for them, Pickford’s concentration levels were sharp despite his inaction. First the he tipped Mount’s effort from inside the box onto the post, with the ball rolling across to hit the other upright. From the rebound, Azpilicueta fired goalwards, but Pickford was there again to block. Moments later he was flying at the feet of Toni Rudiger to deny the Chelsea from close range – albeit with his face. He would not be beaten. Ruben Loftus-Cheek – one of Chelsea’s few players to try to open Everton up – struck from distance, only for Pickford to get a hand on it again. Even deep into stoppage time, substitute Mateo Kovacic was denied an equaliser when the keeper dived low to claw away from the bottom corner. Pickford celebrated every save like it was a goal – and so did the crowd. Chelsea’s fans, meanwhile, were given nothing to cheer. ",positive,manchester united,1

He is doing what he needs to do, and that is score goals. “His game is different now than it was before, but one thing is a constant, the goals.

Sancho remains absent for tonight’s Premier League visit of Brentford to Old Trafford due to tonsilitis, having also sat out Thursday’s 1-1 draw against Chelsea. And Rangnick believes the England winger could stay on the sidelines for all of United’s final three outings this term. “As it seems, Jadon might be out for the rest of the season with his tonsillitis so he will most likely be not available against Brentford,” the German said. “Since the last game is another three weeks to go against Crystal Palace, but for the next two games I think it is unlikely.

The 63-year-old will continue working on a consultancy basis with Manchester United once Erik Ten Hag replaces him as the club’s manager at the end of the season. Ten Hag was confirmed earlier this month. Rangnick arrived in Manchester with a glittering reputation for helping clubs shape a long-term strategy, although the German has failed to improve things at Old Trafford on a short-term basis. The PA news agency understands United have been supportive of Rangnick taking the job with Austria, with the advisory position always holding the option for the 63-year-old to take on parallel roles. “I will take over as national team manager of Austria at the end of the season but will continue my consultancy with Manchester United,” said Rangnick. “I’m really looking forward to playing my part in helping United become a real force again.” ",negative,manchester united,2
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-antonio-conte-top-four-b997102.html,Antonio Conte must use squad to freshen up stale Tottenham after pair of blanks,"ntonio Conte’s view of his Tottenham squad can be summed up by a phrase the head coach has used to explain his reluctance to make substitutions. “I look to the bench, then I look back to the pitch!” Conte has remarked to staff. Conte, in short, is not convinced by his options outside his first XI, and the only changes he has made in 12 matches have been forced by injuries at wing-back. Saturday’s frustrating 0-0 draw with Brentford perfectly demonstrated Conte’s unwillingness to turn to his bench. With Spurs needing a goal to match Arsenal’s earlier win over Manchester United, Conte’s first change was centre-half Davinson Sanchez for Ryan Sessegnon in the 74th minute, while he did not introduce Lucas Moura until four minutes from time. Steven Bergwijn remained unused, which was bizarre in the circumstances, particularly given the Dutchman’s heroics in the last meeting with Sunday’s opponents Leicester, who visit north London on the back of last night’s 1-1 home draw against Roma in the Europa Conference League. Substitute Bergwijn scored twice in stoppage-time as Spurs sensationally won 3-2, despite trailing in the 95th minute, at the King Power Stadium in January. There is a view from some at Spurs that Bergwijn being the match-winner that night may not have been entirely in the club’s best interests. His stunning late show effectively ensured it would be a PR disaster to sell him to Ajax in the final week of January, as Spurs were considering, but he has since played just 175 minutes in the League. Clearly, the club might have been better off selling him and doing a late deal for a wing-back or an attacker Conte really rates. The big issue with Conte’s reluctance to use his full squad is that his first XI quickly ran out of ideas and steam in the matches against Brighton and Brentford and, damningly, Spurs go into Sunday having not had a shot on target for over three hours. Graham Potter’s Seagulls may just have established a blueprint with which to stop Conte’s side — specifically, prevent Harry Kane from getting on the ball and deny the England captain, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski space in the final third. For all their encouraging progress under Conte, Spurs are still not much better at creating chances against canny opponents as they were under Jose Mourinho. Their wins over Leeds, Everton and West Ham came against sides who all adopted a gung-ho approach, while the thrashings of Aston Villa and Newcastle came after they had been outplayed in the first half but managed to establish a lead, before picking off an opponent who had to chase the game. Until he can make those signings, establishing a Plan B would be a start, but Conte is committed to his approach and appears reluctant to experiment. Among his options would be a switch to a back-four, with Bergwijn or Moura coming in at the expense of a defender, but this risks Spurs’ defensive solidity, which has remained intact. A more realistic move would be to bring either of the above into the front three and move Kulusevski to right wing-back, where the injured Matt Doherty is a miss, as Conte did for the final few minutes against Brentford. The risk there is that the connection between the midfield two and front three is further disrupted without link-man Kulusevski drifting between the thirds. Adding an extra midfield body in Harry Winks is another possibility. The good news for Conte is that Spurs’ next three opponents — Leicester, Liverpool and Arsenal — all have coaches who prefer their teams to have possession and play on the front foot, which should suit the Italian’s approach of absorbing pressure and attacking the space. Conte, though, cannot continue to rely on opponents playing into his team’s hands if Spurs are to overhaul Arsenal again in the battle for fourth. ",positive,manchester united,1

The 37-year-old scored his 17th Premier League goal of the season on Thursday to rescue a point against Chelsea and his overall tally stands at 23 in 37 club appearances. United’s problems are surely more systemic than merely Ronaldo, who remains an elite goalscorer, but his signing has been criticised in some quarters as an example of the club being focused on superstar names rather than coherent strategy. The arrival of Erik Ten Hag this summer further muddies the waters. With the Dutchman needing to rebuild, it’s unclear as to whether or not Ronaldo will feature, or even if the Portugal international would wish to given United will likely miss out on Champions League qualification. Under contract until the summer of 2023, Ronaldo has previously hinted he does not want to be challenging for merely a place in the top four. Speaking after United’s draw with Chelsea, Rangnick said: “His attitude, he’s 37 - it’s not normal. If he plays like he did yesterday he can still be a big help to this team. “It’s ten Hag and also Cristiano’s decision for what he can do next, but his performance was great.” ",positive,manchester united,1

The first leg takes place at Anfield on Wednesday evening after Emery overcame European powerhouses in Juventus and Bayern Munich in the previous two rounds. A master of European competition after winning the Europa League on four different occasions across two clubs, Emery has tasted success against Klopp before. One of his Europa League victories came at Liverpool’s expense, beating Klopp’s side 3-1 while manager of Sevilla after a second-half comeback in the 2016 final. After overcoming two of the biggest names in the game - with those wins following up on the win over Manchester United in last season’s Europa League final - Emery is once again proving to be a master tactician in the game. Speaking in his pre-match press conference on Tuesday, Klopp paid tribute to the former Arsenal boss. “Unai is a detail-obsessed manager who prepares for all different situations in the game and that’s what his team is executing,” he said. “It’s really, really good, different ways to build-up, different ways to press, different ways to react on results. “He is a world class coach is doing an incredible job there. “Our job is to make life difficult as possible for them and that is what we will try and do over the two legs.” ",positive,manchester united,1

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/mino-raiola-football-super-agent-b997320.html,"Loved by players, the bane of top managers - Mino Raiola too powerful for football’s biggest names to ignore","ino Raiola’s influence on the world of football will be further underlined this summer. Two of the super agent’s most famous clients will be involved in arguably the most significant deals of the upcoming window. Erling Haaland is set to complete a move to Manchester City, while Paul Pogba will become a free agent and is set to walk away from Manchester United. By Raiola’s standards they will represent loose change in terms of the fees they generate – but will go down as two of the biggest deals in history. Haaland is available for £63million due to the buyout clause inserted by his representative when he moved to Borussia Dortmund in 2020. That paves the way to personal terms that have been reputed to be as high a £500,000-a-week. Pogba, meanwhile, will be in line for an enormous signing on fee when he walks away from Old Trafford, along with a weekly wage that will make him one of the highest-paid players in the world. No wonder Raiola’s clients are so fiercely loyal to him. The Italian always claimed his priority was to get the best deal for his clients like Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and they loved him for it. Managers and chief executives did not always feel the same. He felt the wrath of Sir Alex Ferguson after engineering Pogba’s exit from United as a free agent when one of the hottest prospects in the game in 2012. Ferguson wrote in his autobiography: “There are one or two football agents I simply do not like, and Mino Raiola is one of them. I distrusted him from the moment I met him. “He and I were like oil and water. From then on, our goose was cooked because Raiola had been able to ingratiate himself with Paul and his family and the player signed with Juventus.” His relationship with Pep Guardiola was even more fraught, with Raiola outspoken in his criticism of the Catalan over his treatment of Ibrahimovic when managing him at Barcelona. “If Guardiola doesn’t play Ibra after paying €75million for him, it’s best if you send him to a psychiatric hospital.” He later claimed to have confronted Guardiola after the Champions League Final in 2011. “I went for him that night in the corridors at Wembley,” he said. “Only Adriano Galliani stopped me. Lucky for Guardiola.” Raiola later said: “Pep Guardiola, the coach, is fantastic. As a person he’s an absolute zero. He’s a coward, a dog.” Given such personal enmity, it emphasises Raiola’s power that he was still prepared to work with him to bring in Haaland this summer. Likewise, United were prepared to do repeated business with him even after Ferguson’s experience. Pogba was brought back to Old Trafford for a then-world record £89million. Raiola was believed to have earned a staggering £41million from that deal. Ibrahimovic, Romelu Lukaku and Henrikh Mkhitaryan were other big money moves to United. And he hardly improved relations with the club or fans with his frequent public comments casting doubt over Pogba’s future. Guardiola famously claimed Raiola even tried to engineer a move for the France midfielder to City. Raiola was simply too big to ignore – too powerful for any club to refuse to do business with. And City’s impending deal for Haaland is the greatest evidence for that. It is also a further example of the brash Italian’s careful management of his clients. Haaland could have joined United back in 2020, when the player’s mentor, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, made such a strong bid to bring him to Old Trafford. Instead, he rejected the possibility of the bigger move to further develop his game at Dortmund. Two and a half years on, Haaland is wanted by all the major clubs and can take his pick. He may just be Raiola’s legacy. ",positive,manchester united,1

In front of a sparse United crowd amid a fan protest against the Glazer ownership, Chelsea quickly settled into a good rhythm. Kai Havertz was guilty of squandering the visitors’ most significant openings in the first half, whipping a shot against the side netting after a breakaway before slapping a one-on-one shot against David De Gea’s shoulder. The goalkeeper was then able to deny a free header, straight at him, as Chelsea produced everything but a finish. Reece James and Mason Mount were enjoying the freedom of Manchester down the right and the midfielder attempted to prise open the deadlock with a whipped cross that beat De Gea, and Timo Werner, shortly after the break. Beforehand, Havertz had again wasted a good counter with a sloppy pass. SPONSORED It was no surprise when Marcos Alonso popped up, unmarked, to fire Chelsea ahead on the hour mark after another move down the right. But even the most optimistic of home fans would not have expected Cristiano Ronaldo to appear moments later and slam home a leveller, after good work from Nemanja Matic.

The Dutchman will take over in the summer after a poor period for the Red Devils under Ralf Rangnick, leading to Keane’s optimism that he will get a good view of the team ahead of his first day in the role. The ex-midfielder told Sky Sports ahead of the game with Chelsea on Thursday: “I think he’s a good appointment, there’s been a lot of speculation and the club will be glad to get the deal done - so he can start looking at the club and the background. “He’s got a solid CV, a very good reputation.

He’s fortunate coming in in the summer with five or six players on big contracts already leaving - that will help. “I think every United manager will get backing, he will get some money to spend but it’s about getting the right players and right characters into the club - what we’ve seen from this group of players that last few months has not been good enough.” ",positive,manchester united,1

If Monday night’s win over Brentford proves to be Cristiano Ronaldo’s final game in front of a home Manchester United support, one of the club’s greatest ever players can go out on a relative high. Unlike so many games this season in which Ronaldo’s goals have papered over the cracks, the 37-year-old proved instrumental in the win even aside from both winning and penalty. At times, Ronaldo was even tracking back in order to win the ball before combining with Bruno Fernandes, Juan Mata and Anthony Elanga in a manner United fans have not seen before this season. You can read our full match report here. Barely enough to make up for an awful season but at least Man United finish at home on a positive note. 71:00 - Varane scores his first Manchester United goal! His volley after Fernandes’ corner is deflected in. 70:00 - Matic brought off to a great reception. His final game at Old Trafford. 60:00 - Ronaldo has his goal! Brilliant overall performance. Ice-cool penalty, sending Raya the wrong way. 59:00 - Ronaldo wins a penalty, barging Rico Henry off the ball before the Brentford man hauls Ronaldo down. 57:00 - Crosses flying in now, causing United problems. The home side are dealing well but Eriksen only needs one chance to find his man. 54:00 - The only Brentford player to have caused problems. Brilliant to see. ",positive,manchester united,3

Dimitar Berbatov has stated that Cristiano Ronaldo could not be blamed for quitting Manchester United if the Red Devils fail to qualify for the Champions League. The 37-year-old has hit 23 goals this season as United’s leading scorer but the team is off the pace in the race for fourth place - leaving questions over his future at Old Trafford.

He is doing what he needs to do, and that is score goals. “His game is different now than it was before, but one thing is a constant, the goals. He still produces and scores which is so important. “He has one more year at United, which is a good thing in my opinion, and now it is down to him whether he stays or leaves.

Sancho remains absent for tonight’s Premier League visit of Brentford to Old Trafford due to tonsilitis, having also sat out Thursday’s 1-1 draw against Chelsea. And Rangnick believes the England winger could stay on the sidelines for all of United’s final three outings this term. “As it seems, Jadon might be out for the rest of the season with his tonsillitis so he will most likely be not available against Brentford,” the German said. “Since the last game is another three weeks to go against Crystal Palace, but for the next two games I think it is unlikely. SPONSORED “He definitely has an inflammation on his tonsils and has also had some high temperatures, that’s why he was not available for Chelsea and he almost certainly won’t be available for the next couple of games. ”So, hopefully, they can get hold of that inflammation and if the tonsils have to be taken out and removed, this can happen at the end of the season.” Harry Maguire, Paul Pogba and Luke Shaw remain out for United against Brentford, although Edinson Cavani is fit enough for the bench, alongside Fred.

The Manchester United forward has scored 17 goals in 28 Premier League games this season, trailing only Mohamed Salah at the top of charts despite widespread criticism of his suitability to the modern game. Ronaldo scored his first League goal against Chelsea on Thursday to rescue a point at Old Trafford and recently hit the 100 mark during a loss to Arsenal at the Emirates. Under contract until the summer of 2023, it is unclear whether the change of manager and the fact United are all but certain to be playing outside of the Champions League next season will have an impact on his future. ""This is something that we should speak about between Erik and the board and myself,"" Rangnick told reporters when asked about Ronaldo’s future. ""Cristiano has another year of contract.

Dele Alli to Everton, Christian Eriksen to Brentford and Philippe Coutinho were some of the most notable moves made. Here’s a full list of every incoming deal made by top-flight clubs in the January window. Just 16 months after signing a lucrative three-year contract and vowing to become an Arsenal legend, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left under a cloud, writes Simon Collings. Aubameyang was exiled by Mikel Arteta after being stripped of the captaincy following a disciplinary breach that ultimately led to a sad end to his time at Emirates Stadium. He has not played a minute since December, was dropped from the squad and Arteta said he failed to demonstrate the “commitment and passion” to play for the club. Clearly, their relationship was broken beyond repair. Read the full story here on the long-term thinking behind Arsenal’s bold decision. It’s the one we’ve been waiting for! Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s free transfer to Barcelona has officially been confirmed by Arsenal. Aubameyang was pictured arriving in Barcelona on Monday lunchtime, when the clubs were in talks over a potential loan move, but as reports emerged that the deal had broken down it was suggested he had only been in the Spanish city to visit family. However, the deal was revived late in the day as a permanent transfer, signalling the end of the forward’s Arsenal career. Read the full story here. Arsenal’s January transfer window was a tale of frustration and, ultimately, the failure to strengthen the squad will ramp up the pressure to spend in the summer, writes Standard Sport’s Simon Collings. Mikel Arteta was bullish throughout last month about the need for Arsenal to “maximise every window” and, while that may have been the case with outgoings, it wasn’t so with incomings. Read the full story. Chelsea have confirmed the signing of Mason Burstow from Charlton, with the teenager heading back to the Valley on loan. Read the full story. Dele Alli paid special tribute to Mauricio Pochettino as he bid farewell to Tottenham after seven years at the club. Everton signed the midfielder on an initial free transfer, which could reach £30million, on transfer deadline day. It ended Dele’s long association with Spurs, and he thanked the club and fans for their support. Notably, former boss Pochettino and his staff were thanked for their “trust and guidance” during the early part of his career in North London. He wrote on social media: “It’s the end of the chapter but not the book. Thank you all for the messages.” Read the full story. Newcastle confirm the loan exit of Jack Young to Wycombe on loan. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was pictured in Barcelona kit for the first time on Tuesday - as he underwent a training session before his move from Arsenal was officially announced.

Thomas Tuchel was left frustrated by the failure to cover Chelsea’s injury crisis during the January window, writes Standard Sport’s James Robson. But the German – who warned the season could be wrecked if no mid-season additions were made – will be boosted by the return of Reece James, Andreas Christensen and Trevoh Chalobah this month. Tuchel’s main priority was always to bring in longer-term targets if they became available in January. And the focus will be on stamping more of his mark on the squad in the summer, with a host names already identified. Read the full story. Barcelona president Joan Laporta has claimed that Ousmane Dembele has already found his next club after rejecting a move to the Premier League on deadline day. Chelsea were strongly linked with the French winger, who was available for a move after negotiations over a new Barcelona contract collapsed. Instead, he will now leave as a free agent in the summer. “The Dembele thing is difficult to understand,” Laporta told a press conference on Tuesday. “Dembele is in the team and Xavi has to build a competitive squad with players who have a future at this club. “We think that Dembele already has a contract with another club, they have insinuated that to us. What we will do is defend the interests of our club.” Read the full story. ",positive,manchester united,2

To expect anything in the way of wholesale changes during the arduous January market would be too much, although Conte is a man who does need satisfying. Having constantly spoken about needing to raise the level of the team, surely Spurs will be doing all they can to back him during what remains of this month. At least showing Conte there’s a chance to grow and a readiness to provide him with fresh options is of the utmost importance. If the the Italian does not feel there’s a willingness to rebuild the squad, perhaps the former Chelsea boss’ frustration will grow. With that in mind, here’s a look at the latest on Spurs’ transfer gossip. SPONSORED According to Fabrizio Romano, Spurs and Newcastle United have had loan offers for the forward snubbed. While Martial is believed to be looking for a way out of Old Trafford, it seems his future could lie abroad. Sevilla, Barcelona and Juventus are all said to be keen in what must be a blow for Spurs given Conte has called for a new addition in that department. Dan Kilpatrick has previously reported that Fabio Paratici is actively looking to sell the midfielder. Conte has been rather cutting in his assessment of the Frenchman and, after being booed off against Morecambe in the FA Cup, it’s very hard to see a way back for him. Still, finding a buyer this month is likely to be difficult. Perhaps the major name to have been linked with Spurs this month, Wolves have snubbed a £15m offer for the player and are holding out for £20m, It remains to be seen if Spurs will go that far. Given Pierluigi Gollini has barely covered himself in glory and Hugo Lloris is yet to extend his contract, a new goalkeeper could be needed at Spurs. Earlier this month, the MEN reported that Spurs were keen on a move for Manchester United’s Dean Henderson, although Ralf Rangnick has since stressed he’s looking to keep the England hopeful despite his lack of first-team minutes.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang joined Barcelona on a free transfer, with an announcement expected on Tuesday morning. Ousmane Dembele was linked with both Chelsea and Manchester United in recent days, with reports suggesting a move to PSG has broken down, but will stay at Barcelona.

There were no incomings as expected at Crystal Palace, though they have made Jean-Philippe Mateta’s move a permanent one. Donny van de Beek has joined Everton, while West Ham‘s hopes of re-signing Jesse Lingard are over, with Man United not willing to let him leave this month. Newcastle have signed Brighton defender Dan Burn before the deadline but their move for Hugo Ekitike has collapsed. In the other major done deals of the day, Manchester City have landed Julian Alvarez, Rangers have signed Aaron Ramsey on loan and Christian Eriksen has joined Brentford for six months. Follow transfer deadline day LIVE with Standard Sport’s blog below! It’s been a long month and there’s been plenty to keep track of in the Premier League. Dele Alli to Everton, Christian Eriksen to Brentford and Philippe Coutinho were some of the most notable moves made. Here’s a full list of every incoming deal made by top-flight clubs in the January window. Just 16 months after signing a lucrative three-year contract and vowing to become an Arsenal legend, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left under a cloud, writes Simon Collings. Aubameyang was exiled by Mikel Arteta after being stripped of the captaincy following a disciplinary breach that ultimately led to a sad end to his time at Emirates Stadium. He has not played a minute since December, was dropped from the squad and Arteta said he failed to demonstrate the “commitment and passion” to play for the club. Clearly, their relationship was broken beyond repair. Read the full story here on the long-term thinking behind Arsenal’s bold decision. It’s the one we’ve been waiting for! Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s free transfer to Barcelona has officially been confirmed by Arsenal. Aubameyang was pictured arriving in Barcelona on Monday lunchtime, when the clubs were in talks over a potential loan move, but as reports emerged that the deal had broken down it was suggested he had only been in the Spanish city to visit family. However, the deal was revived late in the day as a permanent transfer, signalling the end of the forward’s Arsenal career. Read the full story here. Arsenal’s January transfer window was a tale of frustration and, ultimately, the failure to strengthen the squad will ramp up the pressure to spend in the summer, writes Standard Sport’s Simon Collings. Mikel Arteta was bullish throughout last month about the need for Arsenal to “maximise every window” and, while that may have been the case with outgoings, it wasn’t so with incomings.

Dele Alli paid special tribute to Mauricio Pochettino as he bid farewell to Tottenham after seven years at the club. Everton signed the midfielder on an initial free transfer, which could reach £30million, on transfer deadline day. It ended Dele’s long association with Spurs, and he thanked the club and fans for their support. Notably, former boss Pochettino and his staff were thanked for their “trust and guidance” during the early part of his career in North London. He wrote on social media: “It’s the end of the chapter but not the book. Thank you all for the messages.” Read the full story. Newcastle confirm the loan exit of Jack Young to Wycombe on loan.

Thomas Tuchel was left frustrated by the failure to cover Chelsea’s injury crisis during the January window, writes Standard Sport’s James Robson. But the German – who warned the season could be wrecked if no mid-season additions were made – will be boosted by the return of Reece James, Andreas Christensen and Trevoh Chalobah this month. Tuchel’s main priority was always to bring in longer-term targets if they became available in January. And the focus will be on stamping more of his mark on the squad in the summer, with a host names already identified. Read the full story. Barcelona president Joan Laporta has claimed that Ousmane Dembele has already found his next club after rejecting a move to the Premier League on deadline day. Chelsea were strongly linked with the French winger, who was available for a move after negotiations over a new Barcelona contract collapsed. Instead, he will now leave as a free agent in the summer. “The Dembele thing is difficult to understand,” Laporta told a press conference on Tuesday. “Dembele is in the team and Xavi has to build a competitive squad with players who have a future at this club. “We think that Dembele already has a contract with another club, they have insinuated that to us. What we will do is defend the interests of our club.” Read the full story. ",positive,manchester united,2

The deal would see Dele initially head to Goodison Park on a free transfer, with a £10m fee due to Tottenham after he makes 20 appearances. The fee could eventually rise to £30m depending on performance. The Toffees confirmed Frank Lampard as their new manager on Monday afternoon and within hours of his appointment the former Chelsea boss was hopeful of making Dele his first official signing. Everton have already wrapped up the loan signing of Donny van de Beek from Manchester United, with Lampard's approval. Spurs were expecting to loan out Dele this month but Everton used their final loan spot on Van de Beek and can only pursue a permanent deal. Dele joined Spurs from MK Dons in summer 2015 and established himself as one of the most exciting young players in Europe but he gradually fallen from favour in the last few years, and struggled under all three managers since Mauricio Pochettino was sacked. Newcastle were expected to come in for Dele this month but that never materialised. He has made just seven Premier League appearances for Tottenham this season and Antonio Conte made it clear he was available for transfer in January. In total, Dele has played 269 games for Spurs and scored 67 goals. ",positive,manchester united,1

Manchester City, meanwhile, eased to a 4-0 vwin over Leicester City. Chelsea, who had a one-point lead over second-placed Arsenal coming into the game, went behind early through a Sophie Ingle own goal in the 15th minute before Guro Reiten levelled with a left-footed finish from a tight angle 12 minutes later. The Gunners closed that gap quickly, with Beth Mead and Jordan Nobbs both netting their 50th WSL goals en route to a comfortable win over Everton to move to 46 points with three games left to play. Chelsea keeper Ann-Katrin Berger was sent off before the break for a challenge on Rachel Williams but the champions managed to grab a second goal when Sam Kerr turned in a Jonna Andersson cross in the 71st minute, and Jessie Fleming added a late third. SPONSORED First-half goals from Caroline Weir, Lauren Hemp and Julie Blakstad gave City a commanding home win against Leicester, with Alex Greenwood adding a fourth from the spot to compete the rout. City are third in the WSL standings on 38 points, five adrift of Arsenal, who travel to Everton later on Sunday. Aston Villa host Manchester United in the other late kick-off. Earlier, Emma Snerle and Yui Hasegawa were on target as West Ham United secured a 2-1 win over Reading, who netted a late consolation through Faye Bryson.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-vs-tottenham-top-four-battle-unity-individual-brilliance-b997665.html,Arsenal vs Tottenham: Why top-four battle will come down to unity against individual brilliance as derby looms,"op-four-chasing Arsenal and Tottenham both benefited from playing opponents with one eye on midweek European fixtures on Sunday — but neither will be so fortunate this weekend. Spurs face a daunting trip to quadruple-chasing Liverpool on Saturday evening before Arsenal host Leeds, who have been dragged into the thick of a three-way relegation fight. With a two-point lead over their bitter rivals, fourth-placed Arsenal will be the more comfortable of the two, and this weekend offers them a good chance to open up a five-point gap on Spurs and potentially a cushion going into the north London derby at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Thursday week. But this is merely a scrap for fourth place, quite different to the relentless nature of the title race between Liverpool and Manchester City. Neither Arsenal nor Spurs have shown enough consistency this season to suggest they are certain to win their three other fixtures, so there should be more twists to come. If Spurs have an X-factor, it is their world-class individuals. In head coach Antonio Conte, they have one of the game’s best, while Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester was made comfortable by the brilliance of Harry Kane, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski at one end and Cristian Romero at the other. Arsenal, by contrast, are lacking the same star quality but feel like a more rounded team under Mikel Arteta, further along in their rebuild than their neighbours. Last month, Brighton and Brentford offered a blueprint of how to nullify Conte’s Spurs — specifically, deny them space in the final third and stop Kane getting on the ball — and, in having a more clearly-defined system, Arsenal are harder to stop and better at breaking down stubborn opponents. Arteta is also getting more from his squad than Conte, and important performances from fringe players Mohamed Elneny, Eddie Nketiah and Rob Holding in the wins over Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham point to a united group, with deceptive depth. By contrast, Lucas Moura was hopelessly rusty on his first Spurs start since mid-February on Sunday, while Harry Winks was off the pace in a late cameo, hardly surprisingly given Conte has barely changed his XI for over two months. Both clubs have been impacted by injuries in the same positions, with Spurs losing midfielder Oliver Skipp and wing-back Matt Doherty, and Arsenal without Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney in similar positions. Mikel Arteta vs Antonio Conte - who will win the race for Champions League qualification? The absences may prove crucial in the run-in. In Nuno Tavares, who is deputising for Tierney at left wing-back, Arsenal have an agent of chaos, and while the Portuguese is in the team there is a chance they will drop points in any game. Kulusevski, who came off the bench to twice assist Son on Sunday, should have the beating of Tavares if they both start on May 12. For all their star quality up front, Spurs, though, are weak on both flanks. In the absence of Doherty and Sergio Reguilon, who is sidelined indefinitely with a groin injury, wing-backs Emerson Royal and Ryan Sessegnon failed to make an impact in the final third against Leicester. But it is long past the point where Conte is likely to change his system or experiment on the flanks. If Arsenal allow Spurs’ wing-backs to have the ball, and keep it away from their forwards, they will be in a strong position next week. Spurs finish the season against Burnley, who are likely to be fighting for survival, and already-relegated Norwich, while Arsenal face a tough trip to Newcastle and host Everton on the final day, when the Toffees may also be playing for their Premier League status. The derby will surely be crucial, but the fight for Champions League football could come down to Spurs’ individual brilliance against Arsenal’s collective cohesion and unity. Whatever happens in the next fortnight, expect the contest to go the wire. ",positive,manchester united,1
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-fc-romelu-lukaku-transfer-news-ac-milan-newcastle-b997605.html,Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku to reject AC Milan and Newcastle interest but Thomas Tuchel frustration growing,"omelu Lukaku will reject any interest from AC Milan this summer, placing fresh uncertainty over his future. The Chelsea striker also has no interest in Newcastle, one of the few teams seen as being able to afford his salary and transfer fee. The Belgium international’s position at Stamford Bridge is under intense scrutiny after being consigned to the fringes by Thomas Tuchel in recent months. He has made only one Premier League start since late February and was an unused substitute in Chelsea’s 1-0 defeat to Everton on Sunday. Lukaku has endured a miserable return to Chelsea after his club-record £97.5million move from Inter Milan last summer. He has struggled to adapt to Tuchel’s system, while injuries have also disrupted his campaign. Meanwhile, his relationship with his manager was strained by his decision to conduct an interview with Italian TV, in which he was critical of Tuchel’s system. While Chelsea’s head coach insisted the situation was resolved, Lukaku has largely been reduced to the role of substitute during the second half of the season. The player is growing increasingly frustrated by his lack of opportunities, with Tuchel’s decision not to use him at Goodison Park - despite being in desperate search of a goal - surprising sources close to Lukaku. It has been noted that he remains Chelsea’s joint second-highest goalscorer this season, despite his lack of starts and injury problems. Tuchel has publicly stated that it is down to Lukaku to prove he can lead his attack and live up to the expectations that accompanied his return to the club. But the German continues to select Kai Havertz ahead of him as a makeshift striker. That raises serious questions about Lukaku’s future, with major doubts over whether he can convince Tuchel to build his attack around him. Milan have emerged as a potential escape route but Lukaku would be reluctant to further upset Inter fans, who he made such an effort to appease with his ill-judged Sky Italia interview. Chelsea know there are few clubs who would be willing to offer them anything like the money they paid for Lukaku, which could block any chance of him moving on this summer. His wages, believed to be around £300,000-a-week, would rule out the vast majority of possible suitors. Romelu Lukaku has only made one Premier League start since February as his Chelsea struggles continue Newly-rich Newcastle were widely seen as one of the few clubs that would not be put off by the financial package required, even though it is unclear if they have any interest. But it is understood Lukaku would not entertain a move to St James’ Park. It remains to be seen what approach Chelsea’s new owners take with the former Manchester United player. While Roman Abramovich has largely been prepared to write off big-money signings, his successor may not. Todd Boehly, who is in exclusive talks to buy the club, has made it clear that he sees sports teams as investment opportunities. It is unlikely he would be comfortable with the most expensive player in the club’s history sitting on the bench. But the American is also believed to want Tuchel at the heart of his Chelsea revolution, which could mean more misery for Lukaku, whose preference is to stay and turn his fortunes around at the club he supported as a boy.

Eriksen, who joined Brentford on a six-month deal in January, has been a revelation back in the Premier League and has helped propel the Bees away from the relegation zone. After proving he can still perform at his previous levels after recovering from a cardiac arrest while playing for Denmark last June, the 30-year-old midfielder is a target for rivals clubs. Tottenham are considering a move to re-sign Eriksen in the summer, while Manchester United and Newcastle have also been linked with a move for him. But Brentford are keen to extend his deal and believe they are in a strong position to keep him. Speaking after Brentford lost 3-0 against United at Old Trafford last night, Frank said: “I am always positive. I always believe we have a very good chance. I know he is happy here, he is enjoying his football. It is a decision that will be taken at the end of the season.” Asked how Brentford are trying to convince Eriksen to stay, Frank said: “Very simple, I speak to him. We are presenting our plans and discussing it back and forth.” Last night’s defeat leaves Brentford 14th in the Premier League table, eight points clear of the relegation zone.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-tottenham-north-london-derby-rob-holding-b997628.html,Rob Holding urges Arsenal not be distracted by crucial Tottenham derby with Leeds clash up first,"ob Holding has warned his Arsenal team-mates not to get distracted by next week’s Champions League decider against Tottenham ahead of their meeting with Leeds. Arsenal are currently sat fourth in the Premier League table, two points ahead of Spurs in fifth with four games left to play this season. The rivals are set to go head to head a week on Thursday (May 12) in a match that is being billed as one of the biggest north London derbies in recent history. Holding admits the Arsenal squad are well aware that game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium will have a huge say on who qualifies for the Champions League, but the centre-back has also urged his team-mates not to allow it to distract them as Leeds visit the Emirates on Sunday. “We have got to take it a game at a time,” Holding told Standard Sport, when asked about the north London derby. “Obviously we have got Leeds at the weekend and that’s always an intense game. “They come and bring energy. It will be a tough game, but we are at home with the fans behind us and we can try to chalk up another three points. Rob Holding has warned Arsenal not to look past Leeds with a crucial north London derby looming “Then the following week on the Thursday we have Tottenham, so that’s what it’ll come down to and it should be a good game.” Arsenal and Tottenham have been neck and neck in the top-four race, and they momentarily swapped places on Sunday after Spurs beat Leicester in the early kick-off. The Gunners responded by defeating West Ham and have now won three games on the spin after initially losing the same number of matches at the start of April. Those wins have come against Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham, with Holding partly putting the turnaround down to Arsenal supporters sticking by the team during a difficult spell. “I think since Mikel [Arteta] has come in there has been a big change in mentality and connecting with the fans,” he said. “I think on Sunday the fans were amazing again and they have been for the last couple of weeks, in terms of away games and at home. “That’s why our results have been decent since those three that we lost. We bounced back and they stuck by us. It could have been an easy point to turn on us, but they stuck by us and we’ve had three good results now.” ",negative,manchester united,1

Academy graduate Lingard’s 22-year association with the Red Devils is set to come to an end when his current Old Trafford contract expires this summer. The 29-year-old is not expected to agree a late extension and will seek a new club at the end of the season having made just four starts for United across all competitions so far this term. Lingard will be one of a number of players departing as the Erik ten Hag era begins, with the likes of Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Edinson Cavani and Juan Mata also set to exit. The England international was an unused substitute on Monday night as United picked up a morale-boosting 3-0 Premier League victory over Brentford in interim manager Ralf Rangnick’s final home match in charge. Jesse Lingard will leave Manchester United when his contract expires at the end of the season That victory saw United tighten their grip on sixth place ahead of West Ham and the players embark on a post-match lap of honour following a difficult campaign, though Lingard’s brother was evidently furious by the lack of a proper send-off for Lingard. Louie Scott reportedly posted on his private Instagram story: “20 years of blood sweat and tears, 4 domestic trophies, 3 cup final goals, not even a farewell. No wonder it’s Conference League next year.” He added: “Attacking players for celebrations when the clubs [sic] being sold to the super league ok. Class of 92, Busby Babes, you’re ran by people who don’t even know the offside trap. Classless and the fans need to realise.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/cristiano-ronaldo-future-man-utd-ralf-rangnick-b997571.html,Cristiano Ronaldo drops strong hint over Manchester United future amid Ralf Rangnick backing,"ristiano Ronaldo has seemingly hinted that he will be staying at Manchester United this summer. The Portugese superstar’s two-year contract at Old Trafford is not set to expire until June 2023, yet there has been fierce debate over recent months as to whether he should leave for a second time at the end of the season. While Ronaldo has proved United’s saviour on plenty of occasions with 24 goals in 38 appearances across all competitions this term, many have questioned his place in what is expected to be a drastic rebuild of the ailing Red Devils under new permanent manager Erik ten Hag. However, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner appeared to strongly hint that he would be staying put after again enjoying a starring role against Brentford in the Premier League on Monday night. Ronaldo is now only four strikes behind Liverpool leader Mohamed Salah in the Golden Boot race after dispatching a second-half penalty in the morale-boosting 3-0 victory over Brentford. He had earlier seen an initial effort ruled out for offside before the interval. Cristiano Ronaldo enjoyed a starring role again for Manchester United in their 3-0 win over Brentford After emphatically scoring his spot-kick, Ronaldo pointed to himself and then down to the Old Trafford turf, seemingly indicating that he may be staying after all. Then, while soaking up the adulation of the fans during a post-match lap of honour to mark the last home match of a difficult United campaign, he appeared to mouth to the Sky Sports cameras: “I’m not finished.” Interim boss Ralf Rangnick insisted once again after the win over Brentford that any decision on Ronaldo’s future should be deferred to Ten Hag, yet he backed the 37-year-old to remain part of the squad despite his repeated claims that United will need to sign at least two top-class strikers this summer. “The way we played again tonight, not only because he scored he also won the penalty and helped defensively, why should he not be part of the squad and help the team?” said Rangnick. “But this is a question you have to ask Erik and also Cristiano. “Cristiano is not a central striker. He does not want to play in that position but if you look at international football there are not many teams who play with two strikers. “For me, it is a question of what players Manchester United have in the future. It is obvious United need two more quality strikers. Modern strikers do not necessarily have to be strikers. Liverpool or Manchester City have five or six top-class strikers. If you ask me if Gabriel Jesus or Jack Grealish is a winger or a striker, they can all play there. “Mason Greenwood would have been one, then after the West Ham game he was no longer part of the squad. Anthony Martial was on loan and Edinson Cavani injured.” ",positive,manchester united,3

Unlike so many games this season in which Ronaldo’s goals have papered over the cracks, the 37-year-old proved instrumental in the win even aside from both winning and penalty. At times, Ronaldo was even tracking back in order to win the ball before combining with Bruno Fernandes, Juan Mata and Anthony Elanga in a manner United fans have not seen before this season. Granted, the fact Brentford are not playing for much has to be taken into account but United resembled something of a cohesive attacking unit at times, all while dealing with Christian Eriksen’s delicious deliveries well from a defensive point of view. Fernandes opened the scoring following an Elanga cross after the youngster broke behind the Brentford defence in the opening ten minutes before Mata teed up Ronaldo for another goal on the break. That, however, was chalked off by VAR after an offside call and United went into the interval with only a one goal lead. From there, United really stepped up a gear. Led by Ronaldo, both Mata and Nemanja Matic also impressed on what is definitely their final appearances as a United player on home soil. Raphael Varane would sweep home a third as supporters bid farewell a number of players, not many of whom have lived up to their billing. In many ways, it was a strange, somewhat of testimonial-like atmosphere. A game that really did not matter, the handbrake was off and at least some of the negativity was lifted as Mata, Matic and Edisnon Cavani were applauded off the United stage. The Erik Ten Hag era is coming and Ronaldo’s future is uncertain. For the other players labelled as deadwood for much of the past few years, it was at least an amicable goodbye.

The influential Bardsley, who turns 38 in October, will call time on an impressive career spanning two decades at the end of the current Women’s Super League (WSL) campaign. “It was obviously a pretty tough decision for me to make but, after a lot of deliberation and unfortunately being away from the pitch for quite a while now due to injury, it just felt like it was the right moment,” she said on Monday. “As sad and strange as it is to be stepping away from something I’ve committed my entire young adult life to, ultimately it’s something I feel really proud of and I can honestly say, hand on heart, that I’ve left no stone unturned and I have no regrets about how I’ve applied myself and what I’ve achieved. “I feel incredibly proud of my career but ultimately I’m really excited about the next steps and what is to come in the future, and I’m just very much looking forward to giving back to the football community in many other ways.” SPONSORED The American-born Bardsley has 81 senior England caps to her name, featuring in three World Cups and two European Championships. She also played at London 2012 for Great Britain and was part of Hege Riise’s initial squad for last summer’s delayed Tokyo Olympics, though was forced to withdraw through injury. Bardsley, who played college soccer for the Cal State Fullerton Titans, began her club career in the United States, playing for Ajax America Women, Pali Blues and Sky Blue FC before moving to Europe with Swedish outfit Linköpings. She first arrived in English football with Lincoln in 2013, joining Manchester City a year later ahead of their debut season in the WSL. Bardsley won the WSL title with City in 2016, plus four League Cups and three FA Cups. With the Lionesses, the 37-year-old was a member of the squad that finished third at the 2015 World Cup in Canada, also lifting the Cyprus Cup twice and the SheBelieves Cup in the USA in 2019. Manchester United’s Mary Earps has now established herself as England’s first-choice goalkeeper under Sarina Wiegman ahead of this summer’s delayed home Euros, with competition from Bardsley’s City team-mate Ellie Roebuck and Aston Villa’s Hannah Hampton. City plan to honour Bardsley ahead of Wednesday’s clash with Birmingham, with a trip to Reading then in store before the FA Cup Final clash with Chelsea at Wembley on May 15. They currently sit fourth in the WSL, one point adrift of United in third and with a game in hand on their rivals. “Karen has left an undeniable mark on women’s football, and I believe that her playing career is just the start of the overall impact she will make,” said City head coach Gareth Taylor. “Although injury has limited her appearances on the pitch during my time in charge, she has remained an integral member of our team and has made a real difference behind the scenes. “She deserves all the plaudits that she receives, and I would like to wish her the very best for the future and the next step of her journey.” ",positive,manchester united,1
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/man-utd-transfer-news-ronaldo-rangnick-ten-hag-b997476.html,"Manchester United need to sign ‘two or three new strikers’ under Erik ten Hag, says Ralf Rangnick","alf Rangnick believes that Manchester United need to sign up to three new strikers this summer, but would not be drawn on Cristiano Ronaldo’s future at Old Trafford. The Red Devils are set for another comprehensive reset at the end of a dismal campaign, with Erik ten Hag leaving Ajax to take over the managerial reins after being preferred to Paris Saint-Germain boss Mauricio Pochettino. Interim boss Rangnick is also set to remain as planned in a consultancy role, which he is set to combine with duties as the new head coach of the Austrian national team. United will require major surgery in the transfer market once Ten Hag is on board, with a drastic squad overhaul required to address problems all over the pitch and the likes of Paul Pogba, Edinson Cavani, Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata all expected to depart. Ronaldo has been the saviour for United on several occasions since his sensational return to the club last summer, though there remains a debate over the 37-year-old’s future in such a rebuild. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner has another year remaining on his contract, though Rangnick said it is up to Ten Hag to make a decision on Ronaldo as he stressed the need for United to significantly strengthen their forward department for next season regardless. “This is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag,” Rangnick told Sky Sports of Ronaldo ahead of Monday night’s Premier League visit of Brentford. “He’s showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it’s obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, it’s pretty obvious.” Rangnick has still yet to speak to Ten Hag since the Dutchman was last month confirmed as United’s fifth permanent manager since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013. It remains to be seen if Cristiano Ronaldo will be part of the Erik ten Hag era at Manchester United However, he is expecting to sit down with his successor once the respective English and Dutch seasons have concluded, with United now embroiled in a fierce fight just to make the top six and Ajax on track for another Eredivisie title but denied a potential double following defeat by rivals PSV Eindhoven in the Dutch Cup Final. Rangnick said: ""I'm pretty sure he's got my phone number! He's got another couple of games to play with Ajax, we have another three games to play here. Whenever he wants to speak with me and exchange our opinions, I'm more than happy to do that."" ",positive,manchester united,2
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-rob-holding-mikel-arteta-mohamed-elneny-b997441.html,Arsenal: Unlikely heroes emerge as Mikel Arteta’s young side regain control of Champions League battle,"or much of Arsenal’s season their young players have been centre stage, but this recent revival has seen other unlikely protagonists step forward. After losing to Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton, few would have predicted Arsenal would then beat Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham in quick succession. Nor would many have called that the likes of Eddie Nketiah and Mohamed Elneny would be at the heart of those wins. Against West Ham, it was the turn of Rob Holding to emerge as an unlikely hero as he helped Arsenal battle to a 2-1 win. It was not a great performance from the Gunners and even manager Mikel Arteta described it as “ugly”, but they dug deep to grind out the result and no one embodied that gritty effort more than Holding. The centre-back has been on the periphery this season, playing second fiddle to Ben White and Gabriel and essentially taking on the role of defensive super-sub when Arsenal need to see out a game. ‘Smash glass here in case of emergency’, more or less. For this trip to West Ham, however, Holding was given the chance to start due to White being out injured with a tight hamstring. Holding seized his chance, opening the scoring with a header from a corner before throwing his body on the line as Arsenal held on to their slender lead. “The contribution that he (Holding) is having in terms of minutes is not very noticeable, but the contribution he has for the team is huge,” said Arteta. “He needs some praise. “He is someone like Mo [Elneny]. He is the same type of character, same type of person, that is just humble, just wants to give to the team and is happy with the success. When you ask him to play, he is always ready to do it.” It says a lot about the spirit at Arsenal that Holding and Elneny have barely played this season, but have come in and contributed at the most crucial time. Rob Holding and Mohamed Elneny remain crucial for Arsenal despite a lack of regular games Keeping players happy has not always been easy for Arteta but, even if this slimmed down squad has caused him problems, it has also allowed him to create a greater sense of unity. Holding has played his part in that and it is telling that he is a member of the leadership group, despite not being a regular starter. Off the pitch he has a strong influence in the dressing room and is valued by Arteta, acting as one of his trusted lieutenants. Having a strong first XI is naturally crucial to success, but the role of the squad cannot be overlooked and it has caused issues in the past at Arsenal. Holding’s goal and defensive efforts were pivotal in sealing an important win at West Ham The dressing room has not always been the happiest of places, however it is noticeable now how those on the sidelines seem fully on board, even if they only have limited chances to play. “It’s what it’s been like, Ben and Gabi have been great all year and when I’ve had to come on and try and help us secure the three points it’s vital for us, so to play the full 90 and get the three points is even better,” said Holding. Arsenal’s squad clearly needs strengthening and depth added, but, like last summer, making sure the right characters are signed will be key. In Holding, Arteta has someone who emphatically ticks that box. ",positive,manchester united,1

Tomiyasu made his first Premier League start since January following a lenghty calf problem but was replaced by Cedric Soares after pulling up injured in the 78th minute. Saka, meanwhile, was brought off for Emile Smith Rowe for the final few minutes at the London Stadium and looked to be in some discomfort in the closing stages. Ben White missed the game with a tight hamstring, although it is hoped his problem is not serious. Arteta, who has already lost Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey to injury problems during the run-in, provided a positive update on his players after the game. “Ben got injured against Manchester United, he felt a muscular problem and we checked him, and we will have to assess him in the next few days to see how he is,” he said. “Bukayo was fine, he was really fatigued and he has been through a little injury as well. Tomiyasu has just that he had been out for so long and could not continue.” Arsenal are next in action when they host Leeds United on Sunday, a day after top four rivals Tottenham travel to Liverpool. The two north London heavyweights will then meet on Thursday May 12 in what looks like a straight shootout to determine who qualifies for next season’s Champions League.

Pulisic has been limited to only 10 Premier League starts this season with Thomas Tuchel preferring the likes of Timo Werner, Kai Havertz and Mason Mount in attacking areas. With Romelu Lukaku and Hakim Ziyech also in the mix, Tuchel boasts some formidable firepower on paper. Still, his side missed a number of chances during Thursday’s draw against Manchester United and drew a blank away at Everton on Sunday, with Richarlison’s 46th-minute goal proving the difference at Goodison Park. Pulisic, despite scoring a late winning goal against West Ham last week, was only brought for the final twenty minutes of both games. The American international, signed for almost £60m from Borussia Dortmund in 2019, has just over two years left on his contract at Stamford Bridge. “The sad thing is he loves this club, teammates, and London.… puts his heart and soul into being a pro,” wrote father Mark on Twitter. “Onwards and upwards my boy…big 6 months ahead..” ",positive,manchester united,1

Pernille Harder coverted a late penalty to claim a hard-fought three points for Emma Hayes’ side, who sit four points ahead of rivals Arsenal, who have only one game in hand. Earlier on Sunday, Arsenal had romped to a 7-0 win over Aston Villa to ramp up the pressure. Vivianne Miedema scored twice with powerful shots in the opening 13 minutes to send Arsenal in at 2-0 up at the break, and an own goal by Rachel Corsie seven minutes into the second half saw Villa crumble. Beth Mead, Lotte Wubben-Moy and Stina Blackstenius all got on the scoresheet before Parris smacked home a 90th-minute penalty to reach a half-century of league goals in the English top flight as the Gunners climbed to 49 points, one behind Chelsea. Arsenal face Tottenham Hotspur, who play Everton later on Sunday, in midweek before finishing their league campaign away to West Ham, while Chelsea meet Birmingham before taking on Manchester United in their final fixture. Manchester United cruised to a 3-0 win over West Ham United to climb back into third place above Manchester City, who thumped Brighton & Hove Albion 7-2 on Saturday. At the bottom of the table, Leicester grabbed a 0-0 draw with Reading for what may prove to be a vital point in the battle against relegation.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/thomas-tuchel-chelsea-premier-league-top-four-b997416.html,Thomas Tuchel admits Chelsea are ‘never safe’ in top-four race after Everton defeat,"homas Tuchel claims Chelsea are now in a battle to secure top four after just two wins in their last six Premier League games. A 1-0 defeat to Everton continued their shaky end of season form and threatens to drag them back towards to Tottenham and Arsenal in the fight for Champions League places. Tuchel criticised his defence for another costly error that gifted Richarlison the winning goal just after half time. But it was a day when his attack let him down once again – even if it required the brilliance of Jordan Pickford to get Everton over the line. Tuchel said: “I said this many weeks ago that I didn’t feel safe and we are never safe. By the way, if we are in a race for top one, top two or top four, no matter what the race, the last four games to only have four points will never be enough, no matter which race we are in. “We have to take care about ourselves. At the moment we don’t get the points when we play well and deserve more and we lose when we play okay. This is a bad mixture.” Cesar Azpilicueta was caught in possession by Richarlison, who fired the winner at the start of the second half. Tuchel has seen his side dominate possession against Manchester United and Everton in the space of three days, yet his team have only managed one goal and one point from those games. He insists the issue is in defence, not attack. “We knew what was coming and like in the last matches we struggled to have clean sheets,” he said. “In the last four we had one, against West Ham, it is the only win we have and I’m very disappointed. “What can I do? The ball is free, give a goal away, it is the worst thing that can happen to you in this atmosphere. It happens too often. We struggle to play without big mistakes and it is why we struggle to have results.” On his attack he added: “If there is something I can do I will try it, but if I knew about it I would have done it before. “For me the key is to have a clean sheet. Manchester United was a different game. More open, fluid. We finally scored late and conceded straight away. “For me this is more like the game against West Ham and we had a clean sheet and played without any big mistakes and that gives us the chance to score late. “If you install emotion and belief in a stadium like this, you struggle.” Everton fans tried to put Chelsea off by setting off fireworks outside the Liverpool Hilton hotel where they stayed on Saturday night. Tuchel said they did not affect him. “I personally woke up twice at 1am and 3am for one minute and after the noise. I turned around and kept on sleeping.” ",positive,manchester united,2
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-fc-pickford-everton-b997412.html,Magnificent Jordan Pickford display no excuse for Chelsea in latest lacklustre performance,"f not for Jordan Pickford, Chelsea would have won this match. But while the England goalkeeper was in Superman mode, it would be letting Thomas Tuchel’s side off the hook to suggest he was the overriding reason for Everton’s crucial 1-0 win. As inspired as he was, Chelsea were abject. They slept-walked through the first half at Goodison Park, stumbled into the traps Frank Lampard set – and, ultimately, got what they deserved. Absolutely nothing. Cesar Azpilicueta’s error at the start of the second half was seized on by Richarlison and may go a long way towards the Toffees’ Premier League survival. The roar from the home crowd that greeted every challenge won, every heroic moment from Pickford, and the final whistle - underlining just how significant a result this was. As for Chelsea, they felt ill-prepared for the fight they were in for, but – most worryingly for Tuchel – ill-prepared to capitalise on the dominance of the ball Lampard was clearly happy to concede. Chelsea’s manager simply must address this glaring weakness in his team if he is to have any hope of closing the gap to Manchester City and Liverpool next season. In back-to-back games in the North West this week – against Manchester United and Everton – they have bossed possession and chances created and walked away with one goal and one point from a possible six. That is not good enough for any team with realistic ambitions of the title. Which is why his claim that his defence is his biggest concern after these latest dropped points, may not sit too well with supporters. “If there is something I can do, I will try it, but if I knew about it I would have done it before,” Tuchel said. “For me the key is to have a clean sheet. The issue is that we don’t have enough clean sheets.” The ongoing lack of cohesion in his forward line, as well as lack of precision, has cost Chelsea too often this season and their manager cannot turn a blind eye to it. At this point it feels as much to do with personnel as the coaching. This is a problem that has been in place since Tuchel took charge 15 months ago, with the list of strikers who have failed to produce at the point of his attack stretching from Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud to Timo Werner and Romelu Lukaku. With Chelsea desperate for a goal with more than 20 minutes to go, Tuchel left £97.5million record signing Lukaku on the bench. That speaks volumes about the Belgian’s future – but also points to his manager’s failure to get a tune out of him. If a new centre forward is recruited this summer, would there be any confidence that he would thrive where a growing list of others have not? But it is not only the cutting edge. Where is Chelsea’s guile around the box to open up deep-lying defences? They too often rely on the width of Reece James or the injured Ben Chilwell - missing the sort of incisive, intricate football City and Liverpool produce. Mason Mount, deployed as a No10 again, is energetic, but at times his side need craft over graft. These are all areas Tuchel must look at if his side are to find another dimension. It was not until the second half, with Chelsea a goal behind and fortunate not to be two-down that they finally awoke from their slumber. Unfortunately for them, Pickford’s concentration levels were sharp despite his inaction. First the he tipped Mount’s effort from inside the box onto the post, with the ball rolling across to hit the other upright. From the rebound, Azpilicueta fired goalwards, but Pickford was there again to block. Moments later he was flying at the feet of Toni Rudiger to deny the Chelsea from close range – albeit with his face. He would not be beaten. Ruben Loftus-Cheek – one of Chelsea’s few players to try to open Everton up – struck from distance, only for Pickford to get a hand on it again. Even deep into stoppage time, substitute Mateo Kovacic was denied an equaliser when the keeper dived low to claw away from the bottom corner. Pickford celebrated every save like it was a goal – and so did the crowd. Chelsea’s fans, meanwhile, were given nothing to cheer. ",positive,manchester united,1

Sancho remains absent for tonight’s Premier League visit of Brentford to Old Trafford due to tonsilitis, having also sat out Thursday’s 1-1 draw against Chelsea. And Rangnick believes the England winger could stay on the sidelines for all of United’s final three outings this term. “As it seems, Jadon might be out for the rest of the season with his tonsillitis so he will most likely be not available against Brentford,” the German said. “Since the last game is another three weeks to go against Crystal Palace, but for the next two games I think it is unlikely.

The 63-year-old will continue working on a consultancy basis with Manchester United once Erik Ten Hag replaces him as the club’s manager at the end of the season. Ten Hag was confirmed earlier this month. Rangnick arrived in Manchester with a glittering reputation for helping clubs shape a long-term strategy, although the German has failed to improve things at Old Trafford on a short-term basis.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-antonio-conte-top-four-b997102.html,Antonio Conte must use squad to freshen up stale Tottenham after pair of blanks,"ntonio Conte’s view of his Tottenham squad can be summed up by a phrase the head coach has used to explain his reluctance to make substitutions. “I look to the bench, then I look back to the pitch!” Conte has remarked to staff. Conte, in short, is not convinced by his options outside his first XI, and the only changes he has made in 12 matches have been forced by injuries at wing-back. Saturday’s frustrating 0-0 draw with Brentford perfectly demonstrated Conte’s unwillingness to turn to his bench. With Spurs needing a goal to match Arsenal’s earlier win over Manchester United, Conte’s first change was centre-half Davinson Sanchez for Ryan Sessegnon in the 74th minute, while he did not introduce Lucas Moura until four minutes from time. Steven Bergwijn remained unused, which was bizarre in the circumstances, particularly given the Dutchman’s heroics in the last meeting with Sunday’s opponents Leicester, who visit north London on the back of last night’s 1-1 home draw against Roma in the Europa Conference League. Substitute Bergwijn scored twice in stoppage-time as Spurs sensationally won 3-2, despite trailing in the 95th minute, at the King Power Stadium in January. There is a view from some at Spurs that Bergwijn being the match-winner that night may not have been entirely in the club’s best interests. His stunning late show effectively ensured it would be a PR disaster to sell him to Ajax in the final week of January, as Spurs were considering, but he has since played just 175 minutes in the League. Clearly, the club might have been better off selling him and doing a late deal for a wing-back or an attacker Conte really rates. The big issue with Conte’s reluctance to use his full squad is that his first XI quickly ran out of ideas and steam in the matches against Brighton and Brentford and, damningly, Spurs go into Sunday having not had a shot on target for over three hours. Graham Potter’s Seagulls may just have established a blueprint with which to stop Conte’s side — specifically, prevent Harry Kane from getting on the ball and deny the England captain, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski space in the final third. For all their encouraging progress under Conte, Spurs are still not much better at creating chances against canny opponents as they were under Jose Mourinho. Their wins over Leeds, Everton and West Ham came against sides who all adopted a gung-ho approach, while the thrashings of Aston Villa and Newcastle came after they had been outplayed in the first half but managed to establish a lead, before picking off an opponent who had to chase the game. Until he can make those signings, establishing a Plan B would be a start, but Conte is committed to his approach and appears reluctant to experiment. Among his options would be a switch to a back-four, with Bergwijn or Moura coming in at the expense of a defender, but this risks Spurs’ defensive solidity, which has remained intact. A more realistic move would be to bring either of the above into the front three and move Kulusevski to right wing-back, where the injured Matt Doherty is a miss, as Conte did for the final few minutes against Brentford. The risk there is that the connection between the midfield two and front three is further disrupted without link-man Kulusevski drifting between the thirds. Adding an extra midfield body in Harry Winks is another possibility. The good news for Conte is that Spurs’ next three opponents — Leicester, Liverpool and Arsenal — all have coaches who prefer their teams to have possession and play on the front foot, which should suit the Italian’s approach of absorbing pressure and attacking the space. Conte, though, cannot continue to rely on opponents playing into his team’s hands if Spurs are to overhaul Arsenal again in the battle for fourth. ",positive,manchester united,1

The 37-year-old scored his 17th Premier League goal of the season on Thursday to rescue a point against Chelsea and his overall tally stands at 23 in 37 club appearances. United’s problems are surely more systemic than merely Ronaldo, who remains an elite goalscorer, but his signing has been criticised in some quarters as an example of the club being focused on superstar names rather than coherent strategy. The arrival of Erik Ten Hag this summer further muddies the waters. With the Dutchman needing to rebuild, it’s unclear as to whether or not Ronaldo will feature, or even if the Portugal international would wish to given United will likely miss out on Champions League qualification. Under contract until the summer of 2023, Ronaldo has previously hinted he does not want to be challenging for merely a place in the top four. Speaking after United’s draw with Chelsea, Rangnick said: “His attitude, he’s 37 - it’s not normal.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/mino-raiola-football-super-agent-b997320.html,"Loved by players, the bane of top managers - Mino Raiola too powerful for football’s biggest names to ignore","ino Raiola’s influence on the world of football will be further underlined this summer. Two of the super agent’s most famous clients will be involved in arguably the most significant deals of the upcoming window. Erling Haaland is set to complete a move to Manchester City, while Paul Pogba will become a free agent and is set to walk away from Manchester United. By Raiola’s standards they will represent loose change in terms of the fees they generate – but will go down as two of the biggest deals in history. Haaland is available for £63million due to the buyout clause inserted by his representative when he moved to Borussia Dortmund in 2020. That paves the way to personal terms that have been reputed to be as high a £500,000-a-week. Pogba, meanwhile, will be in line for an enormous signing on fee when he walks away from Old Trafford, along with a weekly wage that will make him one of the highest-paid players in the world. No wonder Raiola’s clients are so fiercely loyal to him. The Italian always claimed his priority was to get the best deal for his clients like Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and they loved him for it. Managers and chief executives did not always feel the same. He felt the wrath of Sir Alex Ferguson after engineering Pogba’s exit from United as a free agent when one of the hottest prospects in the game in 2012. Ferguson wrote in his autobiography: “There are one or two football agents I simply do not like, and Mino Raiola is one of them. I distrusted him from the moment I met him. “He and I were like oil and water. From then on, our goose was cooked because Raiola had been able to ingratiate himself with Paul and his family and the player signed with Juventus.” His relationship with Pep Guardiola was even more fraught, with Raiola outspoken in his criticism of the Catalan over his treatment of Ibrahimovic when managing him at Barcelona. “If Guardiola doesn’t play Ibra after paying €75million for him, it’s best if you send him to a psychiatric hospital.” He later claimed to have confronted Guardiola after the Champions League Final in 2011. “I went for him that night in the corridors at Wembley,” he said. “Only Adriano Galliani stopped me. Lucky for Guardiola.” Raiola later said: “Pep Guardiola, the coach, is fantastic. As a person he’s an absolute zero. He’s a coward, a dog.” Given such personal enmity, it emphasises Raiola’s power that he was still prepared to work with him to bring in Haaland this summer. Likewise, United were prepared to do repeated business with him even after Ferguson’s experience. Pogba was brought back to Old Trafford for a then-world record £89million. Raiola was believed to have earned a staggering £41million from that deal. Ibrahimovic, Romelu Lukaku and Henrikh Mkhitaryan were other big money moves to United. And he hardly improved relations with the club or fans with his frequent public comments casting doubt over Pogba’s future. Guardiola famously claimed Raiola even tried to engineer a move for the France midfielder to City. Raiola was simply too big to ignore – too powerful for any club to refuse to do business with. And City’s impending deal for Haaland is the greatest evidence for that. It is also a further example of the brash Italian’s careful management of his clients. Haaland could have joined United back in 2020, when the player’s mentor, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, made such a strong bid to bring him to Old Trafford. Instead, he rejected the possibility of the bigger move to further develop his game at Dortmund. Two and a half years on, Haaland is wanted by all the major clubs and can take his pick. He may just be Raiola’s legacy. ",positive,manchester united,1

In front of a sparse United crowd amid a fan protest against the Glazer ownership, Chelsea quickly settled into a good rhythm. Kai Havertz was guilty of squandering the visitors’ most significant openings in the first half, whipping a shot against the side netting after a breakaway before slapping a one-on-one shot against David De Gea’s shoulder. The goalkeeper was then able to deny a free header, straight at him, as Chelsea produced everything but a finish. Reece James and Mason Mount were enjoying the freedom of Manchester down the right and the midfielder attempted to prise open the deadlock with a whipped cross that beat De Gea, and Timo Werner, shortly after the break. Beforehand, Havertz had again wasted a good counter with a sloppy pass.

But even the most optimistic of home fans would not have expected Cristiano Ronaldo to appear moments later and slam home a leveller, after good work from Nemanja Matic.

The ex-midfielder told Sky Sports ahead of the game with Chelsea on Thursday: “I think he’s a good appointment, there’s been a lot of speculation and the club will be glad to get the deal done - so he can start looking at the club and the background. “He’s got a solid CV, a very good reputation. But I suppose the proof will be in the pudding and we’ll know better when he’s in the job and he gets the backing, the support and hopefully a little bit of power to get United back competing at the top.” United legend Keane warned Ten Hag that he has a big job on in the transfer market, echoing Gary Neville’s sentiment of a potentially “brutal transition”. “He’s got to get a group of players that will give everything for the cause, that will be hard to beat,” he added. “Hopefully he’ll have a style of play that entertains the fans, but it’s a rebuilding job. He’s fortunate coming in in the summer with five or six players on big contracts already leaving - that will help. “I think every United manager will get backing, he will get some money to spend but it’s about getting the right players and right characters into the club - what we’ve seen from this group of players that last few months has not been good enough.” ",positive,manchester united,1

Having watched top four rivals Arsenal beat Manchester United earlier on Saturday, Spurs knew the pressure was on. They looked devoid of all attacking creativity and for the second successive game they failed to have a shot on target. It could have been even worse as Ivan Toney was denied by the woodwork twice as Brentford almost made it four wins in a row. Tottenham’s front three of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski were again blunted and it looks as if Spurs, who had scored a glut of goals in recent weeks, have been found out. Their top-four hopes remain in their own hands, however, as they still have Arsenal to play at home in a game that is looking like being decisive in the race.

Unlike so many games this season in which Ronaldo’s goals have papered over the cracks, the 37-year-old proved instrumental in the win even aside from both winning and penalty. At times, Ronaldo was even tracking back in order to win the ball before combining with Bruno Fernandes, Juan Mata and Anthony Elanga in a manner United fans have not seen before this season.

Tottenham had a busy day, with Juventus duo Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur becoming the first signings of the Antonio Conte era, while Tanguy Ndombele completed his return to Lyon on loan, Giovani Lo Celso went to Villarreal and Dele Alli joined Everton in a dramatic late deal. Arsenal have not added to their ranks, beyond Auston Trusty who will stay at Colorado Rapids, despite reports linking them to moves for Alvaro Morata and Alexander Isak, but did see a further departure. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang joined Barcelona on a free transfer, with an announcement expected on Tuesday morning. Ousmane Dembele was linked with both Chelsea and Manchester United in recent days, with reports suggesting a move to PSG has broken down, but will stay at Barcelona. Meanwhile, Kylian Mbappe is said to have decided to join Real Madrid.

There were no incomings as expected at Crystal Palace, though they have made Jean-Philippe Mateta’s move a permanent one. Donny van de Beek has joined Everton, while West Ham‘s hopes of re-signing Jesse Lingard are over, with Man United not willing to let him leave this month.

In the other major done deals of the day, Manchester City have landed Julian Alvarez, Rangers have signed Aaron Ramsey on loan and Christian Eriksen has joined Brentford for six months. Follow transfer deadline day LIVE with Standard Sport’s blog below! It’s been a long month and there’s been plenty to keep track of in the Premier League. Dele Alli to Everton, Christian Eriksen to Brentford and Philippe Coutinho were some of the most notable moves made. Here’s a full list of every incoming deal made by top-flight clubs in the January window. Just 16 months after signing a lucrative three-year contract and vowing to become an Arsenal legend, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left under a cloud, writes Simon Collings. Aubameyang was exiled by Mikel Arteta after being stripped of the captaincy following a disciplinary breach that ultimately led to a sad end to his time at Emirates Stadium. He has not played a minute since December, was dropped from the squad and Arteta said he failed to demonstrate the “commitment and passion” to play for the club. Clearly, their relationship was broken beyond repair. Read the full story here on the long-term thinking behind Arsenal’s bold decision. It’s the one we’ve been waiting for! Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s free transfer to Barcelona has officially been confirmed by Arsenal. Aubameyang was pictured arriving in Barcelona on Monday lunchtime, when the clubs were in talks over a potential loan move, but as reports emerged that the deal had broken down it was suggested he had only been in the Spanish city to visit family. However, the deal was revived late in the day as a permanent transfer, signalling the end of the forward’s Arsenal career. Read the full story here. Arsenal’s January transfer window was a tale of frustration and, ultimately, the failure to strengthen the squad will ramp up the pressure to spend in the summer, writes Standard Sport’s Simon Collings. Mikel Arteta was bullish throughout last month about the need for Arsenal to “maximise every window” and, while that may have been the case with outgoings, it wasn’t so with incomings. Read the full story. Chelsea have confirmed the signing of Mason Burstow from Charlton, with the teenager heading back to the Valley on loan. Read the full story. Dele Alli paid special tribute to Mauricio Pochettino as he bid farewell to Tottenham after seven years at the club. Everton signed the midfielder on an initial free transfer, which could reach £30million, on transfer deadline day. It ended Dele’s long association with Spurs, and he thanked the club and fans for their support. Notably, former boss Pochettino and his staff were thanked for their “trust and guidance” during the early part of his career in North London. He wrote on social media: “It’s the end of the chapter but not the book. Thank you all for the messages.” Read the full story. Newcastle confirm the loan exit of Jack Young to Wycombe on loan.

Thomas Tuchel was left frustrated by the failure to cover Chelsea’s injury crisis during the January window, writes Standard Sport’s James Robson. But the German – who warned the season could be wrecked if no mid-season additions were made – will be boosted by the return of Reece James, Andreas Christensen and Trevoh Chalobah this month. Tuchel’s main priority was always to bring in longer-term targets if they became available in January. And the focus will be on stamping more of his mark on the squad in the summer, with a host names already identified. Read the full story. Barcelona president Joan Laporta has claimed that Ousmane Dembele has already found his next club after rejecting a move to the Premier League on deadline day. Chelsea were strongly linked with the French winger, who was available for a move after negotiations over a new Barcelona contract collapsed. Instead, he will now leave as a free agent in the summer. “The Dembele thing is difficult to understand,” Laporta told a press conference on Tuesday. “Dembele is in the team and Xavi has to build a competitive squad with players who have a future at this club. “We think that Dembele already has a contract with another club, they have insinuated that to us.

To expect anything in the way of wholesale changes during the arduous January market would be too much, although Conte is a man who does need satisfying. Having constantly spoken about needing to raise the level of the team, surely Spurs will be doing all they can to back him during what remains of this month. At least showing Conte there’s a chance to grow and a readiness to provide him with fresh options is of the utmost importance. If the the Italian does not feel there’s a willingness to rebuild the squad, perhaps the former Chelsea boss’ frustration will grow. With that in mind, here’s a look at the latest on Spurs’ transfer gossip. SPONSORED According to Fabrizio Romano, Spurs and Newcastle United have had loan offers for the forward snubbed. While Martial is believed to be looking for a way out of Old Trafford, it seems his future could lie abroad. Sevilla, Barcelona and Juventus are all said to be keen in what must be a blow for Spurs given Conte has called for a new addition in that department. Dan Kilpatrick has previously reported that Fabio Paratici is actively looking to sell the midfielder. Conte has been rather cutting in his assessment of the Frenchman and, after being booed off against Morecambe in the FA Cup, it’s very hard to see a way back for him. Still, finding a buyer this month is likely to be difficult. Perhaps the major name to have been linked with Spurs this month, Wolves have snubbed a £15m offer for the player and are holding out for £20m, It remains to be seen if Spurs will go that far. Given Pierluigi Gollini has barely covered himself in glory and Hugo Lloris is yet to extend his contract, a new goalkeeper could be needed at Spurs. Earlier this month, the MEN reported that Spurs were keen on a move for Manchester United’s Dean Henderson, although Ralf Rangnick has since stressed he’s looking to keep the England hopeful despite his lack of first-team minutes.

Deadline day reaction: Aubameyang signs; Dele to Everton; shirt numbers; done deals,"ransfer news LIVE! Deadline Day is over with Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United making no significant additions to their squads. Tottenham had a busy day, with Juventus duo Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur becoming the first signings of the Antonio Conte era, while Tanguy Ndombele completed his return to Lyon on loan, Giovani Lo Celso went to Villarreal and Dele Alli joined Everton in a dramatic late deal. Arsenal have not added to their ranks, beyond Auston Trusty who will stay at Colorado Rapids, despite reports linking them to moves for Alvaro Morata and Alexander Isak, but did see a further departure. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang joined Barcelona on a free transfer, with an announcement expected on Tuesday morning. Ousmane Dembele was linked with both Chelsea and Manchester United in recent days, with reports suggesting a move to PSG has broken down, but will stay at Barcelona. Meanwhile, Kylian Mbappe is said to have decided to join Real Madrid. SPONSORED Liverpool have already secured Luis Diaz, and tried to make late swoop for Fulham’s Fabio Carvalho, but could not complete the move in time. There were no incomings as expected at Crystal Palace, though they have made Jean-Philippe Mateta’s move a permanent one. Donny van de Beek has joined Everton, while West Ham‘s hopes of re-signing Jesse Lingard are over, with Man United not willing to let him leave this month.

Follow transfer deadline day LIVE with Standard Sport’s blog below! It’s been a long month and there’s been plenty to keep track of in the Premier League. Dele Alli to Everton, Christian Eriksen to Brentford and Philippe Coutinho were some of the most notable moves made. Here’s a full list of every incoming deal made by top-flight clubs in the January window. Just 16 months after signing a lucrative three-year contract and vowing to become an Arsenal legend, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left under a cloud, writes Simon Collings. Aubameyang was exiled by Mikel Arteta after being stripped of the captaincy following a disciplinary breach that ultimately led to a sad end to his time at Emirates Stadium. He has not played a minute since December, was dropped from the squad and Arteta said he failed to demonstrate the “commitment and passion” to play for the club. Clearly, their relationship was broken beyond repair. Read the full story here on the long-term thinking behind Arsenal’s bold decision. It’s the one we’ve been waiting for! Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s free transfer to Barcelona has officially been confirmed by Arsenal. Aubameyang was pictured arriving in Barcelona on Monday lunchtime, when the clubs were in talks over a potential loan move, but as reports emerged that the deal had broken down it was suggested he had only been in the Spanish city to visit family. However, the deal was revived late in the day as a permanent transfer, signalling the end of the forward’s Arsenal career. Read the full story here. Arsenal’s January transfer window was a tale of frustration and, ultimately, the failure to strengthen the squad will ramp up the pressure to spend in the summer, writes Standard Sport’s Simon Collings. Mikel Arteta was bullish throughout last month about the need for Arsenal to “maximise every window” and, while that may have been the case with outgoings, it wasn’t so with incomings.

Dele Alli paid special tribute to Mauricio Pochettino as he bid farewell to Tottenham after seven years at the club. Everton signed the midfielder on an initial free transfer, which could reach £30million, on transfer deadline day. It ended Dele’s long association with Spurs, and he thanked the club and fans for their support. Notably, former boss Pochettino and his staff were thanked for their “trust and guidance” during the early part of his career in North London. He wrote on social media: “It’s the end of the chapter but not the book. Thank you all for the messages.” Read the full story. Newcastle confirm the loan exit of Jack Young to Wycombe on loan.

Thomas Tuchel was left frustrated by the failure to cover Chelsea’s injury crisis during the January window, writes Standard Sport’s James Robson. But the German – who warned the season could be wrecked if no mid-season additions were made – will be boosted by the return of Reece James, Andreas Christensen and Trevoh Chalobah this month.

The deal would see Dele initially head to Goodison Park on a free transfer, with a £10m fee due to Tottenham after he makes 20 appearances. The fee could eventually rise to £30m depending on performance. The Toffees confirmed Frank Lampard as their new manager on Monday afternoon and within hours of his appointment the former Chelsea boss was hopeful of making Dele his first official signing. Everton have already wrapped up the loan signing of Donny van de Beek from Manchester United, with Lampard's approval. Spurs were expecting to loan out Dele this month but Everton used their final loan spot on Van de Beek and can only pursue a permanent deal. Dele joined Spurs from MK Dons in summer 2015 and established himself as one of the most exciting young players in Europe but he gradually fallen from favour in the last few years, and struggled under all three managers since Mauricio Pochettino was sacked. Newcastle were expected to come in for Dele this month but that never materialised. He has made just seven Premier League appearances for Tottenham this season and Antonio Conte made it clear he was available for transfer in January. In total, Dele has played 269 games for Spurs and scored 67 goals. ",positive,manchester united,1

Manchester City, meanwhile, eased to a 4-0 vwin over Leicester City. Chelsea, who had a one-point lead over second-placed Arsenal coming into the game, went behind early through a Sophie Ingle own goal in the 15th minute before Guro Reiten levelled with a left-footed finish from a tight angle 12 minutes later. The Gunners closed that gap quickly, with Beth Mead and Jordan Nobbs both netting their 50th WSL goals en route to a comfortable win over Everton to move to 46 points with three games left to play. Chelsea keeper Ann-Katrin Berger was sent off before the break for a challenge on Rachel Williams but the champions managed to grab a second goal when Sam Kerr turned in a Jonna Andersson cross in the 71st minute, and Jessie Fleming added a late third.

Neville is a Red Devils legend and made more than 600 appearances for the club in an illustrious career that spanned from 1992 to 2011. He won 20 trophies during his time at the club, which included eight Premier League titles. There is still plenty of affection for the former right-back at Old Trafford and one fan was even sporting a unique scarf in Neville’s honour during their 3-0 win over Brentford on Monday. The Sky Sports cameras panned to the man in question, and Keane and Carragher couldn’t let the opportunity pass. “There must have been a sale on,” former Manchester United captain Keane said. Host David Jones said: “I’m sure they’ll catch on.” Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher added: “Gary Neville or Teabag?”  The Liverpool legend referencing that Neville has an uncanny likeness to the Prison Break character. Keane had some very kind words about Neville later on in Monday Night Football, though, as he picked him in his all-time Manchester United XI. The former midfielder said about the former England right-back: “Brilliant. He was a brilliant player. “He was a brilliant character in a sense, he would go to bed at 8.30pm in the evening and we would criticise him. We all embraced Gary. Gary fell into the group, no problem. “In fairness, when you get into the first team, Gary became more vocal. There’s no stopping him now. Looked after himself.

https://talksport.com/football/1100217/arsenal-transfer-news-lautaro-martinez/,Arsenal to renew interest in Inter Milan star Lautaro Martinez with transfer hinging on Champions League with Man United also keen,"Arsenal have renewed their interest in signing Inter striker Lautaro Martinez. According to The Times, the Gunners are hoping their improved chances of playing in next season’s Champions League could help them in luring the 24-year-old to the Premier League. Martinez has been hugely impressive for the Italian giants this term having scored 21 goals for Simone Inzaghi’s side, which has kept a number of European rivals on alert. This includes Manchester United who could reportedly offer Anthony Martial in exchange. And while Martinez is among the top targets for Mikel Arteta’s side, he’s not the only player whom the Spaniard is after. Gabriel Jesus of Manchester City and Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin are also said to be on the club’s radar as they prepare to revamp their forward line this summer. Arsenal’s hopes of signing Martinez could hinge on their ability to finish the season in the top four. The Gunners are sitting in fourth in the Premier League at present, two points clear of rivals Tottenham, however, with a north London derby just around the corner, talkSPORT host and former Tottenham midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes it’s Spurs who will pip Arsenal to the final Champions League spot.  He told thetalkSPORT Breakfast: “We’ve got to get through Liverpool which is a tough fixture and I’ll be surprised if we get anything from that, but both Arsenal and Tottenham are where they are because they have inconsistent performances. “If we’re talking about winning all of our games between now and the end of the season, we’d be like Chelsea and Liverpool. “We’ll slip up and Arsenal will slip up. We’ve got the north London derby which will be the biggest north London derby in recent times and that is a huge, huge fixture. “I just fancy us, under the lights with the players that we’ve got and the front three that we’ve got. If we step up I think we can turn them over, I really do. “This is a young Arsenal side and credit to them, no one expected them to be where they are and it was a big performance against West Ham and they’re a good young team. “But I think that Spurs have just got a little bit more experience than them and when the pressure’s on, we might just find a way to get it done.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

https://talksport.com/football/1100102/cristiano-ronaldo-man-utd-jamie-carragher-liverpool-erling-haaland-transfers/,"‘Small club’ – Jamie Carragher slams Manchester United’s decision to re-sign Cristiano Ronaldo, saying Erik ten Hag should look to sign Erling Haaland this summer","Manchester United’s move to re-sign Cristiano Ronaldo last summer made Jamie Carragher think they were ‘a small club’, the Liverpool legend has revealed. The Red Devils have endured a difficult season by their own high standards, but the 37-year-old has been a rare shining light with his tally of 18 Premier League goals this term matching his final season at Old Trafford before leaving for £80miilion in 2009. Speculation is building about Ronaldo’s future at the club with a return to Real Madrid suggested as a potential solution, however that will depend on Erik ten Hag’s plans when he arrives this summer. With a big rebuild tipped, talk has started about how United can close the gap on the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City who are running away at the top of the tabl. And, according to Carragher, it’s time that United started focusing on long-term solutions if they’re to restore their status as one of Europe’s top teams. Speaking to Sky Sports, Carragher said: “I see Manchester United as one of the super clubs of world football, and I just look at the others ones like Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Juventus, Barcelona; the ones who have won Champions Leagues. “Even Liverpool right now. Would Liverpool go and bring back Luis Suarez? I don’t think they would, even if they knew he was going to get 20 goals. “Manchester United, for me, should be signing [Erling] Haaland this summer. Man City are getting Haaland, while United have got Ronaldo.   “He is a legend and one of the best goalscorers of all time, and I get that – but it almost made me think that United are a small club. “It reminded me of Wayne Rooney going back to Everton. They knew they weren’t going to win something when Rooney came back but it gives everyone a lift, Wayne’s happy to go back.” Former Man United captain Roy Keane chimed in, saying: “It felt like a short-term fix. [ “[It was] for the fans, the share price and all that, but yeah, he’s still scored the goals that you thought he would do. “As you’ve said, Jamie, I think Man United have got bigger problems than Ronaldo, but it’s something that has to be looked at.”  Signing a new-look attack will be the main priority for United this summer but, according to Ralf Rangnick, that may not come in the form of a traditional number nine. The interim head coach explained: “For me, it is obvious Manchester United needs two more quality strikers that just give this team more options, more quality and more weapons.” Asked for specifics, Rangnick added: “Strikers. Modern strikers do not necessarily have to be wingers. If you look to Liverpool or Manchester City and look at their strikers, they have five or six top-class strikers. “Gabriel Jesus, until four or five weeks ago, he hardly played. Now he is playing again regularly and if you look at the number of players they have and ask me if Gabriel Jesus is a central striker or a winger, is Grealish a central striker or a winger?  “They are all strikers who can play in different positions, they can also switch and they can rotate. “That kind of players, we don’t have that many. Mason Greenwood would have been one of those players who regularly played but then after the West Ham game he was no longer part of the squad. “Martial was on loan at Sevilla, Edinson Cavani was injured most of the time, so we didn’t have that many alternatives up front.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

We are now into May, which means the business end of the year is fast approaching and the race for the Champions League spots is at fever pitch. With Manchester City and Liverpool well clear at the top, there are five more teams in contention for the final two Champions League places plus the Europa League spots, with some massive ties ahead. Most of the sides involved only have four games left, but Manchester United only have two. Here talkSPORT takes a look at the Premier League top-four battle as we approach the end of the campaign…   Chelsea have been in the top four the whole season, and are five points clear of fifth. However, their place in the top four isn’t secure yet and they are going to need a few more results from their last four league games. Thomas Tuchel’s side started the campaign as genuine title contenders, but four wins in 11 saw them drop well behind City and Liverpool. From there, it looked as if the Blues would comfortably seal third, but after defeats to Brentford, Arsenal and Everton, that doesn’t look to be guaranteed yet. Chelsea have had to deal with carnage away from the pitch this season, which would likely mean the Blues will have to cap their spending this summer. So, if they were to miss out on the Champions League, who knows what could happen to the club without that income? In their remaining games, Chelsea face Wolves and Leeds. If they manage to avoid defeat in these fixtures, they should do enough to secure their place in the top four. But a season that had so much promise looks like it will end in slight disappointment. Predicted finish – 3rd Wolves – H – May 8 Leeds – A – May 11 Leicester – H – May 19 Watford – H – May 22  Arsenal have turned it around after a nightmare start that saw them at the bottom of the table after three defeats. Since then, the Gunners have pushed on and they are right in the race for the top four. The North Londoners haven’t played in the Champions League since the 2016/17 campaign, and Mikel Arteta has put his faith in a lot of young and very talented footballers. This group of players have been brilliant for the Gunners, but they lost three games in a row recently against Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton. However, just when things could have turned sour, they managed to beat Chelsea, Man United and West Ham to move two points clear of Spurs. The Gunners still have some massive games to play against the likes of Tottenham and Everton, so Arsenal could yet miss out on a place in the top four. Predicted finish – 5th Leeds United – H – May 8 Tottenham – A – May 12 Newcastle – A – May 15 Everton – H – May 22  Tottenham have had a very odd season but they are still in the race for the Champions League. Spurs started the campaign with Nuno Espirito Santo in charge, but after winning his first three league games, things quickly went wrong and he was dismissed well before Christmas. Antonio Conte arrived as his replacement, and after a solid start in which Tottenham were unbeaten in the league for nine matches, they lost four of their next five, including a 1-0 defeat to Burnley. Things didn’t look great, but on transfer deadline day, Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur arrived from Juventus and have helped turn the season around. Spurs then scored 25 goals in seven league matches, winning six of those. However, they then lost to Brighton and only managed a 0-0 draw against Brentford, which halted their season. But they got back to winning ways on Sunday with a 3-1 victory over Leicester City, so they are back on track. If we look at their remaining fixtures, we can see they still have to play Liverpool and Arsenal. The North London derby against the Gunners could decide who lands that final Champions League spot, but Spurs should still have enough to finish fourth if they turn it on again. Predicted finish – 4th Liverpool – A – May 7 Arsenal – H – May 12 Burnley – H – May 15 Norwich – A – May 22  Man United have had a season to forget – they are out of all the cup competitions and look unlikely to get a place in the top four. The season started with so much optimism after the signings of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho. However, things quickly went wrong, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was dismissed early into the campaign. The Red Devils then brought Ralf Rangnick in until the end of the year as interim manager, but he has never performed that role before and has struggled to get a tune out of this squad. The German has only lost five of his 22 league games in charge but seven draws in that time have cost the Red Devils valuable points, and it looks increasingly likely they won’t finish in the top four. Man United still have to play Crystal Palace and a resurgent Brighton in their last two, but Arsenal and Tottenham have two games in hand on the Red Devils. Therefore, this campaign has the potential to end terribly for the world’s most famous club. Predicted finish – 7th Brighton – A – May 7 Crystal Palace – A – May 22  West Ham have not been outside of the top ten this season and have been as high as third on some occasions. It’s been highly impressive given that David Moyes has a small squad to work with and has one first-team striker in Michail Antonio. The Hammers are also deep into the Europa League, so the fact they have kept up with the likes of Arsenal and Tottenham is commendable, and they should finish in a Europa League spot no matter what. This season has seen the Irons beat the likes of Liverpool and Chelsea but the top four might just be out of their reach. However, given they are in the semi-finals of the Europa League, you would have to make them one of the favourites for that competition, so they could end up in the Champions League anyway. West Ham still have to play Manchester City, so they could still have a big impact on the title race.

Lingard has been at the Red Devils for more than 20 years after first joining as a seven-year-old.  His time at United is set to end this summer when his contract expires, with the midfielder frustrated at the lack of first-team opportunities. The 29-year-old was left on the bench in United’s final home game of the season, which they won 3-0 against Brentford. Other players who are also leaving this summer, like Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic, were given the given the opportunity of a send off – with both named in the starting XI This prompted a furious reaction from Lingard’s brother, Louie Scott, on Instagram – which has since been deleted. “Twenty years of blood sweat and tears, four domestic trophies, three cup final goals, not even a farewell,” his post read. “No wonder it’s [Europa] Conference League next year. “Attacking players for celebrations when the club’s being sold to the super league, OK. “Class of 92, Busby Babes, you’re ran by people who don’t even know the offside trap. “Classless and the fans need to realise. Goodnight, God bless! “Been there since nine years of age and didn’t even get a send off!!! Well done bro your family are proud.” Not everyone shares that sentiment, though, as former West Ham striker Carlton Cole believes Lingard was not enough of a club legend to deserve such a huge send off. He told the talkSPORT Breakfast: “He’s a good player, Jesse Lingard, but Man United have had lots of top players in the past and did they get a send off?  “Is it different for academy boys? No. You are playing for Man United, they are one of the biggest clubs in the world. “They don’t need to pander to anyone. Unless you’ve served the club and been the main man. “If he was a Roy Keane or a Rooney, then I could understand. They’ve gone on to do big things with the club and broken records.

So when the time came to pick his ultimate Red Devils Premier League XI, he was always going to be spoilt for choice.  Sky Sports asked the United legend to pick his team on Monday Night Football after watching his former club beat Brentford 3-0. Keane admitted he was reluctant to do so because of the risk of upsetting people, but did what he was told, and there was inevitably going to be some huge names left out. “I’ve told you before, I don’t like doing this,” Keane said. “I don’t like upsetting some of my teammates. It’s not easy. “I had to leave out some brilliant characters and brilliant players.” The most notable omissions were the likes of Paul Scholes, Rio Ferdinand and Eric Cantona, while also picked some he didn’t exactly get on with.  Keane and Schmeichel famously did not get on, with the pair once having a scuffle in a hotel before a big match, but he was still the pick over Edwin van de Sar and David de Gea in between the sticks. “He was very good… not as good as everyone thought,” Keane said. “He was a good character in the dressing room. The most important thing I had for him was huge respect. He produced big moments and got us through big matches. Peter would produce and help us get trophies. “Being good characters, making important saves. Because we were a decent team, Peter wasn’t called upon much, but he made some big saves for us. He was lively and he produced in the important moments. “Who won the fight? We say it was a draw.”  Neville dominated the right-back position for so many years at Old Trafford, so this decision – with respect to the likes of Wes Brown, Raphael and Paul Parker – was perhaps one of Keane’s easiest. The former midfielder said about Neville: “Brilliant. He was a brilliant player. He was a brilliant character in a sense, he would go to bed at 8.30pm in the evening and we would criticise him. We all embraced Gary. Gary fell into the group, no problem. “In fairness, when you get into the first team, Gary became more vocal. There’s no stopping him now. Looked after himself. You have to have quality to do what he did.”  Republic of Ireland international Irwin and Keane were good friends so there’s no surprise he made it to left-back, and was a pretty decent player to go with it. Kean said: “I roomed with Dennis at United and Ireland. Brilliant trainer, very rarely injured, turned up to the big matches. If he was playing now, Dennis would be up there with the best. He was a good fella.”  Now is where some of the controversial picks start. United had some fantastic centre-backs from Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Steve Bruce, but Keane explained why he had to go for Stam and Pallister. “I couldn’t leave Jaap Stam out. Big strong, brave, brilliant in the one vs ones. I’ve also gone with Garry Pallister. Rio was a good athlete and read the game well, but my relationship with Pally was good. When I first went to United, there were certain lads who went out their way to help and [Lee] Sharpey and Pally were always on the scene. “I was not surprised [when Stam left]. Jaap had a bad injury. But when you’re at a big club, players do come and go quickly. It was a case of moving on.”  United had some brilliant midfielders during the Premier League era and perhaps none more memorable than Beckham. Keane said: “He was younger. He was from London, he loved his gear and his cars. They all have hobbies, but the key for me was are they training properly and giving everything for the cause? Becks did that. “I don’t think I once fell out with him over anything because he turned up every day and put a shift in.”  Giggs is perhaps the greatest Manchester United player of the Premier League era with an incredible 963 appearances in all competitions and a remarkable 13 league titles. “Where do you want to start? He could assist. Everything you want from a wide player. The amount of goals they got from each others’ crosses. “I never felt, even with Giggsy, they were distracted by the off-the-field stuff. Giggs was a superstar in a sense but he was a good teammate to have.”  There were plenty of names Keane could have named in here and one of the most surprising is perhaps leaving out Scholes in favour of Ince. Keane said: “Robson has to go in there. He was a great player for Man United. Scored some big goals for the club. I’m going to put Paul Ince. Another very good player. Tarnished his reputation a bit, he ended up playing forLiverpool. He was a really good teammate. “Tough leaving Scholes out. But I thought Incey was brilliant in midfield. Good teammate to have next to you. He could head it and score goals. I enjoyed his company.”  From Eric Cantona to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Andy Cole and Ruud van Nistelrooy, Keane probably could have picked several strikers in his best XI, but the two he went for were Rooney and Ronaldo. “Yorkie was brilliant, Cantona was brilliant, Ruud, Mark Hughes, Ole. Oh my goodness. Ronaldo and Wayne have to go for what they achieved in the game. All the other brilliant lads I’ve played with, I couldn’t leave any of them two out. “It was easy. You see these young lads coming through, as long as they’re giving their all, that’s part of learning. “These lads, Wayne and Ronaldo, I always felt their priority was football at Man United. If they make a mistake, you try and help them. “Sometimes players have to learn from their mistakes, we certainly wouldn’t be coming down hard.”   When asked if he was happy with his choices, Keane said: “Yeah I’m okay with that. Put it this way, you’ve got a chance [of winning the Premier League]. That’s all you want. “You’ve got players turning up, you’ve got goals in the team, you’ve got characters, you’ve got height, physicality, pace. When asked who would be the manager, Keane joked: “Big Ron Atkinson.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY. FIRST SINGLE & E/W BET ONLY.

https://talksport.com/football/1100088/cristiano-ronaldo-age-stats-manchester-united-premier-league/,Cristiano Ronaldo proves that age is but a number as key Manchester United stat emerges following goal against Brentford in Premier League win,"Manchester United have lacked much in the way of success this term, but Cristiano Ronaldo might just be the exception. In a largely disappointing season, the 37-year-old has been one of the few bright spots after completing a move from Juventus last summer and proving to the football world he very much still has it. Given Ronaldo’s age, plenty of pundits suggested the Portugal star might struggle to thrive in the elite environment of the Premier League, but if there’s one thing CR7 enjoys it’s the pressure of proving people wrong. After scoring twice on his second United debut in the 4-1 victory over Newcastle, supporters knew their former hero had not lost any of his sparkle and that’s become abundantly clear in the months since. In fact, there’s even a suggestion that he’s got better since he was last at the club. Ronaldo’s last season at Old Trafford was in the 2008/09 campaign in which the forward racked up 18 goals in 33 Premier League appearances. This term, he’s exceeded that with time to spare. In 29 league appearances, three of which have come from the bench, Ronaldo has already scored 18 times.  With three top flight fixtures remaining, it would take a brave person to bet against Ronaldo exceeding that tally. Of course there’s ongoing speculation about whether the experienced forward will remain at United next term, but regardless of what the future holds, it’s clear that Ronaldo’s Old Trafford legacy is well and truly intact after his hugely successful swansong. With his immediate future in doubt, Piers Morgan made a rather bold call during his appearance on talkSPORT as he called for the player to leave United and move to his beloved Arsenal instead. Speaking ontalkSPORT Breakfast, Morgan said: “When it comes down to money and owners and riches and banking, we’ve got the richest of all of them.  “Stan Kroenkehas got £10billion, he’s married to a woman who has got even more in the Walmart heiress who has £15billion. He’s just bought a ranch for £750million, he can afford to buy a couple of strikers! “Do you know what I’d do if I was Arsenal manager? I’d go in, get Cristiano Ronaldo and put him up front. I’ve had this conversation with him last week. I said ‘come to Arsenal’. “The Arsenal and Manchester United thing is very interesting. On paper, United have far more talented players and far more experienced, talented players but they don’t have the right attitude. “The mental attitude is shocking. Whatever is going on in that club…if they didn’t have Ronaldo in the team they wouldn’t be winning, whereas Arsenal have young, hungry, really promising guys who have a great attitude. People like [Bukayo] Saka, [Emile] Smith Rowe, [Kieran] Tierney and all of these guys.  “That’s what’s encouraging. If you combined the United talent with our mentality then both clubs would be sorted. “I’m not even joking. I’d love to bring Cristiano Ronaldo to Arsenal. If he’s not going to stay at United, I’d take him in a heartbeat. “I watched that game at the weekend and he was the best player on the pitch. “As a striker, when you watch Ronaldo’s movement and his goalscoring record at 37, I’d put Ronaldo at the front and let these kids learn from him.” However, for now it appears he is staying put judging by his most recent celebration at Old Trafford.

https://talksport.com/football/1100030/erik-ten-hag-cristiano-ronaldo-man-utd-transfer-news/,"Erik ten Hag told to ‘find a way’ to get ‘phenomenal’ Cristiano Ronaldo in Manchester United team, and Ralf Rangnick wants quality strikers","talkSPORT host Jason Cundy believes incoming Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag must prioritise getting Cristiano Ronaldo into his team. The Ajax manager will take the reins at Old Trafford in the summer, and after underwhelming Premier League season, with the new man expected to oversee a squad overhaul. Ten Hag’s favoured style of play centres around dominating possession and pressing from the front which doesn’t necessarily suit 37-year-old Ronaldo, who’s Man United’s top scorer this season. But despite this, Cundy believes that whilst United do need to bolster their attacking options, Ten Hag must still build his team around Ronaldo given his impressive displays, which has seen him notch up 24 goals so far this season. “If Ten Hag is going to play the way he has done at Ajax, you would’ve thought that Ronaldo cannot play every single game,” the former Chelsea player said on The Sports Bar following Man United’s 3-0 win over Brentford. “But then you find a way. His goals have been phenomenal again. His goals to game ratio is phenomenal, greatest goal scorer ever. “So you find a way to have Ronaldo in and around the squad. Whether he’s going to start 38 Premier League games I very much doubt, I can’t see that happening. “United do need help up top, they do.”  United legend Gary Neville echoed Cundy’s thoughts, saying on commentary for Sky Sports: “This is the best they have played this season. “They have looked more connected as a team. “My man of the match is Cristiano Ronaldo. The penalty, the build-up to it, and he had one disallowed in the first half. “Just his all-round performance has been outstanding.” The Portuguese’s future at the club has been questioned over the last few months after his side have suffered yet another disappointing season, with hopes of silverware fading after their defeat to Atletico Madrid in the last-16 of the Champions League in March. However, despite this, Red Devils hero Roy Keane doesn’t believe his former teammate Ronaldo is heading for the exit, agreeing that Ten Hag needs to keep him at Old Trafford.  “I don’t think his body language was suggesting that he was leaving,” Keane explained. “I just look at the goals he’s got, his performances warrant him staying at the club.” Keane continued: “But Man United need to get other strikers in there, there has to be competition for places. If your leading goal scorer, who you’re depending on is 37 years of age, then that’s certainly not good. “But I’d certainly be hanging on to Ronaldo. You might have to have a conversation about the way you’re going to play, or that he won’t be playing week, in week out. But why would you get rid of a player that scores that many goals?” And the need for additional firepower is something current boss Ralf Rangnick is well aware of.  “For me, it is obvious Manchester United needs two more quality strikers that just give this team more options, more quality and more weapons,” he said. Asked what he meant, he explained: “Strikers. Modern strikers do not necessarily have to be wingers. If you look to Liverpool or Manchester City and look at their strikers, they have five or six top-class strikers. “Gabriel Jesus, until four or five weeks ago, he hardly played. Now he is playing again regularly and if you look at the number of players they have and ask me if Gabriel Jesus is a central striker or a winger, is Grealish a central striker or a winger, they are all strikers who can play in different positions, they can also switch and they can rotate. “That kind of players, we don’t have that many. Mason Greenwood would have been one of those players who regularly played but then after the West Ham game he was no longer part of the squad. “Martial was on loan at Sevilla, Edinson Cavani was injured most of the time so we didn’t have that many alternatives up front.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

https://talksport.com/football/1099374/cristiano-ronaldo-stats-man-utd-goals-transfer-news-roy-keane/,Roy Keane tips Cristiano Ronaldo to stay at Manchester United this summer and striker appeared to tell fans he was not finished yet in goal celebration,"Roy Keane has tipped Cristiano Ronaldo to stay at Manchester United this summer and the forward appeared to suggest he was going nowhere on Monday night. The 37-year-old signed a two-year deal on his return to Old Trafford last summer, however, the club’s disappointing Premier League season has led to speculation he could bring his stay to an end early. The Portuguese was recently linked with a move back to Real Madrid, who he played for between 2009 and 2018. Meanwhile, the imminent arrival of Erik ten Hag as manager has led to questions over whether there would be any room in his team for Ronaldo. But club legend Keane is in no doubt that Ronaldo will be part of things next season. Asked if Man United’s clash against Brentford – their final home match of the season – could be Ronaldo’s Red Devils swansong, Keane said: “I wouldn’t have thought so. “I know there’s speculation but I can’t imagine Ronaldo not being at Man United next year unless something drastic changes in the summer. “If you look at the goals he’s got, he’s a threat and any manager would want to work with him. Simple as that.”  Although it’s been a campaign to forget for the 13-time Premier League winners, Ronaldo can hold his head high. So far he has 24 goals to his name, 18 of them in the league. His latest came in their 3-0 win against the Bees as he slotted home a penalty in the second half. And during that celebration he appeared to hint he was staying on beyond the summer by pointing to himself and then Old Trafford as he took in the crowd’s cheers.

https://talksport.com/football/1099983/cristiano-ronaldo-bruno-fernandes-varane-brentford/,"Cristiano Ronaldo scores penalty, while Bruno Fernandes and Raphael Varane end droughts as Red Devils get back to winning ways with triumph over Brentford","Manchester United got back to winning ways as they beat Brentford 3-0 in their final game at Old Trafford this season. The Red Devils secured three points in the league for the first time since their win over bottom side Norwich thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane. United opened the scoring just nine minutes into the clash as an unmarked Fernandes volleyed home Anthony Elanga’s cut-back. The strike was Fernandes’ first goal in his last 11 outings. Shortly after the Portugal international’s goal, the Bees had two attempts at equalising – Christian Eriksen and Ivan Toney both having attempts at goal. Brentford were relieved to see Ronaldo’s strike just before half time ruled out by VAR for offside. However, the Bees were soon left with a bigger mountain to climb after the restart. The Red Devils were awarded a penalty after Rico Henry attempted to win the ball back in the box and collided with Ronaldo having been barged off it by the Portuguese seconds earlier. Sure enough, United’s talisman grasped the opportunity after Chris Kavanagh pointed to the spot, making no mistake as he sent a thumping effort past David Raya from the spot. United’s final goal of the evening came from an unlikely source as Raphael Varane netted his first goal when he latched onto Alex Telles’ inswinging corner from the right.    Prior to the game, United fans had organised another another protest against the Glazer family ownership, which was due to result in a mass walkout in the 73rd minute of the match. However, whilst there were banners displaying their discontent towards those running the club, there wasn’t a noticeable walkout from those who attended. Juan Mata received a standing ovation as he made his way for Phil Jones, as the Spaniard made what will likely be his final appearance at Old Trafford, with him expected to leave in the summer. Roy Keane was asked if Man United’s clash against Brentford could have also been Ronaldo’s Red Devils swansong. However, the United legend wasn’t convinced. “We want Glazers Out”#MUFC fans protest the Glazers on the 72nd minute during #MUNBRE pic.twitter.com/kOYxvHNl7r Roy Keane was asked if Man United’s clash against Brentford could have also been Ronaldo’s Red Devils swansong.

The 23-year-old has been incredible for the Hammers in midfield as they continue to perform well in the Premier League, while also reaching the semi-finals of the Europa League. This, coupled with his standout displays when playing for England, have made him one of the most highly-rated young talents in the game. Chelsea and Manchester United have both been linked with moves for the player who West Ham would want around £150million for. It has been reported that Rice has turned down three contract offers from the club with his future looking set to be away for east London. “I feel like playing well comes with speculation,” Rice told Sky Sports. “I’ve had two or three top seasons with West Ham and the top clubs around the country are always going to be watching. It’s not just me, it’s the same for every player. “I think it’s important not to get too carried away with that. We’ve had a good season with West Ham and there have been big games I’ve had to play in so I feel like my focus has always been on that. If I thought about other things, I’d get carried away and that wouldn’t be fair on the team or the manager. “I can’t help speculation, even with the numbers that get talked about. I get battered for it all the time on social media, but I can’t help that. I can help by going on the pitch and performing as best as I can. “They [West Ham teammates] wind me up all the time. It’s crazy to speak about to be honest, so I just kind of block it out and do what I do best and that’s play football.”   “They [West Ham teammates] wind me up all the time. It’s crazy to speak about to be honest, so I just kind of block it out and do what I do best and that’s play football.” Rice came third in the prestigious Football Writers’ Association Men’s Player of the Year award, behind only Mohamed Salah and Kevin De Bruyne, when the results were announced on Friday. It gives an indication of just how good Rice has been this term and the midfielder thinks he can only get better. “It’s not bad,” Rice said on finishing third in the FWA awards. “I would like to have won it, but obviously up against Salah and De Bruyne it’s hard to say, because I can never imagine putting my name with those types of players. “To come third, it shows that people have appreciated what I’ve done on the football pitch. This season, I feel like I’ve taken another step in the right direction in my career, but I’m still only 23 and trust me, I know myself and I’ve got so much more that I can let out of the bag. “I know that, my coaches tell me that and I think it just comes with time and as I get older, it’ll keep coming and coming.

https://talksport.com/football/1099744/man-utd-fan-protest-glazer-family-brentford-simon-jordan/,Manchester United fans plotting protest against Glazers accused of ‘getting ahead of themselves’ as Simon Jordan says they wouldn’t be as angry if team was winning,"Simon Jordan believes that Manchester United fans are overestimating their influence ahead of yet another protest against the Glazer ownership. It’s understood fans are preparing a march before the Monday night clash with Brentford. It’s understood supporters are being urged to walk out of Old Trafford on 73 minutes, 17 minutes from the end, to signify the 17 years in which the club has been under the current ownership. While admitting that United fans are more than entitled to make their feelings known in a peaceful manner, Jordan believes that there’s only so much that supporters can do when dealing with vast sums of money within the game. He told White and Jordan: “I do think that some fans are getting ahead of themselves and getting carried away with what they’re entitled to do, how to represent their discontent, how influential they are in the world of football and how the European Super League was stopped by fans. “There’s a balance between expressing dissatisfaction, and then engineering disruption and your reach exceeding your grasp. “Man United fans are fully entitled to express their feelings. It’s not my right to tell them how to feel about their ownership model, they’ve every right to be as unhappy as they want to be, but if you’re going to realistically oust the Glazers, you need a proper solution. “But if you’re just going to bark at the moon because you don’t like something… everyone knows they’re unhappy about it. “Do you think this dissatisfaction would be anywhere near as acute if they were winning on the pitch?”   “I acknowledge their point, but if the club were doing well on the pitch, it would be nowhere near the level it is now.” Jordan added: “The Glazers need that team to win too. They’re not stupid. They know that when they’re not in the Champions League their share price is deflated. “Of course their hearts are not with United, they’re American. Do you think Roman Abramovich cared that much about Chelsea? He cared because it was a reflection of him and he wanted to win and he wanted to buy Chelsea to legitimise his position in the world. “What you’re looking for is the perfect circle where someone buys your football club, gives you exactly what you want and when you want it. Even then there will be a segment of Man United fans who won’t be happy if the team doesn’t win.”  But stepping outside of the situation at Old Trafford, Jordan believes that fans must start understanding that football is ‘a money business’. He said: “Man City wasn’t bought because Sheikh Mansour cared about Manchester, he wanted to legitimise a particular regime. “Newcastle hasn’t been bought because the Saudis are wonderful people, they’re being bought for the exact same purpose. “This notion that football clubs aren’t commercial animals, people have to grow up and accept that. “We’ve got to live in the real world where footballers are getting £200k a week, big businesses are broadcasting it around the world, it is now a money business.”  Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

https://talksport.com/football/1099694/man-utd-transfer-ward-prowse-beckham-free-kick-record-world-cup-2022/,"‘Phenomenal’ James Ward-Prowse is a Manchester United transfer target, has David Beckham free-kick record in his sights, and wants World Cup 2022 role","Manchester United transfer target James Ward-Prowse has been tipped to leave Southampton this summer by former teammate Charlie Austin. The England international is enjoying his most prolific season of his career, netting 10 goals in all competitions, and a £75million deal has now been mooted ahead of the Old Trafford overhaul. His set-piece taking has always been lavished with praise and this season a raft of fantastic free-kicks see him now hot on the heels of David Beckham’s Premier League record. The England icon netted 18 in the English top flight and Ward-Prowse now has 14 to his name. But as a potential battle with Man City for his signature beckons, the clubs challenging for the midfielder have been told that the ‘underrated’ schemer would not only be valuable because of his deadball abilities. Austin, who played with Ward-Prowse 46 times over a four-season spell, reckon his all-round game make him a ‘phenomenal’ acquistion, despite the midfielder taking his time to reach his peak. Asked why he had taken so long to reach this level, he told Drive Time last week: “I don’t know. When I was there with him he played second fiddle to [Victor] Wanyama, to Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Jordy Clasie, Oriol Romeu and Steven Davis. “Maybe he just took his time and then over the last two years he’s cemented himself as club captain but certainly know I think it’s time to leave.”  So why would Ward-Prowse want to leave having reached new heights at St Mary’s? Austin thinks he may well have ambitions for later in the year. He said: “I think, if he wants to go to the World Cup, he needs to be at a different football club [compared] to what Southampton are offering and how they are performing. “I think he’s more appealing if he’s at a different club.” Pressed again on why he didn’t move earlier in his career, Austin added: “He’s come throught the academy there and has been there for so many years. I just think that it hasn’t been the right opportunity. “I think now is the time for him to move. “His set-pieces and that are brilliant. He’s probably going to beat David Beckham’s record but, the nuts and bolts of his game, running hard, winning the ball back, and leading his team are phenomenal.”  And former Newcastle and Crystal Palace star Darren Ambrose also believes that Ward-Prowse is capable of playing for a side outside of the top three – which is definitely the case right now for United. He toldtalkSPORT:“I’ve been a massive advocate of James Ward-Prowse, and I think he gets into any team. “If you look at the Premier League table with Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea as the top three, anybody below that he would get in the team as a starter and not make them worse, absolutely.  “The argument of what happens if you take the free-kicks out of it, you can’t because that’s a massive part of the game. “Not many clubs have a set-piece taker like him so you can’t argue about what happens if you take that element out of his game.” He added: “When you’ve got a player like James Ward-Prowse, there’s no one better as a deliverer of balls into the box and when you get a free-kick around the box, you think it’s a goal. I think he’s massively underrated.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY. FIRST SINGLE & E/W BET ONLY. ODDS OF 1/1 OR GREATER. 3 x £10 BET TOKENS.

https://talksport.com/football/1099718/chelsea-sir-jim-ratcliffe-bid-man-utd-fan-simon-jordan/,Simon Jordan calls Sir Jim Ratcliffe a ‘disruptor’ for Chelsea bid and warns Manchester United fan ‘not always successful’ in sport,"Simon Jordan labelled Sir Jim Ratcliffe a ‘disruptor’ for his 11th hour bid for Chelsea. Todd Boehly’s consortium is understood to remain on course to be confirmed as the preferred bidder and then handed the opportunity to seal a Stamford Bridge takeover from Roman Abramovich. The Russian oligarch put the club up for sale in March amid Russia’s war in Ukraine, but was later sanctioned by the UK government and had his assets frozen. Chelsea were still able to operate on a special licence with New York-based merchant bank The Raine Group handling the process overseeing the sale. The Treasury will have to ratify the club’s sale for the eventual takeover, but significant progress has been made with LA Dodgers co-owner Boehly expected to be named the preferred bidder. That was until Britain’s richest man, Ineos owner Ratcliffe, confirmed a last-ditch £4.25billion bid for the club. Manchester United fan Ratcliffe carried out extensive due diligence on Chelsea in 2019, only to opt against submitting a formal offer to buy the west London club. The British billionaire had distanced himself from a bid for Chelsea in early March, with his brother Bob reiterating previous determination at Ineos not to be ‘dumb money’ in football.  But crucially, Ratcliffe never categorically ruled himself out of a bid for the Blues. Former Crystal Palace owner Jordan does not believe that Ratcliffe’s bid will succeed and the £4.25billion figure quoted is not quite all it seems. When asked why Ratcliffe has made the late bid, Jordan told talkSPORT: “No idea… being a disruptor? His bid is the lowest bid. He hasn’t bid what the other guys have bid. “The other guys have bid near to £3billion and he has bid the £2.5billion, which was supposedly the price people were to get to and bid a future commitment of £1.75billion. A future commitment, which I’m suspecting the other guys will spend just as much as he’s forced to spend. “If they are going to develop the stadium, which I suspect they are all going to, they are all going to the same place. “He’s had ample time to get in a situation where he could have done this. Whatever has prompted him behind this?  “You also have the Todd Boehly bid, the make up of that and who is behind it. There are some very interesting people, not necessarily financially well heeled, but people who are intellectually well heeled like Danny Finkelstein. “It’s going to be Todd Boehly and his gang, those are going to be the guys who come out of it. “Jim Ratcliffe, whenever he gets involved in sport it is not always the greatest success. He wasn’t the greatest success with Ben Ainslie over the Americas Cup, but the man has significant wealth.  “He’s a Manchester United fan, not that that influences who you can and can’t own. “If he wanted to be involved in this process, he could have been at some point and probably didn’t want to be at the table in a bidding auction with other people, but this bid that has been dressed up as £4.25billion… what you spend in the future has nothing with what you buy the football club for. “There are two things. The price you’ve got to pay to own this business and what you project to spend in the future, that’s for the birds.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

https://talksport.com/football/1094930/man-utd-news-paul-scholes-jesse-lingard-premier-league/ ,‘I don’t know why I did it’ – Paul Scholes regrets revealing Jesse Lingard conversation but believes Manchester United have treated the midfielder poorly,"Paul Scholes admitted he regretted revealing his conversation with Jesse Lingard where the midfielder labelled the Manchester United dressing room a ‘disaster’. United have come under fire following their defeats to Liverpool and Arsenal in the space of five days as they look set for their worst Premier League season on record. The club legend made the comments while working as a pundit after the loss to the Gunners, but on reflection felt perhaps he should have kept that conversation private. Scholes told talkSPORT: “I’ve had a little bit of stick for that. I don’t know why I did it! Honestly, sometimes words just come out your mouth. “I have spoken to him since and probably best I don’t tell you what he said.” Scholes also criticised the club for how Lingard has been treated in the recent weeks and months. The midfielder was all set to move from the club in January, before it fell through at the 11th hour. He is out of contract in the summer and looks likely to make a permanent exit from Old Trafford.  Scholes added: “I think Jesse has been treated pretty poorly by the club, to be honest. He was ready to sign for Newcastle at one point and West Ham, right at the end of deadline day and he was told he was going to get more minutes. “That clearly hasn’t happened. He’s deserved a chance. We all saw what he did at West Ham. He’s a really good footballer and can bring goals to a team and with this team playing so poorly as well, for him not to get a chance… I think he’s unfairly treated.” But Scholes admitted there could still be a way back into the Manchester United first-team under new manager Erik ten Hag.  Ten Hag will join from Ajax in the summer and the former midfielder thinks a player like Lingard could flourish under the Dutch manager. “I think he might suit him [Ten Hag] and he might want to keep him,” Scholes said. “We will see what happens. “It’s obvious he never wants to leave Manchester United, and if this manager wants him then why wouldn’t he stay?” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.
