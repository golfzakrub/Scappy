The 20-year-old is the latest youngster to break into Villa's first-team ranks and cement his place in the starting XI. Ramsey has enjoyed an exceptional Premier League campaign following on from his breakthrough season last term. He has made 31 league appearances for Villa this season and has started all but one of Steven Gerrard's first 22 games in charge of the club. The England Under-21 has scored six goals and is also the club's joint-second top goal scorer this campaign.

As a product of the Villa academy, the midfielder has been with the club since the age of six and progressed through the ranks. And when asked how much of a lift it gives him when supporters are chanting his name, Ramsey replied: ""Obviously being a local lad, I’ve been going to Villa Park since I was the age of eight now. ""I know what it’s like to sing those songs, when I was singing about Jack (Grealish), so now for the fans to sing it about me, it gives me a real buzz to go out and play. I think especially in front of my friends and family to hear the fans singing my name, it’s a good feeling."" Speaking of Ramsey, Villa boss Gerrard told BirminghamLive: ""I've been very aware of the Ramseys because of how well this club did in the Youth Cup. They obviously played Liverpool in the final and I was aware of the commentators speaking of the Ramsey brothers, also the Carneys (Chukwuemeka) and Tims (Iroegbunam), those around the game. ""It probably wasn't until Arsenal away where he curled one into the top corner. I really liked the technique of that goal. I think that was the moment where I thought, 'Ooh!' ""To score a goal like that, in an environment like that at Arsenal at that age, that is normally a moment, being a lover of the game, where it makes you think, 'Hang on a minute, this kid might be a player!' ""Then, obviously Dean (Smith) played him some more before I arrived but it's not until you get up close and personal with someone on the training pitch and you see his level and potential, you see the human being... That's when you get really excited about the talent. ""I've said it quite a bit. I don't want to keep talking JJ up. I want him to play his football and to protect him and manage him in the best possible way but, without a doubt, he's someone I want to build around this club moving forward."" ",positive,arsenal,2

https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-st-andrews-stadium-23843590,Birmingham City's best and worst away days with Fulham and Hull standing apart,"We all have a favourite football ground, usually the home of the team we support. And whether it is a shining example of everything a football ground should be or a right dump doesn’t matter. After all, it is our dump and that’s what counts. Of course, Blues fans have something of a love-hate relationship with St Andrew’s for a while now, or at least with those people tasked with keeping the famous old ground in reasonably decent nick. Blues have been operating at a reduced capacity for the whole of the 2021/2022 campaign, with the ground requiring expensive remedial works. But whatever the rights and wrongs behind the problems at St Andrew’s, it remains the their spiritual home and means just as much to most supporters as the swankiest of big-money stadiums at the likes of Spurs and Arsenal. READ MORE: 'We're happy' - Manager addresses striker future amid Birmingham City links READ MORE: Birmingham City fans left baffled by 'update on update we are waiting for' on St Andrew's safety work But then there are those other grounds we have a hankering for - those of footballing foes which spark warm feelings because of a brilliant victory there or a favourite incident, the culmination of a promotion success or huge cup upset. These days, as more and more modern stadia spring up across the country, another category of favourite springs to mind - those old-fashioned grounds that help carry us back to another era, complete with towering stands, hostile crowds thrust right to the edge of the pitch and the brilliant atmospheres that football should be all about. So, our question to you is what are you favourite football grounds and which are the ones you loathe? For Blues fans, St Andrew’s is always going to be the beating heart, even if two of those heart chambers aren’t even functioning at present. The reopening of the lower tiers in the Kop and Tilton stands cannot come quickly enough because something needs to be done about the atmosphere. But where else do Blues fans feel ‘at home’? Blues writer Brian Dick says: “The recent trip to Blackpool, a sunny Easter weekend by the seaside, was a real opportunity for 3,500 supporters to let their hair down. Unfortunately the team let them down too. “The biennial trips to yo-yo club Fulham are always fun, Blues take a huge following and pack out the away end. Crossing the city to the other place is always something to look forward to. Derby away is always, always eventful.” So they are the good grounds, but what of the ones Blues fans dislike? Brian adds: “In terms of stadiums Blues fans loathe, it depends to be more a personal thing. Reading away is pretty soulless, matches tend to be midweek 8pm kick-offs in a half empty gr0und. “Blackburn’s Ewood Park is always cold and Hull is a long journey, there’s nothing remarkable about the ground and results are always terrible. Elsewhere, West Ham’s London Stadium isn’t really fit for purpose as a football venue.” Now it's time for you say. If the survey below doesn't load, click here.

https://www.football365.com/news/ravanelli-spurs-premier-league-title-conte-manchester-united-new-defence,Ravanelli claims Spurs can win title next season and Man Utd need a ‘whole new defence’,"Fabrizio Ravanelli reckons Spurs can win the Premier League title next season but admits they will have to “fight hard” to achieve that under Antonio Conte. Tottenham have been much better in the second half of the campaign under Conte with the Italian replacing Nuno Espirito Santo at the beginning of November. Nuno left the club after they lost five of his last seven Premier League matches in charge with Spurs sitting ninth in the Premier League. Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Tottenham are now up to fifth under Conte, two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal with the race for the final Champions League spot well underway. And Middlesbrough legend Ravanelli reckons Spurs have a chance of winning the Premier League title next season with Conte at the helm. Ravanelli told The Sun: “I believe he has been doing very well at Tottenham but when a coach, especiallyConte, gets to a team, he needs time. I’m pretty sure he can make tremendous progress and achieve exactly what he has in mind. “Tottenhamhas always been missing something – they never really manage to take that necessary step forward in quality. They have had a good mentality but it’s not been effective in getting the results they want. “Now withConte and Fabio Paratici, they will be able to make the right choices to give them the right identity to win. They will be able to then possibly win thePremier Leaguein this way. Next year will be the turning point.” Ravanelli added: “This year they have less chance than Arsenal [to get top four] but knowing Conte, in these moments, he always wins duels. He is so focused and so determined and I’m pretty sure they will finish fourth and get into the Champions League. “As for winning the Premier League next year, they will have to fight hard. We cannot forget Manchester City and Liverpool. Tottenham have got seven or eight excellent players. “They need to focus on the defence because that is their main weakness. They would also need to strengthen the midfield with new signings and sign a new striker to play alongside Harry Kane. “Kane is the best but he is not enough so they will need to strengthen there next season. It won’t be easy.” Conte was linked with the Man Utd job before taking over at Spurs and Ravanelli reckons the Red Devils need huge changes in the summer to progress under Erik ten Hag. Ravanelli continued: “If Conte had had the possibility to work with theManchester Unitedplayers, certainly it would have been easier for him to achieve certain results. “United have many players who are not fit to wear the shirt or up to the expectation of winning the Premier League and Champions League. There should be some turnover of players. “I don’t want to be nasty but honest. Without naming specific players, the whole defence should be changed completely. It needs radical change. “I truly believe withErik ten Hag, a new cycle is about to start. He did really well at Ajax and enjoyed remarkable results. “He has always given great value to young players. If he starts working with the young players who understand what it means to play for United, they can make the difference and improve.” ",positive,arsenal,2
https://www.football365.com/news/henry-criticises-arsenal-for-treatment-extraordinary-player,Henry criticises Arsenal for their treatment of ‘extraordinary’ player –  ‘he didn’t have a chance’,"Gunners legend Thierry Henry has criticised Arsenal for their treatment of their “extraordinary” defender William Saliba. Arsenal paid £27m to sign the centre-back from Saint-Etienne in 2019. He is yet to make his debut for the Gunners. After spells at Saint-Etienne and Nice, the 21-year-old joined Marseille on loan before this season. Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Saliba has been one of the standout players in Ligue 1 this term as he has played 49 times for Marseille across all competitions. His form for Marseille led to him making his senior debut for France earlier this year. The defender stated last month that there is ‘a chance’ that he will spend another season at Marseille. Henry feels for Saliba as he was forced out on loan before making an error for Arsenal: “They didn’t even let him make a mistake,” Henry told Amazon Prime. “He left before an error. He didn’t even have the chance to compete for his place. “What he is doing here is extraordinary. He was rewarded with a selection for the France team. “At the moment, he belongs to Arsenal, I don’t know where he will end up. We have seen that it was a little difficult for him to express himself on the subject. “What I know is that he could have been in the Arsenal group. I am not Mikel Arteta, but I found it difficult for him. Anyway, he responded well and that’s the most important thing.” Elsewhere,Darren Bent has said that he would like to see Mikel Arteta stay in charge of Arsenal next season regardless of how they do during the rest of the season. “There are still a lot of Arsenal fans who are unsure about Mikel Arteta being in charge of Arsenal Football Club. “They still think, come the end of the season, regardless of whether Arsenal are in the Champions League or not, he should not be the manager to take them forward. “I completely disagree. I think he is the right manager to take them forward. He’s earned the right to move into next season, certainly if Arsenal are in the Champions League.” ",positive,arsenal,10
https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-ten-players-down-back-premier-league-sofa-thriving-gomez,Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving,"As the Premier League season enters its final weeks, clubs have started looking deeper into their squads to find a few hidden first-team gems. 10) Juan Mata (Manchester United) The sofa is knackered and living off past glories, while the item dredged from its innards is a little wornand being imminently shifted, but it remains perfectly serviceable and somehow incredibly handsome for an inanimate object. Juan Mata joined the reigning Premier League champions for a club-record fee and will leave them stranded in the Europa League, yet the Spaniard’s reputation has not been even vaguely damaged by eight-and-a-half years wasted at Old Trafford. It seemed to take Manchester United that long and almost as many managers to figure out how best to utilise Mata, who excelled as a No.10 against Brentford on his 15th Premier League start in the last three seasons. Considering those who have been permitted to float around in the sea of mediocrity and been rewarded, his relative lack of recent use has been startling. This renaissance itself is pointless, coming as it does so soon before his departure as a free agent. Yet the contrast between how well Manchester United play with Mata in the side compared to their disjointed performances without a player of his calibre remains telling.  9)Fabian Delph (Everton)The use of players on deals with a looming expiration date can often be polarising. But Everton supporters will likely give no second thought to Fabian Delph’s contract status, provided he continues to help in their quest for survival. The midfielder started three of 19 Premier League matches under Rafael Benitez and none of Duncan Ferguson’s single-game interim reign. Frank Lampard appreciates the “honesty” of a two-time title winner and hoped in April that Delph would be capable of “carrying on with what he did against Manchester United” before necessary discussions over his future were held. The 32-year-old has held up his end of the bargain, replicating those leadership qualities and defensive instincts that thwarted United in a 1-0 win at Goodison Park to secure the same result against Chelsea. Delph also started the 1-1 draw at home to Leicester and will retain that starting place provided his hamstrings hold up.  8)Tim Iroegbunam (Aston Villa)“I thought Tim had some really good moments today. I think you can see the profile, what he is going to become,” said Steven Gerrard, who added after Tim Iroregbunam’s full senior debut against Norwich: “We need him to realise that he is a first-team player. He needs to use his voice more, he needs to keep pushing himself on a daily basis.” There are worse former Premier League midfielders to receive constructive praise from. A cynic might argue thatIroregbunam’s reward for being able to “out-train certain individuals” was timed impeccably for the visit of Norwich, yet the 18-year-old embraced the challenge and further smoothed that pathway Jacob Ramsey first trod. Iroegbunam was upgraded from four Premier League minutes against Brighton in February to a quarter of an hour at Leicester and then a start in the Norwich victory, having been an unused substitute in 14 of the prior 16 fixtures. He failed to make the squad altogether in the other two; that is unlikely to happen again soon.   7)Nathan Collins (Burnley)The alchemy of Sean Dyche might have wavered at Turf Moor but the last season of signings during his reign could have established Burnley’s spine for the next few years. Maxwel Cornet and Wout Weghorst have finally added some new dimensions to the attack, while Aaron Lennon and Wayne Hennessey have been useful enough as elder statesmen. But the purchases of Championship prospects Connor Roberts and Nathan Collins may be the most important of all; both were eased into the side and neither look likely to relinquish their places. Collins has been a particularly influential arrival. Burnley have won five and drawn four of the 14 Premier League games he has started; they have won two and drawn nine of the 20 he has not. Dyche never gave the centre-half more than three consecutive starts but Collins has not missed a single minute of Mike Jackson and company’s caretaker reign. The 21-year-old’s impact has even allowed Ben Mee to step comfortably into that role and the forthcoming exit of James Tarkowski need no longer be of great concern. The reimagining of Burnley’s defence has already started.  6)Oleksandr Zinchenko (Manchester City)The third signing of Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City tenure still has his uses to the Spaniard almost six years later. His first, Ilkay Gundogan, has become a midfield lynchpin at the Etihad, while Nolito was the opening transfer misfire of this monumental reign. Oleksandr Zinchenko’s first-team relevance has never been particularly settled – the most appearances the Ukrainian has ever made in a single Premier League season is 20 – but he can still be relied upon when needed. That has been a little less often this season. Fifteen starts in all competitions represents a low return for Zinchenko, whose Manchester City minutes for the campaign rank in between those of the similarly peripheral Nathan Ake and the fading Fernandinho. The only teams to beat Guardiola’s side when Zinchenko has started are West Ham, Leipzig and Liverpool, stretched across three different competitions. As the season reaches suffocatingly pressurised levels at the top, the 25-year-old can still slot in at a moment’s notice with no discernible detriment in quality.  5) Joe Gomez (Liverpool)The full circle that has been Joe Gomez under Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool is close to completion. Injuries scuppered the defender’s development initially and are the primary reason for his current role as dual back-up. When the German first brought Gomez, it was as a right-back in 2017/18, designed to eventually share the right-back position with Trent Alexander-Arnold by the end of the season. His current status seems to be generally restricted to filling in when the Liverpool academy product needs a rest. Perhaps next he will rekindle the fruitful centre-back partnership with Virgil van Dijk upon which the Reds won the Premier League title. The list of clubs Gomez has started against is revealing: Milan, Benfica, Watford, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest, Preston, Leicester and Norwich three times. It reflects his bit-part function in this winning machine. But Klopp has challenged his squad players to be “ready for the moment when the situation changes” and throughout his regular appraisals of those on the fringes, Gomez is almost always the first to be mentioned. The 24-year-old would start in most other Premier League defences; serving consistent time on the Anfield sidelines will not be a permanent arrangement either way. 4)Mads Bech Sorensen (Brentford)Sixteen Brentford players have featured more often than Mads Bech Sorensen so far this season, but the Danish centre-half might slowly be rising to prominence. Before Boxing Day his campaign was limited to 19 minutes of the opening win against Arsenal. He then started three straight games until January 2, was benched for a couple more matches and returned to face Manchester United as February approached. Ten consecutive fixtures either on the bench or out of the squad altogether followed, before Ethan Pinnock’s injury at Watford opened a first-team door that had been irregularly blowing barely ajar for months. Sorensen finished that Vicarage Road victory, retained his place in the goalless draw against Tottenham and was arguably the best Brentford defender on show at Manchester United, even if that bar remains low in a 3-0 defeat. He,Saman Ghoddos andMads Roerslev have been critical utility players who might have earned Thomas Frank’s trust during their respective stop-start campaigns.  3)Nathaniel Clyne (Crystal Palace)It has been a curious few years for Nathaniel Clyne. Brendan Rodgers signed one of the Premier League’s most dependable right-backs for Liverpool in 2015, and while Klopp might have been plotting an internal upgrade at some point, it was injury that eventually took him out of the side. A back problem suffered in summer 2017 effectively ended Clyne’s time as a regular starter; another pre-season injury, this time to his cruciate knee ligament in July 2019, signalled his quiet farewell the following year. The 31-year-old had left Crystal Palace for Southampton in 2012 but came back as a free agent and trialist by October 2020, training with his former club to regain fitness and soon a 12-month contract that was renewed last August. Clyne has had to accept a subsidiary role under both Roy Hodgson and Patrick Vieira; he didn’t feature in the Premier League from February to December 2021. But an injury to Joel Ward presented an opening that has reinvigorated the erstwhile England international’s career. Clyne’s current run of 10 consecutive Premier League starts is his longest in five years and an enduring testament to his fortitude. Even if Palace intend on sourcing an improvement at right-back in the transfer market, they could do worse than renew Clyne’s terms as a trustworthy reserve. Nathaniel Clyne appreciation tweet The guy doesn’t stop trying, goes about his business quietly, and has been absolutely solid for us Proper palace ❤️💙 pic.twitter.com/rOfwPYvqRH — Benj (@Beniesta_) April 30, 2022   2)Moises Caicedo (Brighton)Graham Potter perhaps understood the unique pressure of having to live up to such a daunting Barclays surname. Felipe Caicedo struck terror into the heart of Premier League defences for two years at Manchester City and surnamesake Moises would have to carry that burden for the rest of his career. Brighton signed the midfielder for £4.5m in February 2021, sat him on the bench as an unused substitute in five Premier League and FA Cup games, nodded astutely as his Ecuador side reached the Copa America quarter-finals, then sent him on loan to Beerschot in Belgium for some season-long fine-tuning. Except Caicedo would return to the coast sooner than planned. An injury to Enock Mwepu and the loss of Yves Bissouma to Africa Cup of Nations duty led to a midfield shortage at Brighton, the solution to which was a January recall for Caicedo. The Seagulls battled through that period regardless and only for the trip to Arsenal did the 20-year-old finally get his long-awaited debut. Brighton’s seven-game winless run was curtailed at the Emirates as Caicedo shone, assisting one goal and displaying the sort of quality Potter has found impossible to resist since. The midfielder has started each of the subsequent four matches as the next stage of Brighton’s transformation comes into full view.  1) Mo Elneny (Arsenal)“Maybe there wasn’t a lot of competition because we were the only club interested in signing him. Not too many people spoke about him and he was basically not much on the radar,” said Arsene Wenger, really milking the excitement of the Arsenal fanbasein January 2016. Plenty of teams have pursued the Egyptian since, from Leicester to Galatasaray and, most recently, Newcastle. A productive year was spent at Besiktas, yet the Turkish giants thought better of exercising their buy option. And so Elneny returned in summer 2020, farmed out under Unai Emery and inherited by Mikel Arteta. The Spaniard has consummate faith in Elneny to deliver when called upon. He started the Community Shield final win over Liverpool almost two years ago, as well as wins at Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge. Heading into this season it was believed that the midfielder would finally leave, yet even when Arteta culled the squad with ruthless abandon, he knew Elneny would be needed at some point. The Egyptian’s only Premier League starts this campaign have come against Manchester United (twice), Chelsea and West Ham and no player has been more crucial to their turnaround over the past fortnight. Elneny’s contract is scheduled to expire this summer but, by his own admission: “If Arsenal say ‘we want you’ I don’t think about leaving. It’s my family for six years. I love this club.'” Arteta will reciprocate that fondness; he could not find a better or more committed and reliable squad option if he tried.  ",positive,arsenal,5
https://www.football365.com/news/mailbox-liverpool-quadruple-man-utd-rangnick-brentford,Would this season be a success if Liverpool won one out of four from here?,"The Mailbox ponders how Liverpool’s season will be viewed if they don’t win any of the three remaining trophies they are going for this month. Get your views in to theeditor@football365.com… What qualifies as Liverpool success? I think it’s pretty crazy that Liverpool could finish the season as FA Cup finalists, champs league finalists, runner up in the league and winner of the league cup and pretty much every fan will think of it as a failed season. Myself included. By any other standard any two of those four achievements is a superb season for 99% of teams. Which I guess highlights just how high Klopp has raised our expectations now. I said after we drew with city that the title was gone. That was a must win game. My friends (also reds) said I was pessimistic and city would def drop points along the way and we would win every game. Winning every game for us at that point would mean a 14 game winning streak, one of the longest in club history. So far we’ve done that. But pep just knows how to put giant runs together and looking at the calendar at the time I couldn’t see any teams taking points off city. Still don’t. 4 games left and it’s looking ever more likely that the season will finish with city being one point above us and that game Vs city being a costly one (though really any game we dropped points is just as costly). But I genuinely believe (as objectively as I can) that we will win a cup treble this season. Regardless of who makes it to the final it will be a very tough game with either two teams who play fast attacking football and a high tempo pressure game filled with talented players or Liverpool against a team of dark arts masters who are older than the Bible with twice the staying power. Would other Liverpool fans be disappointed with a cup treble? I want to say no but I know in my heart of hearts that that premier League trophy is the one we really want. I’d swap the champs league for the premier League this year for sure. I shouldn’t be disappointed, especially considering only a few years ago we almost ceased to exist. But I know that pang of regret will be there anyway…Lee  Eye on the ballIsaac, believe me, my eye is very much on the ball. I am making no assumptions about Liverpool winning their last 4 games. In fact in my mail on Sunday I said it was a real possibility that they wouldn’t. I am very worried about the game against Tottenham, just as I was worried about the Newcastle game, worried about the Man United game, worried about the Everton game and worried about pretty much every other game Liverpool play. I do find the comment about the ‘ridiculous’ concern from Liverpool fans about where City could drop points slightly odd though. Isn’t that what football fans do? Are Spurs, Arsenal, Leeds, Burnley, & Everton fans not scouring the fixtures list to see where points may be won and lost? Seriously, if you’re not doing that are you even a real football fan?Mike, LFC, London   Everton relegation bad for Man City Not only would Everton’s relegation be bad for the city it would also be bad news for Manchester City. As it stands City only have the Manchester derby as the game where “form goes out of the window” but Liverpool have two, with the Merseyside derby and the rivalry with United. It is rare that Liverpool actually do the double over Everton (this season aside) and it is hard to imagine a promoted team taking points off them. With the margin between the two being so small, Everton’s relegation might make all the difference next season and (perish the thought) beyond.CDM  Departing manager bounce 29th of April – Rangnick appointed Austria manager for next season. 2nd May, Man United play their first convincing game of Rangnick’s tenure, displaying flair, composure, and effort. It turns out these players can play, and they can defend, and score goals too. Coincidence? Or motivation? And if you believe it was ‘just Brentford’ consider that if United had played this way and won all the games we played against teams in the bottom half of the premiership we would have had 16 points more. Contrary to popular opinion, this team doesn’t need surgery. It needs a spark.Ved Sen, MUFC.  Ralf finds the formula Man Utd finally played good football. Huge shout outs to Mata & Matic. All the others players have 100% and it showed. Is it a coincidence Man Utd plays good football without Maguire & Rashford? The former simply doesn’t deserve to be in a top six team, the latter is a footballer turned book writer who can’t be bothered to run on a football pitch. If only Ralf had found this formula earlier. CheersAshwin – Man Utd fan  Where did all the nicknames go? Two things which have been rolling around in my head recently – What ever happened to nicknames for players? It feels like they are not as prominent anymore. In the past, here in sunny and loadshedded South Africa, we had wonderful nicknames for players like Ace, Computer, and my favourite, Lucas ‘Masterpieces’ Moripe. According to Wikipedia, Steven Gerrard is referred to as the ‘Hammer of Huyton’. I can’t recall ever singing for the ‘Hammer’. ‘Scores from forty yards’, uncountable times. Was he referred to as the Hammer at all up in England? I know Luis Suarez went by ‘El pistolero’ but this seemed to be more widely used for him in Uruguay? Maybe Salah’s ‘Egyptian King’ moniker might currently be applicable but in truth, are nicknames still assigned? I’d love if we could start calling them James ‘the Anvil’ Milner and Joel ‘Pureclass’ Matip. My second mental wandering I confine to brackets.

The Ajax boss has reportedly agreed terms in principle with United but is yet to be officially announced as their next permanent manager. Gossip: Manchester United linked with Premier League trio It is thought that confirmation of Ten Hag’s decision to swap the Eredivisie for the Premier League will come after the upcoming Dutch Cup final this weekend, which will see his side face PSV Eindhoven. With the 52-year-old’s arrival looking imminent, a number of stars have been linked with the club as they look to rebuild on what has been another disappointing season. United have made it five consecutive seasons without a trophy after a campaign of turmoil on and off the pitch and could miss out on qualification for the Champions League next season. Arsenal and Spurs are currently ahead of the Red Devils in the race for the top four. Whether the prospect of no Champions League football next season will affect who the club will target this summer, it remains to be seen. However, that wont stop a number of players from around the globe from being linked with a move to Manchester. ESPN are reporting that the latest name to be on the Man Utd shortlist is Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni. The Frenchman, who has already made eight appearances for the senior national side at the age of 22, has been in fine form in Ligue 1 this season. His performances have drawn attention from a number of top sides around Europe, including Liverpool, Chelsea and Juventus. The 22-year-old now appears to be on the shortlist for manager-to-be Ten Hag as he looks to improve what has been a troublesome position for a number of years at Old Trafford. This season Scott McTominay, Fred, Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba have all vied for a starting role in initially Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side and, more recently, under Ralf Rangnick. Tchouameni’s international teammates Pogba is out-of-contract in the summer and doesn’t look likely to agree a new deal whilst Matic, at 33, is hardly a long-term solution. Scotland international McTominay and Brazilian Fred have improved this season but if United are to take the next step and begin challenging for titles again, they will need reinforcements and Monaco’s Tchouameni could be brought in to do just that. It is also worth mentioning that Donny van de Beek, who is currently on loan at Everton, could feature more prominently next season after working under Ten Hag at Ajax. ",positive,arsenal,1

Tchouameni was named Ligue 1’s Young Player of the Year last season after a breakout campaign which saw him start all but two of Monaco’s league games. The 22-year-old’s accomplished displays as a deep-lying midfielder caught the eye of clubs such as Chelsea, Man Utd and Real Madrid, all of whom retained their interest going into the January transfer window. The financial insanity must stop; football needs recalibration A report last month insisted that Liverpoolare now ‘more interested’ in Tchouameni than AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessieas they look to boost their engine room in the summer transfer window. Over the weekend it was claimed thatLiverpool and Man United ‘have asked’ about the France international’s availability and Tchouameni ‘would not see the option [of a Premier League move] badly’. And now Spanish publication Marca (via Sport Witness) reckon that Liverpool are now ‘placed in the lead’ for Tchouameni along with rivals Manchester United and Manchester City. Meanwhile, Liverpool beat Nottingham Forest 1-0 on Sunday as they moved into the semi-finals of the FA Cup with Jurgen Klopp’s men excelling in all competitions. Diogo Jota’s 78th-minute goal secured a first win at Nottingham Forest’s City ground in 13 visits – succeeding where Arsenal and Leicester had failed this season – to book a Wembley date with Manchester City on April 16. Getting past Forest, in the first meeting between the two clubs in 23 years, proved difficult enough. Had Philip Zinckernagel not missed a one-on-one with goalkeeper Alisson Becker a couple of minutes before Jota struck the outcome could have been different. “It was the game we expected, especially if you don’t use your chances,” Klopp said. “We could have played better, but we should have scored in the first half. If we scored earlier it would be a completely different game. “All respect to Steve (Cooper) and Nottingham Forest, a top, top performance, really professional, really well organised. ““It was a brilliant atmosphere. Everything was prepared to give us a knock as well but because we were prepared for a fight we came through.” ",positive,arsenal,1

It is understood that Juventus are another team interested in the midfielder but thatTchouameni would not be willing to move to Serie A at this point in his career. The big rivals to the two Premier League sides comes from Spain, though, with La Liga giants Real Madrid eyeing upTchouameni as a replacement for Casemiro. He has been the subject of a number of ‘juicy offers’ already with the 22-year-old ‘aiming for the Premier League’. Meanwhile, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp knows Andy Robertson is “desperate to deliver” as the left-back was landed with even greater responsibility in the wake of Trent Alexander-Arnold’s absence. With the Reds’ marauding right-back, who has provided two goals and a career-best 16 assists this season, sidelined for a number of weeks with a hamstring injury, the emphasis will switch heavily to the Scotland captain on the opposite flank. While he has not been as prolific as his counterpart he was man of the match in Wednesday’s defeat of Arsenal, setting up the important second goal for Roberto Firmino. “It is the full package of Robbo, not only as a player but a person as well. He wants desperately to deliver and work for the team,” said Klopp on Friday. “Even though he and Trent set up a lot of goals, there is still space for improvement in the decisive moments. “The goal (at Arsenal) was one of our favourite goals for a long time; first we win the ball back and second Robbo is waiting with his cross until he saw Bobby is now ready for it. “It was an incredible pass in the end and Bobby had to do a lot to get it past (Aaron) Ramsdale. “Yes played a really good game.

Son grabbed his second of the game and 19th of the season in style as he curled a 20-yard effort into the top corner to put the seal on Spurs’ victory. Spurs settle another set of jitters with a masterclass from Son Heung-min He had earlier set up Harry Kane’s opener from a corner and doubled the lead when he turned and shot on the hour mark. The quality of the goal left Conte wondering which was Son’s strongest foot, but the Italian said moments like that will only count for something if Spurs achieve their goal of finishing in the top six. “I gave him a big hug because after an amazing goal my question was which is his favourite foot, right or left?” Conte said. “He scored a fantastic goal and three minutes before when I spoke with him I said, ‘Go for five or six minutes and then I have to make a change’. “I said to him that when you listened that I wanted to make a change and you decide to score this amazing goal. “We are talking about a great player, fantastic player.

Otherwise it remains only a personal success only to score these types of goals.” OH SONNY YOU BEAUTY — Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) May 1, 2022 The victory saw Spurs get back on track in their quest for Champions League qualification after taking one point in their previous two games. Conte knew it was especially important to win as they visit title-chasing Liverpool next weekend. “It was a good performance against a really good team,” he said. “The game wasn’t easy and we knew very well that despite them making eight changes from the last game against Roma you can see the quality, you can see the squad that Leicester has. “I think then we deserved to win the game. “For sure we got three points in an important moment of the season, especially because in the next games we are going to face first Liverpool and then Arsenal. “Today it was vital to get three points. There is only one result and a lot of pressure, but I said to my players to live this moment, to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months. “I think no one at the start of the season could imagine Tottenham challenging for a place in the Champions League, especially in November when there was a change, and for this reason we have to be satisfied that we stay in this position to fight for a big achievement.” ",positive,arsenal,1

Spurs are two points behind Arsenal with five games to go and Conte has called on a joint effort to get over the line. “In this moment our fans, me, the players, the club, the fans we need to be focused, we need to be concentrated on an important target for us,” he said. “We have a big opportunity to try to get a place in the Champions League. “It’s a big opportunity for us because no one can imagine to stay and fight for this target in this league now in this moment. In the past it was different, but now you know very well what I said in the past that it would be a miracle to get this achievement. “We are doing something special for the situation we faced this season. I spoke with my players and its the same with our fans, they have to continue to support us and push us until the end. “We’re living this dream. We have to continue until the end to get a place in the Champions League. It’s right to underline that we are fighting for a target that wasn’t in our mind at the start of the season. “For this reason I want to push everybody at the club to have great enthusiasm, great passion, our fans to stay with us and to back us from the start until the end. “Now it would be very important to be focused and not listen to fake news and the people that for sure want to create problems for the environment. “We have to play these five games and then you know, because I answer a lot of times, that at the end of the season in a private way I will speak with my club and I will see the best solution. “We’re working very hard and my players know very well we’re very focused. We’re speaking a lot about this opportunity. “We have to live this situation with passion, enthusiasm and joy. I repeat, we deserve to stay there and to fight for a place in the Champions League.

Spurs have been improving since Conte took over in early November to replace Nuno Espirito Santo, who lost five of his last seven Premier League matches to leave the club ninth in the table. Since then, Tottenham have gradually risen up the table and now find themselves fifth, two points off fourth-placed Arsenal with five matches to play. Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters Spurs have the Gunners to play in the north London derby in a fortnight’s time with the match probably going a long way to deciding which of the two teams will play Champions League football next season. However, there have been rumours that Conte could jump ship this summer whatever happens in the final straight with a report insisting that the Italian has offered himself to Paris Saint-Germain. Pochettino is almost certain to leave this summer, with the manager and PSG attempting to agree a compensation package which would allow him to depart, as the French giants would have to fork out€15m to sack him. The report on Monday claimed that there has also been ‘contact’ between Pochettino and Daniel Levy with the Tottenham chairman ‘trying to convince the coach to return to Spurs’. And now the Daily Mail say that Tottenham are ‘looking at alternatives’ to Pochettino if Conte attempts to exit this summer ‘withGraham Potterand Roberto Mancini among the names set to be considered’. It is understood that Pochettino is ‘largely viewed as the ideal candidate to replace the Italian’ but ‘there is some opposition from within the Tottenham hierarchy’ to his potential return. That ‘resistance has led the club to explore other avenues’ with Potter and Mancini emerging as possible options. Brighton manager Potter was linked with a move to Spurs in the summer when Nuno was appointed and just before Conte’s arrival in north London. The Daily Mail adds that Tottenham have ‘long admired the work Potter has accomplished at Brighton and will be on the club’s radar if they find themselves trying to replace Conte this summer’. Mancini, who is currently manager of the Italian national team, is also ‘an option’ with Spurs’ managing director of football Fabio Paratici ‘an admirer’ of the former Manchester City boss. The Daily Mail adds: ‘It’s important to stress that Tottenham’s due diligence towards the appointment of Conte’s successor remains a matter of contingency preparation, with sources indicating succession planning at football clubs is completely normal. ‘Indeed, Tottenham’s plan A is for Conte to stay in charge heading into next season – and there is a feeling behind the scenes that he will not walk away.’ ",positive,arsenal,1

The former Chelsea boss replaced Nuno Espirito Santo at Spurs back in November. Tottenham’s fortunes have improved since Conte took over. He has won 17 of his 31 games in charge across all competitions. Is Pochettino a better manager for Spurs than Conte? Spurs are in the running for a Champions League place. They are two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal with five games to go. It was reported earlier this week that Conte has ‘offered himself’ to PSG. The Ligue 1 side are currently managed by former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino. The Argentinian is under pressure at the moment. PSG are 13 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 but they were dumped out of the Champions League by Real Madrid. The Athletic have noted that reports linking Conte with PSG have ‘irritated’ Levy. Tottenham experienced a similar ‘distraction’ in 2020/21 when Harry Kane announced that he wanted to leave before the season concluded. They add: ‘There is generally a desire at the club to block out the noise and get on with it. ‘There is also an acceptance that volatility is part of the package when you appoint Conte, and that the focus has to be on the team overcoming their recent blip and qualifying for the Champions League. It’s also inevitable that when you have one of the game’s elite managers, they will be linked with other clubs — especially when you are not in the Champions League yourselves. ‘That said, there are some who feel Conte has hardly dampened speculation over the last couple of months, given the way in which he’s refused to talk about his future at Spurs beyond the immediate term. ‘As for the players, with no midweek fixture they were given pre-arranged days off on Sunday and Monday, and are not expected to have been too affected by the reports. ‘In general, Conte is very popular with the players, though there have been times, most notably after the post-Burnley meltdown in February, where they have been unsettled by the up-and-down nature of their head coach’s mood.’ ",positive,arsenal,1

Of course, it would be a ‘fantastic achievement’ but ‘it won’t be any greater than Tottenham’s Double in 1960-61, Arsenal’s in 1970-71, or Liverpool’s in 1985-86’. We’re fascinated to hear how four trophies are actually no better than two, apart from ‘because it were better in the olden days’. We’re fascinated to hear how Arsenal’s 1970-71 side – who crashed out of the League Cup and Europe – are actually the equal of a team that wins all four trophies available at a time when they are up against the greatest club side of the last decade. We’re fascinated to hear how Liverpool’s 1985/86 side – barred from Europe but beaten by mid-table QPR in the League Cup –are actually the equal of a team that wins all four trophies available at a time when they are up against the greatest club side of the last decade. And then comes ‘Manchester United’s Treble in 1998-99 which, pound for pound, would still be the greatest achievement of all’. Why? Even the staunchest United fan would have to agree that four is a bigger number than three. United won the title with 79 points, a total surpassed by Liverpool and Manchester City this season with several games to spare. They also won the FA Cup and the Champions League but they lost in the third round of the League Cup. And yet that is still the better achievement than winning all four trophies? Because everything was better when Stan was playing? Collymore offers literally no explanation why United winning three trophies is better than Liverpool potentially winning four, other than a lack of ‘financial doping’, which kind of ignores two things: 1) United spent rather a lot of money to win those trophies and 2) The ‘financial doping’ of Manchester City, United and Chelsea in modern times makes it even more remarkable if Liverpool win four trophies. He then writes that when he played, ‘Matt Le Tissier spent his career with the Saints, but he’d have been taken on by one of the big boys after a couple of years these days’, to which we offer the words ‘Harry’ and ‘Kane’. We could also point out that Le Tissier turned down several moves away from Southampton but actually, we have already given that argument more credence than it deserves. ‘Spurs, Arsenal and Kenny Dalglish’s Liverpool all hit the heights with smaller squads than Jurgen Klopp’s Reds and City have at their disposal today’. They hit smaller heights with smaller squads at a time when all their rivals had smaller squads too; Spurs played 49 games to win their double and Liverpool have played 56 games already. You’re comparing apples with oranges and deciding that pineapples are better.  Done Ron Ron Ron ‘At least you can rely on Cristiano Ronaldo to lift the spirits,’ writes Neil Custis in The Sun. ‘A sparkling display, capped by his 24th goal of the season from the penalty spot, gave Manchester United fans something to cheer. In fact, he has probably given them the only things to cheer this season.’ Is this the same Ronaldo and indeed the same Neil Custis that collided to bring us these words in February? ‘The truth that is now staring everyone in the face, and clearly Ronaldo himself, is that his days as a top-class footballer are over. ‘It has been an admirable battle against father time but he is now losing it.’ ‘Losing it’ and yet now, less than three months later (and three months older for Ronaldo), ‘they need him still, even at 37, as they look to the future’. But, but, but… ‘The problem, though, is that when the ball is at his feet, or on his head, there is no magic any more, it has all gone.’ It’s almost like – and stop me if this is blowing your minds – Ronaldo had a blip in form at the same time as Manchester United were utterly atrocious and he is now neither completely finished nor the future for United. But why acknowledge middle ground when you can lurch wildly between extremes? Somebody give Custis one of those heated lavender packs to treat his whiplash.   Fergie timeHeadline on The Sun website as Ken Lawrence writes about – and we had to check this – a 3-0 victory: ‘Man Utd verdict: Final home game played against backdrop of depression and disillusion, it’s a far cry from Fergie days’ It’s been nine f***ing years; get over it. ‘For the last home match of the season came agains the backdrop of depression and disillusion at a club that under Sir Alex Ferguson ruled the Premier League and on a couple of occasions did so in Europe too. ‘This is a very different United to the one Fergie guided to 13 titles, two Champions League successes and so much more silver wear.’ ‘Silver wear’ has made us laugh at least (it’s the pick of about 427 mistakes, including a description of Ronaldo as a ‘waining star’ and a brief discussion of ‘parametres’), but the rest of this is utterly miserable. It is a ‘very different United’ but how many times can that be written? Thousands, it seems. Manchester United have not had a very good season, but a 3-0 win over Brentford gave Lawrence the chance to write about the farewell of Juan Mata or maybe the promise of Anthony Elanga. That he watched that victory and essentially wrote ‘this Manchester United is not as good as Fergie’s Manchester United’ says a great deal about tabloid journalism and its obsession with a past in which they were still relevant.  Do one, Ron, RonKen Lawrence on The Sun website: ‘Ronaldo does not fit those parametres no matter that he had a sparkle about him against Brentford in what was his best all – round performance in months. ‘And in those months there have been hints for months that without Champions League football next season he will head off. ‘He certainly won’t want to be involved in the Europa League or perish the thought, playing in Europe’s third tier Conference.’ Ken Lawrence on the back page of The Sun: ‘CRISTIANO RONALDO dropped his biggest hint yet that he wants to stay at Manchester United – after mouthing: I’m not finished.’ That all seems perfectly clear.  Down, down, deeper and downElsewhere in Stan Collymore land, he seems to think that Burnley’s survival absolutely would not reflect badly on the recently sacked Sean Dyche, in fact ‘the opposite because every player at Turf Moor is a Dyche player’, and yet Leeds’ relegation would be down to ‘the over-egging of the Marcelo Bielsa pudding’. Now try and hold both of those opinions at the same time without getting a throbbing headache.  ",positive,arsenal,3

WARD-PROWSE TO MANCHESTER Free-kick whizz-kid James Ward-Prowse has caught the attention of both Manchester United and Manchester City, who are reportedly interested in luring him away from St Mary’s this summer. United want to land two new central midfielders as part of a summer overhaul under new manager Erik ten Hag, and Ward-Prowse is among those on the club’s wishlist, according to the Daily Star. And it’s claimed the Red Devils will face direct competition with rivals Manchester City, as Pep Guardiola is a ‘huge admirer’ of the England international. The City boss described the 27-year-old – who has scored from four free-kick’s this season – as the best dead-ball specialist in world football and has been impressed by his box-to-box displays and incredible fitness record. Newcastle, Tottenham and Arsenal are also ‘tracking developments closely, while Aston Villa failed with a £25m bid for the midfielder last summer. The report concedes that Ward-Prowse is settled at Southampton but may decide to switch to a club playing European football to improve his chances of going to the World Cup in Qatar. It’s thought he would cost up to £60m.  MOUNTING CONCERN Chelsea are a bit concerned Mason Mount could be tempted to leave the club for Liverpool or Manchester City, who could take advantage of the club’s ownership crisis. It looks as though what the proces to replace Roman Abramovich is nearing its end, though it’s felt that way for a while. Despite Jim Ratcliffe throwing a lot of late cash in an attempt to buy the club, it appears Todd Boehly’s consortium are on the verge of tying up the deal. But for now, Chelsea are unable to offer their players new contracts. Mount, despite his importance to the club, is currently one of the lowest paid players in Thomas Tuchel’s squad, on around £70,000 per week. He has two years left on his current deal, but The Sun claim ‘concerns are growing’ that he could be tempted away by a more lucrative contract, with both Jurgen Klopp and Pep Gurdiola ‘major fans’ of the 23-year-old. Chelsea apparently planned to open talks of a long-term deal before Abramovich was hit by the sanctions, but they will have to bide their time with the future of the club still up in the air.  BUMPER JAMES DEAL Offering Mount a new deal should undoubtedly be a priority when the new owners are in place, and among the other players the club are desperate to keep is Reece James. 90min claim Chelsea have made the right-back’s future a priority as they look to ward off interest from Real Madrid. James has become a key member of Tuchel’s side in the last 18 months, registering five goals and six assists from wing-back this term, and the club is ready to offer him a ‘new bumper deal’ as reward for his fine performances.

The 21-year-old has put in a number of exceptional performances for the French side this season, playing 43 times in all competitions forJorge Sampaoli’s outfit. Saliba was allowed to leave Arsenal on loan in the summer with a number of players ahead of him in the pecking order at the Emirates Stadium. Early losers: Average Arsenal playing averagely However, his recent call-up to the France national team has seen rumours that he could return to the Arsenal first team next campaign. His future remains undecided though and, ahead of talks with Arsenal over his future, Saliba has given Marseille fans hope that he could be around again next season. “There is always a chance,” Saliba told Le Parisien. “I do not hide that I am very happy in Marseille. “I have developed, I have passed a milestone. If I make it into France’s squad it’s thanks to Marseille, because there is a lot of visibility. “They are a very big club with a lot of pressure, but when you’re good there are a lot of good things that happen to you. “We will see in May or June depending on the discussions. Today, my future, I don’t know what it is.” It is not the first time Saliba has commented on his future with the centre-back insisting in an interview with L’Equipeearlier this month that he doesn’t want to be sitting on the Gunners’ bench next season. Saliba said: “They are often in contact with my agent. They send me messages. They watch my matches. They tell me that we have to continue like this. “I haven’t played much with the Gunners. The coach has made his choices, that’s life. I left on loan, I put the matches together, and I became an international.

https://www.football365.com/news/bent-disagrees-arsenal-fans-over-huge-arteta-future-call,Pundit ‘disagrees’ with ‘a lot of Arsenal fans’ over huge Mikel Arteta decision,"Darren Bent would like to see Mikel Arteta stay in charge of Arsenal next season regardless of how they do during the rest of the season. The Spaniard’s time at the Emirates Stadium has been full of highs and lows with the Gunners winning the FA Cup in his first six months in charge. It was disappointing first full season in charge at Arsenal for Arteta as they finished eighth in the Premier League, missing out on qualification for Europe. Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature However, six new signings last summer helped Arteta remould his squad for this season and they are now favourites to finish fourth and secure Champions League football for next term. Arsenal – who beat West Ham 2-1 on Sunday – are currently two points ahead of Tottenham with four games left of the season, including a north London derby, which could go a long way to deciding who will finish fourth. Despite that, there are still a number of doubters among the Arsenal fanbase that Arteta is the right man to lead the club forward in the long term, but Bent thinks they should keep the faith. Bent said on talkSPORT: “There are still a lot of Arsenal fans who are unsure about Mikel Arteta being in charge of Arsenal Football Club. “They still think, come the end of the season, regardless of whether Arsenal are in the Champions League or not, he should not be the manager to take them forward. “I completely disagree. I think he is the right manager to take them forward. He’s earned the right to move into next season, certainly if Arsenal are in the Champions League.” Meanwhile, former Arsenal striker Kevin Campbell claims that Nicolas Pepe, who has been linked with a move away from the club in recent weeks, doesn’t have a future at the Emirates Stadium. Campbell told Football Insider: “Arsenal paid over the odds for him. “It has just not worked out. It is that simple. He is a talented player, that’s for sure. But it has not worked out for him. “You see the intensity and focus that Mikel Arteta wants the team to play with. I don’t think Pepe fits into that. He is a drifter. He will concentrate for a bit and then drift out again. “I said just before Christmas it was a big few months coming up for Pepe. It was going to determine whether or not he had a future at Arsenal. Well, he doesn’t have a future at Arsenal.” ",positive,arsenal,12

Having been frustrated in the first half, Jurgen Klopp’s side scored two quick goals within ten minutes of the restart to hand them a healthy advantage heading into the second leg. F365 says: Liverpool sidestep another obstacle that could hand them boost for title as well as Europe Henry believes the Reds “weren’t showing a lot” beforePervis Estupinan got in the way of a Jordan Henderson cross and deflected the ball into his own net. “If you look at the game, I think a lucky goal bailed them out, for me,” said Henry. “I think they would have knocked on the door, if not all night. “It’s a lucky goal, the own goal of Villarreal is a lucky goal and I think, before that, they weren’t showing a lot. “But, along the way, I would say, when you are going for the quadruple, then you need to have that luck. And, after that, there is nothing about luck.” Meanwhile, the BT Sport pundits believe the tie is still just about alive. “Villarreal have just got a pulse,” Owen said. “If Liverpool nicked another one it would have been game, set and match.” “I think three would have killed it, that would have been too much for Villarreal to come back from,” Peter Crouch echoed. “Two is a possibility but it’s a slim, slim chance when you watch Liverpool in the form they’re in at the moment.” And Owen believes Klopp made a mistake in bringing Joe Gomez on for Trent Alexander-Arnold with then minutes to play as he felt Liverpool should have gone for the jugular. “I thought he made substitutions that almost didn’t promote going for an extra goal,” Owen said. “Joe Gomez for Trent for starters is much more defensive when your right-back is one of the most attacking players you’ve got on the pitch. “I thought maybe not that he was settling for two, but I thought he was comfortable and rested a couple of legs. “They’re going to have to go out there knowing that the game is still alive. It’s still got something in it. If they concede the first goal, it’s really alive. An extra goal tonight would have put it to bed.” ",positive,arsenal,1

The winger is expected to leave PSV this summer. He has revealed that he wants to play in the Premier League: “The Premier League is a big league.

You have to create something else as a team, create a mentality and look for the details in the preparation. “Against a team that is normally better, we will be dominated for seventy or eighty minutes but there will remain 15 or 20% of the match during which you will have chances and that is what we will work on. “I impose the same demands on myself here as in Seville, at PSG or Arsenal.

https://www.football365.com/news/decision-time-one-loanee-dilemma-saliba-van-de-beek?utm_source=Recirculation&utm_medium=WP_Related_Articles_Unit&utm_campaign=Benchmark,Decision time: One loanee per club sparking a dilemma,"A genuinely interminable international break plus a France debut for William Saliba was all the encouragement we needed to embark on a quest to identify one player per Premier League club currently out on loan who, for better or worse, has given his parent club a decision to make… Arsenal: William Saliba The Gunners have a whole gaggle of assorted players out on loan, and, despite the intriguing existence of Folarin Balogun as a striker whose Arsenal contract isn’t about to expire, the most interesting loanee is once again William Saliba. He was here last year and if anything the intrigue has only grown. He has now had three hugely successful years as an Arsenal player; he just hasn’t spent any of them at Arsenal. Loans at St Etienne, Nice and now Marseille have even earned him his first caps for France. Friendly caps might not seem all that big a deal, but winning a cap for France as a centre-back is just about the toughest task in the entire sport; Aymeric Laporte found it so difficult he had to become Spanish instead; Ibrahima Konate still hasn’t managed it. Saliba, the man apparently surplus to requirements at Arsenal, has done it. He is understandably happy and settled at Marseille, where he plays every game, and a return to Arsenal would mean fighting for a place with Gabriel and Ben White. A lot depends on the player, but with only two years left on the five-year contract Saliba signed as a teenager, Arsenal are now very much at the point where it’s time to sh*t or get off the pot.  Aston Villa: Matt Targett One of many players currently on loan – along with Keinan Davis, Trezeguet, Anwar El Ghazi and Frederic Guilbert – who Villa are seemingly happy to move on permanently in the summer. Targett is key, because it appears relatively straightforward to do a deal with Newcastle that suits all parties while also bringing in a reasonably sizeable transfer fee – something in the order of £15m has been mooted – to help bankroll Steven Gerrard’s ambitious summer masterplan of spending £60m on Kalvin Phillips.  Brentford: Marcus Forss The Finland striker was in the squad for every one of Brentford’s first 23 Premier League games. But he started just one of those, getting off the bench in just six others and never for more than 30-odd minutes. He scored no goals. He went back to the Championship on loan with Hull in January and has managed just a single goal in eight appearances for the Tigers. He’s still got four years left on his Brentford contract; it’s hard to see how he can be part of what will almost certainly again be a Premier League squad next year, but you can also see why he’d be reluctant to leave the security of that long-term contract. Another loan?  Brighton: Kjell Scherpen The Seagulls have 13 players out on loan like some kind of petrodollar superclub. At least one of these will definitely be in the squad next season, surely – striker Deniz Undav who has scored only one league goal fewer for shock Belgian league title contenders Union Saint Gilloise before and after a January sale-and-return move than his new Brighton team-mates have managed to put together in the Premier League. A more interesting one might be giant back-up keeper Scherpen, who might have been doing a more important off-field role in the first half of the season than many realised. Scherpen spent the first half of the season watching Robert Sanchez be very good indeed and is now on loan while Sanchez makes repeated bollocks of things as Brighton’s season threatens to end with the sort of whimper that can have alarming knock-on effects the following year if not addressed. Even if he doesn’t play a single game, Scherpen might be worth keeping around the place.  Burnley: Bailey Peacock-Farrell We’re not spoiled for choice here. It’s a third-choice goalkeeper or a fourth-choice goalkeeper. Let’s go with Peacock-Farrell who is doing a decent enough job in nets for fallen giants Sheffield Wednesday as they look to clamber out of League One. Our main observation is that it doesn’t matter how many games of football he plays or at what level. No matter how high his career goes we will never, ever, ever accept that Bailey Peacock-Farrell is not in fact the name of a rugby player who, after six successful years in Super League, crosses codes to join Bath or whatever and make eight appearances for England in the 15-man game.  Chelsea: Conor Gallagher There is not a single Chelsea player currently on loan at Vitesse, which is perhaps why the whole world currently seems to be desperately trying to spin itself off its axis. It’s just not right or normal, is it? Chelsea do, though, have about a million players out on loan as is customary. Now the whole global unpleasantness is of particular relevance to Chelsea, who may not in fact have any choice to make over who stays or goes or heads out on loan. They may not even exist next season. Probably they will, though. And probably they will get to decide these things. Which means a decision to make on Gallagher, who has been one of the most exciting and enjoyable players in the Premier League this season. We’re big fans of players who get to that level and still seem to visibly enjoy playing the game. Palace would, clearly, dearly love to keep him and you do get a keen sense that this is now someone who needs to be playing regularly. You can’t keep him on the bench, released only for the odd runaround in a Carabao or non-vital European game. He’s tasted regular top-level football now and found it entirely to his liking. At the very least, you’d think he needs to spend another year on loan playing all the football.  Crystal Palace: Luke Plange Palace only have two players currently out on loan and it’s fair to say their summer thoughts might be rather more exercised by what happens next to the player they currently have on loan (see above). Anyway, the two options are a) 23-year-old American Jacob Montes who has spent the entirety of his slightly odd one-year Palace contract pulling up no trees in a pair of half-season loans in the Belgian second division and therefore b) Luke Plange, the teenager whose breakthrough at Derby convinced Palace to make a buy-and-return move in January. Palace have a bit of form for developing Football League talent into Premier League players, but you’d imagine that’s probably a way off yet. A good Championship loan seems the likeliest option next season.  Everton: Moise Kean In theory, he’s still in the first year of a two-year loan at Juventus with an obligation to buy at the end of it. In theory. In reality, Juventus weren’t right sure a while ago and since signing Dusan Vlahovic are less convinced still about the merits of Kean who has scored just four goals in 24 Serie A games this season. All the noise suggests Juventus are looking to get out of the current arrangement and send Kean back to Goodison this summer, an outcome that we have to imagine absolutely nobody else involved wants. So whatever happens next it should be fun to see what comes of it all.  Leeds: Helder Costa In and out of the side at Valencia but has made no secret of the fact he’s happier in Spain and would like to make his move permanent if everyone else is up for it. They probably will be. “I feel better here, I came from a not so good situation (at Leeds). But Valencia have given me the opportunity to relaunch my career and I think this is the ideal place to do that,” Costa toldSuper Sport last year.   Leicester City: Dennis Praet A victim of the Dreaded Metatarsal, which has kept him out of the Torino side for a couple of months at a frustrating time and appears likely now to be a season-ender. The Belgian is apparently happy in Turin and keen to stay, but the Italian side seem keen to use his injury as a means to drive down the agreed £12.5m option price in the current loan arrangement. Reports from the Italian end suggest Torino might favour another loan over an outright purchase but, with just two year left on his Leicester contract, you’d imagine the Foxes would want something more concrete built into that. An obligation that kicks in once a set number of appearances is reached or some such thing. We don’t know. We’re not contract negotiators.  Liverpool: Nathaniel Phillips It’s between Phillips and Neco Williams here. Both will still have three years left on their contracts in the summer. Both are on loan at high-flying Championship clubs. Both have obvious talent. Both face significant top-quality barriers to their first-team progression at Anfield. But it’s Phillips, five years Williams’ senior, for whom the clock is more conspicuously ticking. Phillips did an admirable job in that desperate half-season for Liverpool last year when all their other centre-backs fell over, but is that situation going to present itself again? Should Bournemouth confirm promotion back to the Premier League, and that appears almost certain now given their sizeable cushion in both points and games in hand over third-placed Luton, you’d imagine both player and club might be keen on a more permanent arrangement. Ticklish thing there is that longish contract, half a season of decent Premier League football behind him and apparent absence of any option in his loan contract. What would Liverpool want for him? £15m is a number that has been touted, and if anything you’d be surprised if it was that low really.  Manchester City: Pedro Porro Just the 13 City players currently plying their trade elsewhere at the mo. Spain right-back Porro is perhaps the most interesting of those, currently in the second half of a successful two-year stint in Lisbon with Sporting that has already brought one league title and could yet bring another if a six-point gap to Porto can be overturned. Eight goals and nine assists from 65 games played predominantly at right wing-back are eye-catching numbers.  Manchester United: Donny van de Beek The arrival of a new manager in the summer means all things are a bit up in the air for United’s current loanees, who could suddenly find themselves far more in favour when a new man arrives. We suspect minds have been made up now, though, about Anthony Martial. Van de Beek is an intriguing one, though. Especially if United’s new manager does turn out to be his former Ajax gaffer Erik Ten Hag in spite of Louis van Gaal’s mischief-making. Van de Beek is clearly a talent, but whether he can crack it here remains in some doubt. What is not is that he is yet to be presented with an environment to categorically prove it one way or the other. In hindsight – and, if we’re honest, foresight – packing him off to Frank Lampard’s Everton Circus might not have been a brilliant idea. We’re still really none the wiser about him.  Newcastle: Freddie Woodman If you were loaned out by Newcastle in January then really it’s a pretty clear hint about where your future lies. For Woodman, who played four Premier League games at the start of the season, it’s meant sitting on the bench for promotion-chasing Bournemouth as back-up to Mark Travers. It is the seventh loan of his Newcastle career, and he has one year left on his contract at St James’ Park. At 25, it’s surely time for a permanent move to go and be first choice somewhere even if it means dropping down a tier or two.  Norwich: Todd Cantwell Like Norwich themselves, he’s pretty good at getting into the Premier League but not so good at staying there. With his current loan club Bournemouth set to once again swap divisions with parent club Norwich, the logical conclusion is surely for Cantwell to go back to Norwich and complete what would be the genuinely novel achievement of a third successive promotion from the Championship. Bournemouth do, though, hold the option of making the move permanent and spoiling everything.  Southampton: Dan N’Lundulu Because there is literally nobody else other than a 23-year-old striker who scored two goals in 20 League One appearances across a pair of loans at first Lincoln and then Cheltenham before suffering a season-ending hamstring injury.  Tottenham: Bryan Gil Spurs have seven players out on loan, and with most of them the future looks pretty clear one way or the other. It would be a major surprise were Tanguy Ndombele or Giovani Lo Celso to have futures in north London, which is a shame but also probably for the best. Neither has been missed since January. Jack Clarke was Spurs’ attempt at a moneyball signing and it’s not worked out. Cameron Carter-Vickers is likely to make his loan move to Celtic permanent. Pape Sarr, the teenage midfield sensation bought from and loaned straight back to Metz last summer, will require a decision but not a final one. The suspicion there is that he’ll spend pre-season with Spurs before either being brought into the first-team squad or sent on another loan. Spurs, you’d imagine, would prefer that to be to either a bottom-half Premier League club or ambitious Championship side (let’s face it, it will probably be Norwich) to find out how he goes in English football. But the big decision probably regards Bryan Gil, the skilful yet painfully lightweight Spanish winger who just looked nowhere near the right sort of fit for English football. His current loan in Spain cannot tell us much but he is the one player on the Spurs list where all things are possible. This time next year he could just as easily be a Spurs first-team regular, starring for Valencia in La Liga having joined on a permanent basis, doing bits for Crystal Palace on loan or languishing at Tottenham having subsisted on the occasional Europa night which is no longer an option because Spurs have found some new and absurdly Spursy way to get knocked out. Watford: Philip Zinckernagel The Hornets look to be on to a good thing whatever happens here thanks to Zinckernagel’s Nottingham Forest exploits. He’s scored five goals and laid on nine assists to help Forest into the play-off picture, but it’s his eye-catching displays in Forest’s fabulous FA Cup run that really make you take notice. If Watford stay up, then he has shown he can play at Premier League level. If they go down, then he has shown he can propel a Championship promotion bid. And if Watford go down and Forest go up, then they might be able to sell him for a nice price. Win, win, win. If you ignore the whole ‘relegation’ stuff, which is not a win and frankly a bit of a downer.  West Ham: Conor Coventry Because he’s the only West Ham player currently out on loan. They really don’t have a very big squad. The 22-year-old spent the first half of this season in the lower reaches of the Championship, making 12 appearances – mainly off the bench – for Peterborough, and is now in League One with MK Dons. Has just a year left on his contract at West Ham, for whom he has made three brief appearances off the bench in the League Cup.  Wolves: Adama Traore All appeared sorted when he set off to Barcelona initially on loan with a £29m option to make it permanent in the summer. Four assists in 10 games have gone some way to confirming the suspicion that his end-product stats might improve away from Wolves but there is yet a fly in the ointment thanks to Barcelona’s much-publicised financial problems making that £29m a bit steep for them. Wolves have made it clear that Traore is done at Molineux unless there’s a surprise U-turn on a new contract and even then Wolves may feel he’s burned his bridges. Spurs were keen in January, but might have moved on now. Could get tricky, this. ",positive,arsenal,7
https://www.football365.com/news/tottenham-add-potter-mancini-shortlist-pochettino-doubts-conte-future,Tottenham add two managers to their shortlist as doubts grow over Conte’s future,"Tottenham have added Graham Potter and Roberto Mancini to their list of possible alternatives to Mauricio Pochettino as doubts grow over Antonio Conte’s future at the club, according to reports. Spurs have been improving since Conte took over in early November to replace Nuno Espirito Santo, who lost five of his last seven Premier League matches to leave the club ninth in the table. Since then, Tottenham have gradually risen up the table and now find themselves fifth, two points off fourth-placed Arsenal with five matches to play. Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters Spurs have the Gunners to play in the north London derby in a fortnight’s time with the match probably going a long way to deciding which of the two teams will play Champions League football next season. However, there have been rumours that Conte could jump ship this summer whatever happens in the final straight with a report insisting that the Italian has offered himself to Paris Saint-Germain. Pochettino is almost certain to leave this summer, with the manager and PSG attempting to agree a compensation package which would allow him to depart, as the French giants would have to fork out€15m to sack him. The report on Monday claimed that there has also been ‘contact’ between Pochettino and Daniel Levy with the Tottenham chairman ‘trying to convince the coach to return to Spurs’. And now the Daily Mail say that Tottenham are ‘looking at alternatives’ to Pochettino if Conte attempts to exit this summer ‘withGraham Potterand Roberto Mancini among the names set to be considered’. It is understood that Pochettino is ‘largely viewed as the ideal candidate to replace the Italian’ but ‘there is some opposition from within the Tottenham hierarchy’ to his potential return. That ‘resistance has led the club to explore other avenues’ with Potter and Mancini emerging as possible options. Brighton manager Potter was linked with a move to Spurs in the summer when Nuno was appointed and just before Conte’s arrival in north London. The Daily Mail adds that Tottenham have ‘long admired the work Potter has accomplished at Brighton and will be on the club’s radar if they find themselves trying to replace Conte this summer’. Mancini, who is currently manager of the Italian national team, is also ‘an option’ with Spurs’ managing director of football Fabio Paratici ‘an admirer’ of the former Manchester City boss. The Daily Mail adds: ‘It’s important to stress that Tottenham’s due diligence towards the appointment of Conte’s successor remains a matter of contingency preparation, with sources indicating succession planning at football clubs is completely normal. ‘Indeed, Tottenham’s plan A is for Conte to stay in charge heading into next season – and there is a feeling behind the scenes that he will not walk away.’ ",positive,arsenal,1

The Belgium international came off the bench for the last 20 minutes against the Red Devils at Old Trafford but failed to impact the game. Lukaku has now failed to score in his last ten appearances in the Premier League with his last goal in the competition coming at the end of December against Brighton. Transfer gossip: Man Utd to move for free-agent Dybala while Arsenal target Rashford After signing for £97.5m from Inter Milan in the summer transfer window, Lukaku was expected to hit the ground running at Chelsea but has managed just ten goals in 37 appearances in all competitions. And Keane didn’t like what he saw from the Chelsea striker on Thursday night with the Man Utd legend expecting Lukaku to attempt to prove a point against his former club. Keane said on Sky Sports: “He’s come on against Man United, he was [a player] here, so you think, ‘I’ll show them my qualities’. He came on and again, just ambling along, not that determination to get himself a goal. As much as his fitness levels, I think his attitude doesn’t seem right.” 🗣 “His attitude doesn’t seem right.” Roy Keane on Romelu Lukaku’s performance for Chelsea tonight pic.twitter.com/jd0dp8EZZp — Football Daily (@footballdaily) April 28, 2022 Meanwhile, Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel was frustrated that his side didn’t take all three points against Man Utd on Thursday with the Blues failing turn their chances into goals. “A little bit (frustrated not to win),” Tuchel said with a smile. “We were very strong on and off the ball, very dominant on the ball, very aggressive off it. “A lot of ball wins, a lot of deliveries, a lot of half chances, a lot of spaces we found around the box. “But unfortunately we lacked precision in the box, a bit of determination to finish it off, even very early in the match, but also throughout the whole match. “Unfortunately when we had it we gave it away in one minute, so it started all over again. “But reaction was good again, so I am very happy with the performance because it was a huge team effort. “I think we showed what it needs to win on a big stage, in a big stadium, like on the focus level and the physical input level. “We played with a huge team effort with a lot of quality, but unfortunately we don’t have what we deserved, so we have to live with a point.”  ",positive,arsenal,1

Get your views in to theeditor@football365.com… Why Evertonians are behind Lampard There’s been an awful lot of guff about Frank Lampard on these pages recently, from your writers and mailboxes alike. Some of it borne out of rivalry; some, presumably, out of jealousy and spite. (Why on earth would a fan of another club care whether he deserves the EFC job or not, if such a thing could even be assessed?) So, I thought I’d try to articulate why I and many other Evertonians are inclined to defend him. Firstly, the mess at the club is not his fault. Our squad was compiled by no less than 8 different managers, together with 2 different DoFs and 2 board members who each have/had their own opinions. Some of those people were absolutely useless at their jobs. Many of the managers have opposing styles and some even seem to have been appointed as a direct reaction to the previous (different) playing style not working out. One mailboxer said that Lampard has had access to resources many clubs can’t dream of. Has he though? We are hamstrung by FFP rules now and he joined with only a few days of the transfer window remaining when we’d already conducted most of our business at the behest of the previous manager and DoF (a fine example of the complete lack of planning at the top level – I mean, selling Luca Digne to please Benitez and then firing Benitez almost immediately afterwards really takes le gateau). We had a world class number 10 in Rodriguez whom Benitez banished to the gulf because of a grudge held since they were in Madrid together many years ago and our other number 10 has been dropped from the squad because he’s [redacted for legal reasons]. Our best defender (Mina) has legs made of cheese and our main striker has been injured for much of the season and now seems more bothered about chasing modelling gigs than loose balls in the box. Secondly, there are reasons to like and have faith in what he says. Martinez was unrelentingly positive to the point of gaslighting, Allardyce tried to claim Unsworth’s results as his own, Koeman seemed to think he was above it all and Benitez was thoroughly dour (and was never going to be one of us) but Frank genuinely seems pleased to be here and is actually telling it like it is. Yes, he has complained about refs but we’ve had some shocking decisions go against us during his tenure and he’s not made a habit of it like many others do. When we’ve played well, he’s complimented the team; when we’ve shown a complete lack of bollocks, he’s not been afraid to call them out too. F365 has picked up on him pointing to the state of results before we came but he’s right – they were absolutely shite. Thirdly, there are signs that we are moving in the right direction. We are playing passes around again (ok, except against the red shite), pressing again and showing some fight again. Iwobi looks like a different player, Gordon is improving by the week (needs to learn to stay on his feet, mind), Mykolenko seems to have settled nicely now and we’ve even seen flashes (if only flashes so far) of what Dele Alli can do. The challenge is achieving consistency now and preventing Keane and Holgate from being distracted by passing bumblebees. Who knows? Stranger things have happened. Finally, well, sooner or later we’ve got to back someone right? I’ve had friends who follow other clubs tell me that we should sack him and bring Allardyce back for the last few games. To me, that’s madness and the exact sort of knee-jerk decision making is what got us into this mess in the first place. Maybe Lampard will prove to be a very good manager, maybe he won’t and we’ll get relegated. Either way, though, I believe he deserves a proper chance (and from you lot too). BestPhilT Big Weekend: Newcastle v Liverpool, Phillips against Man City, Arsenal, Lampard faces Chelsea  Is Klopp’s Liverpool’s greatest-ever signing? I write this moments after the news of Klopp signing of a new contract that keeps him at the club until 2026. I was so happy that I can’t remember the last time I was this happy about a current LFC employee signing a contract extension. It got me thinking, is Jurgen Klopp the greatest signing in the history of LFC? There are many contenders but for me it comes down to three, Kenny Dalglish, Bill Shankly, Jurgen Klopp. I’m not old enough to have seen a Bill Shankly side but we obviously know his legend and my dad has told me enough times to know what this man did for the club, he took us from the old 2nd division and made us the champions three times under his stewardship as well as two FA cups and a UEFA cup. But it wasn’t just the trophies he won that made him so revered, as we’re seeing with Klopp now he changed the whole ethos of the club, he turned a crumbling local football club into league and European champions and what he put in place stayed for years and helped turn the club into behemoth we see today. Again I was too young to see Kenny Dalglish play in his pomp but from old video and tales off my pops I know all too well that he was one of the greatest players to ever pull on a red shirt. He won 7 league titles and 3 European cups as well as a number of FA/league cups. He was a magician with the ball at his feet and scored some wondrous goals and to this day my dad says there will never be another Dalglish, he said that Suarez came closest to what Dalglish brought to the team. What sets Dalglish apart is that he transferred his winning playing style to management too winning the league twice and two FA cups as manager. He was also the rock that the whole city clung to in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster. He’s still a massive figure at the club today with a stand named after him and all the respect and adulation that he deserves. Jurgen Klopp. What else can I say that hasn’t already been said, the man is a genius and much like Shankley before him he rejuvenated a sleeping giant and turned us into one of if not the best side in Europe for a number of years winning the league and Champions league in the face of financially doped opposition. He’s put into place an ethos and a system that should see us well for years after he leaves and he’ll leave a lasting legacy on the club much like the men I’ve already mentioned. So to answer my question, is Jurgen Klopp the greatest signing in the history of the football club? No, not yet. That title goes to Sir Kenneth Mathieson Dalglish but for Klopp just be in the conversation with him and Shankley speaks volumes. To the mailbox, who is the greatest signing in the history of your club?MickT Liverpool  Second place is first loserDom Littleford, no-one cares about the second tallest man and no-one who isn’t a Liverpool fan will have them as a great team for Rumbelows cup wins or losing the league by 11mm (trust Liverpool fans, inventors of the net spend league and the VAR league to add a further measure of total irrelevance just to make them sleep better at night. How about a slip measure too?). Trophies are what matters and now it is pretty much just winning the league or Champions league that really matter in terms of going down as a good side. Even the FA Cup is only the 3rd most prestigious trophy for an English club. That’s not to say any premiership team wouldn’t love to be lifting that trophy at Wembley, especially those not in the top 2 places currently. Ask Greg Norman about greatness. Ranked number one golfer in the world for a total of 331 weeks (over 6 years), only surpassed by Tiger yet “only” won two majors. Because of this he is not even close to a conversation of the greats. There’s a big difference in being great and actually achieving greatness. Without the trophies to back up a claim you’re just an old man with biased rose tinted memories. And “the two best English clubs of all time” – LOLJon, Cape Town (it is difficult enough to separate those that win trophies making discarding those without them very easy)  …Dom’s email was perfectly reasonable in most of what it said, but I think it misses the basic point that most people are making; it’s not that this season’s Liverpool team wouldn’t be considered great, but that they’d have no claim to be amongst the very greats/the greatest. Take the 2016 Golden State Warriors in basketball Vs the 1996 Chicago Bulls. The Warriors had the better record (73 wins, 9 losses), to the Bulls 72-10, but crucially, they lost in the finals, whilst the Bulls won. The raw number might have showed they were better statistically, but so what? When the pressure was really on, they couldn’t get the job done. If Liverpool were to get 100+ points this season and finish second, not winning anything bar the Carabao, they’d be the greatest amongst all of the failures and almost greats in sport. They’d be right at the top of the list of teams that were so close, yet couldn’t get the job done. They’d be admired and revered in much the same way Charles Barkley’s Phoenix Sounds are – wonderful losers. They’d go down as another “if only…”. It’s also ludicrous to suggest a team that got 7 extra points but didn’t win the league could ever be remembered as being greater than the Invincibles, or even as great. Arsenal won the league comfortably, scored the most goals, and kept the most clean sheets. A fair number of the draws came towards the end of the season, when it was clear that going undefeated was within touching distance. They survived the pressure of achieving that historical feat. Liverpool didn’t. They finished a mighty second. A behemoth? Has there even been a behemoth quite like Sir Alex’s Man Utd? Let’s not belittle by trying to overly compare eras. It’s also petty to single out a Pires moment to retract from it. Can we not arbitrarily pick out any number of moments in any team’s season to say “they wouldn’t have done it but for X, Y, Z”? There will always be that element of luck, or something “wrong” contributing along the way to anything like that. Klopp’s teams have certainly had their moments. This isn’t about being the second tallest guy in history. It’s more so about being the second tallest that year, let alone in all of history. You could reasonably argue that some of the Real Madrid teams that finished second to Barca were great, but you hardly hear mention of them now that years have passed – and so it should be. Second won’t make them the second greatest team in history, nor does winning the league this year make Pep’s team the greatest ever. Tall as they are, if Liverpool her dunked on by Pep’ team, that will be what everyone remembers, except the nostalgic Liverpool fans who still go on about “if only Gerrard hadnt slipped…”. Enjoy,Soheil.  Stopping Salah Alot of comparison of Grealish and Salah’s rates of getting fouled per minute, foul per dribble or whatever in the afternoon mailbox – is it racism, Liverpool bias or whatever (I’m not getting into that). Isn’t the big factor that people are overlooking style of play? It seems to me that Salah gets fewer fouls because he’s good enought to power through and just score a goal instead. When I watch Grealish, he doesn’t really try and score goals, or create goalscoring opportunities, I honestly think that he’s playing almost exclusively to try and draw a foul. People are trying to suggest that there should be direct correlation between quality of player and fouls won, but while difficulty to play against is clearly a factor, its not the only factor. Someone flagged that Messi gets fouled significantly less often than Grealish and for me, that says everything. For Messi, a good days work is bagging a couple of goals and maybe an assist. For Grealish, its luring at least four people into kicking his shin in attacking areas. Salah is more Messi than Grealish – that’s a good thing!Andy (MUFC)  …Has anyone considered that Mo Salah’s low fouls per minute / per dribble / per whatever are so low because the guy is the world’s best and nobody can get close enough to him to foul him? Same can’t be said for Grealish, Gordon or anyone else. Seems like an obvious explanation.Mark, LFC, Hong Kong  …Lots of people upset at me suggesting Salah gets fewer decisions because of the colour of his skin. There’s lots of unconscious bias in every aspect of our lives. There are numerous studies that prove it (e.g. people with certain types of names being less likely to be invited to interviews, having a certain skin colour resulting in it being more likely you’re searched by the police). Sometimes these biases exist because an individual might be racist and sometimes they exist because of endemic or institutional types of racism. I am also glad that everyone tells us that the most fouled players include Zaha and Toney and therefore statistically I must be wrong. Someone also suggested I should engage my brain on this basis. Thankfully I did engage my brain before I wrote in in the first place and looking at most fouled players in the league is basically the most stupid way possible of using statistics. If you can accept that a more accurate way of representing who’s getting a disproportionate number of decisions would be touches per foul then the data shows…. Zaha still up there – a foul every 12 touches Maddison – 15 Grealish – 18 Pulisic – 18 Kane/Vardy/Bowen/Sterling – 25 Salah – 61 I totally get that lots of white people prefer to bury their heads in the sand and not think that anything is to do with skin colour. The claims of “There’s no racism issue in Britain” carries about as much weight as the people who claim there’s no paedophiles in the Angola (where the age of consent is 12 years old). Accepting there is a possibility of some kind of weird non-football reason why someone like Salah gets fewer decisions per touch doesn’t close off discussions about racism like one mailboxer suggested in the afternoon. If anything it is helpful because if the PGMOL or UEFA did try to understand what unconscious explanation existed for it then they could train officials to eliminate whatever it might be. Whilst I did imply it was a race issue I am really open to the possibility that it could be all sorts of other things resulting in this outcome. The question is – can anyone from the afternoon mailbox actually think through what I’ve said above and accept it just might be a race issue?Minty, LFC  …Lee’s mail was a great example of how badly statistics can get mangled in the wrong hands. First off, pointing to the fact that Salah has only one card for diving doesn’t mean he doesn’t regularly dive. You can do it while being really good at conning the referee, so that’s an oversimplistic conclusion. Anyone who watches Salah knows that, like most modern attackers, he does like to go down easy from time to time. ‘He is literally the harshest treated wide forward in all of Europe by referees. That not even hyperbole it’s just statistical fact’ he goes on to claim, pointing to numbers relating to how often he gets free-kicks. Nope, it’s hyperbole. To do a proper analysis, you’d need to consider some of the (countless) variables at play, such as, just for starters, how many times each player gets tackled per 90 mins. You might consider that, fabulous player that he is, Salah often finds himself with large amounts of space to run into and defenders can’t catch him. Liverpool are all about those quick turnovers and when it works, they are often in oodles of space. Conversely, with Grealish, it doesn’t matter if he’s ‘not on Salah’s level’. It matters more the type of player he is, especially as the seasons referred to in his data are presumably the three before this. Grealish was the go-to guy making runs from midfield for Villa, switching wings, taking it in tight areas, looking to draw fouls to alleviate pressure, and dare I say it, going down easy from time to time. It stands to reason that a player like that is fouled more. Perhaps Salah is that intelligent a player he moves it as quickly as possible and doesn’t take too many touches like Grealish tends to do. As for the thing regarding teams with English attackers getting more penalties, this looks a spurious correlation. Looks more like 4 of the Top 5 league places were in the Top 5, along with one outlier, in Brighton. This would be expected. Both City and Brighton were on 9, followed by Newcastle on 7. And then 5 teams (25% of the league) all stuck on 6. It almost sounds like the data is normally distributed, and there’s some chance variation going on, but you can’t come to many conclusions without doing lots of stretching. Of course we’d be able to assess this better if Lee actually linked to all the data he is talking about. If he does want to know more about how correlation is not causation, he should Google ‘spurious correlations’, and learn about the TERRIFYING link between high cheese consumption and people dying by getting tangled up in bedsheets.Pablo, MUFC, Dublin, getting that stats party started…. Football’s greatest mystery How can a team spend a billion to become this bad? Opposition players must be p*ssing themselves laughing how easy it is to play against United!Manyooligan (Do Telles and Rashford even realize the problem is on their flank???) SoC  …You know on closer inspection that Ronaldo lad is really good at football. He’s probably not the problem at Man United.Robbie DFC  …Imagine thinking Ronaldo was the issue. With a team like Liverpool or City, he would have scored over 50 goals this season across all competitions. Single handedly carrying a below par United across the finishing line. This season should be counted as one of his finest, seeing what kind of a team he is playing for and how much impact he single handedly has had on the season. I can count atleast 10-12 separate occasions where he has won us some points and carried us in a game. On the other hand you got 100m Lukaku, 71m Havertz & 50m Werner who all combined still do not possess half the skill Ronaldo does, or else it would have been 5-1.Aman (Great ball by Matic though, twice in two weeks now)   ",positive,arsenal,2

Wilfried Zaha gets praise but Norwich, Watford and Jesse Marsch do not. Winners Everton Any Everton supporter with a proclivity for ritualisation might find these last few weeks of the season particularly taxing. It is basic human nature to superstitiously recreate certain behaviours and practices – wearing a supposedly ‘lucky’ item of clothing or following a specific morning routine – in the hope of capturing that same positive energy. Fans might not be able to control what the players do, but if setting off early morning fireworks outside the opposition hotel, carrying an incredibly tranquil dog aloft through a raucous crowd, noisily welcoming the team bus, playing a game of catch with Richarlison and a flare and hiding the match ball up your jumper during stoppage time preceded a crucial victory over the reigning world and European champions, it might be worth trying again for the last five fixtures. Everton will be petrified of changing anything, considering how long it has taken to stumble upon a formula that works. After three wins and a draw in their opening four games, the longest unbeaten run the Toffees have been on in the Premier League this season is two matches. That surely has to change at some point before the end of the campaign for them to survive. But after watching that gap to safety extend to five points before kick-off on Sunday, Everton finally produced under pressure against Chelsea. It was a dogged, determined performance typified by Jordan Pickford’s brilliance, Yerry Mina’s snide and the industry of Demarai Gray and Richarlison, who combined for the winner. The only negative is that Frank Lampard’s side have two fixtures remaining at Goodison Park in comparison to three more trips away. Stock up on sparklers, prepare the calm canines and wear the baggiest clothes possible for that four-day period in which Brentford and Crystal Palace visit Merseyside, because Everton are 10th in a home table – and bottom, at least three points behind every other team in an away one – for a reason. Everton substance over style earns Lampard huge Chelsea scalp in relegation dogfight  BurnleyWhile there were 5,787 days between the amassing of Michael Jackson’s seven UK number ones, the accrual of ten Premier League points has taken Mike Jackson barely a fortnight. Burnley have won three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since April 2019. That same sequence of results – 2-0 against Wolves, 1-3 at Bournemouth and 2-0 against Cardiff – just so happens to contain the previous instance of the Clarets coming from behind to win away in the league. An Ashley Barnes own goal gifted Eddie Howe’s Cherries a fourth-minute lead but the striker rounded off the scoring early in the second half to complete a fine recovery. Three years later, James Tarkowski handed Watford the advantage after eight minutes by accidentally rebounding a shot into his own net. Barnes was central to their revival again, an inspired substitute for Wout Weghorst with half an hour remaining. It changed the angle and method of attack and Watford could not sustain the pressure. This unorthodox caretaker reign has reignited a fading survival bid but also reinvigorated a squad which looked quietly fractured and bereft. The Clarets have scored six goals in four games since Sean Dyche’s departure, each from different players in Wout Weghorst, Connor Roberts, Nathan Collins, Matej Vydra and now the unlikeliest double act of Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill. That the result effectively relegated Watford, barring a miracle, could have a further uplifting effect on one of the most tightly-knit squads around; seeing the pain of the drop first-hand sharpens the collective focus to avoid it. Burnley are finally on course to do just that. Michael Jackson has only been in charge of Burnley since 15 April and already has more Premier League points (10) than any Watford manager has taken this season (Munoz 7, Ranieri 6, Hodgson 9). — Richard Jolly 🇺🇦 (@RichJolly) May 1, 2022   Wilfried Zaha and Patrick VieiraThe situation could hardly have been managed any better. Patrick Vieira noted that Leeds wanted to have their cake and eat it, targeting Wilfried Zaha and fouling him four times before Kalvin Phillips tarred the Crystal Palace forward with a familiar brush.“For someone who dives so much, he has an awful lot of bruises on his ankles,” his manager said, explaining why Zaha started on the bench against Southampton. There was a time when that would have been an automatic signal of defeat for Palace. Zaha was their talisman, without whom they had little hope of operating functionally. He remains integral but this is a solid side that is adorned by his brilliance, rather than solely reliant upon it. Four minutes after Eberechi Eze’s equaliser against Southampton, Vieira threw Zaha on for the final half an hour with the express intention of occupying the home defence as a centre-forward – “We put him in the No.9 because of his mobility and the fact he can hold the ball and run in-behind” – and the results were resounding. Southampton are Zaha’s most frequent opponent. He has faced them 20 times. But his last few visits to St Mary’s had ranged from forgettable to a frustrating exhibition of his main weakness. The 29-year-old constantly toes the line and while he crossed the wrong side in rising to the provocation of James Ward-Prowse and being sent off in February 2019, Zaha somehow resisted the temptation to celebrate in the Southampton midfielder’s face upon his sublime stoppage-time winner. This is already the highest-scoring season of his career and it is no coincidence that he no longer feels the burden of constantly having to drag Palace up to his level. Vieira has built a team worthy of their crown jewel.  Jurgen KloppFive changes from midweek delivered a fifth 1-0 win of the Premier League season for Liverpool. The nature of those victories sum up Jurgen Klopp’s impeccable squad management, with each delivered by a different scorer: Naby Keita against Newcastle; Sadio Mane against West Ham in March; Fabinho against Burnley in February; Mo Salah against Aston Villa in December; and Divock Origi against Wolves the prior week. Extend it to all competitions and a sixth 1-0 win came from Diogo Jota’s effort against Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup quarter-finals. It is an enduring testament to both their strength in depth and of character.  RodriOne of the key fulcrums behind Manchester City’s unexpected set-piece dominance has been Rodri. They look far tighter defending free-kicks and corners with the midfielder in place, and much more threatening attacking them with him lurking. Perhaps behind only Ederson, it feels like Rodri is the player Pep Guardiola staked his reputation on the most. For a holding midfielder, his defensive instincts were initially poor and that counter-pressing role often proved beyond his capabilities and speed. There were few more polarising Manchester City players at one point: some saw enough to suggest he could eventually provide the necessary foundation for success, while others feared that dominance of the English game might always be just out of Rodri’s reach. He epitomises Guardiola’s reign in that way, by rising above preconceptions and changing the game to his whim instead of the other way around. His teammates have stood out at certain points, but Rodri has been a model of consistency.  Brighton’s scoutsMarc Cucurella was outstanding. Yves Bissouma was excellent. Moises Caicedo looks like an absolute Premier League natural. Enock Mwepu’s versatility has been a welcome addition to his game. Leandro Trossard has that air of a player who could raise his levels to suit the standard of most teams. Robert Sanchez matched his tally of clean sheets from last season. Those six players were signed for combined fees equivalent to the sales of Benjamin White, Anthony Knockaert and Aaron Mooy over the last two years. It is a neat party trick to master, particularly as it does not rely upon a specific manager, although the influence of an excellent coach undeniably helps the process. “We sold Ben and we’ve managed to improve. That’s the challenge in the Premier League for teams like us.It’s impossible to think you can keep hold of everybody. But we can sell at the right time, at the right price, then carry on trying to improve,” was Graham Potter’s message after the win over Wolves. Acknowledging that role in football’s food chain is important; embracing it is crucial. Marc Cucurella is unbelievably good every time I watch Brighton. So technically proficient on the ball, rounded defensive game, and can run the whole flank for the full 90 — Aaron Moniz (@amonizfootball) April 30, 2022   Cristian RomeroPatson Daka was theamuse-bouche that only intensified Cristian Romero’s appetite for his main course of Turkish affright. The halfway second challenge that directly preceded Heung-min Son’s first goal did not resemble a halfway line clash between hardened centre-halves, only because Caglar Soyuncu was entirely consumed by his counterpart. It was a comprehensive clattering. Tottenham would rise to fourth only temporarily, but even if they do eventually miss out on the Champions League there is solace in Romero’s presence. “The difficulty is, what top players are going to go to Spurs?” Roy Keane asked in January, suggesting that qualification for Europe’s premier competition was a prerequisite for attracting the best talent. Romero disproves that  Mikel ArtetaArsenal are another step closer to the ultimate justification. By the close of the January transfer window, Rob Holding had started four Premier League games and Mo Elneny just one. Eddie Nketiah’s only appearances outside of the League Cup by then had lasted no more than 19 minutes off the bench. Yet Mikel Arteta trusted all three to deliver when the inescapable time came that he had to call upon them. The Spaniard will be mocked and criticised by many onlookers but harnessing that sort of squad harmony is a delicate balancing act that only the two coaches competing for the title have managed better. The excellence of youth has underpinned this Arsenal season – Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli assisting the goals was apropos – but this is far more of a team effort than it ever has been a case of individualism.   Losers NorwichThere are deeper reads to be had on Norwich’s demise, but describing it as inevitable is misleading. In this particular season they had every chance of avoiding relegation, armed with a solid budget and the painful lessons of previous failures, with hindsight showing that other clubs could have been pulled further into danger. They should have had every advantage on Brentford, for example, yet 19 points separate the reigning second-tier champions from last season’s play-off winners. The sale of Emiliano Buendia was both predictable and early, yet the Canaries used neither the windfall nor the time nearly well enough. Most importantly, there was once an understanding and acceptance from the supporters, who long put their faith in the project and were sold The Norwich Way as the only way. That self-funded model has felt like a pre-prepared excuse all season. Other clubs have navigated those financial constraints much more convincingly. And unless the culture indelibly changes, even promotion next campaign will come with an undercurrent of trepidation from three successive top-flight relegations. Stuart Webber and his time have a few mountains to climb, not least in terms of getting supporters back onside.  Watford The feeling at Vicarage Road will be similar, albeit their fate has not been officially confirmed and the route by which it will surely be reached is vastly different. There have at least been suggestions that Watford intend on changing their ways by arming a younger manager with time and patience instead of whittling down the never-ending list of names on the combined Pozzo-Duxbury contacts book. But the jury will not expect to reconvene on that anytime soon. The next challenge will be to retain certain portions of the squad, because for all their flaws this is not a team which should be setting records for consecutive top-flight home defeats. Ismaila Sarr, Joao Pedro and Emmanuel Dennis are among those who have been gradually dragged down by an atrocious defence, despite the opposite being true last season when Xisco Munoz built upon a solid backline to gain promotion. There should be more optimism at Watford than Norwich, even if the Roy Hodgson appointment has been an unmitigated disaster for all involved. But Duxbury in particular will have questions to answer, considering he spent last May painstakingly listing all the mistakes the Hornets had learned from ahead of this season. Same again. Imagine being a #WatfordFC sub today and your manager not believing in you enough to bring you on. I hope for Duxbury’s sake the club aren’t relying on any of those subs for next year. — Rob Ezekiel (@Rob_Ezekiel) April 30, 2022   Jesse MarschIt was notable that Frank Lampard and Jesse Marsch echoed similar lines. The former described Everton’s fans as “the 12th man” and thanked them for helping “get us over the line late in the game”. The latter said that “the best part was the fans’ response” and “there was so much passion and love for the team from the fans”. The Leeds manager did stress that “that isn’t pandering to our fans” but it is a tough balance to strike. He and Lampard have both perhaps visited that well a little too often. But the key difference there is that Everton fans – rightly or wrong – welcomed their boss as the replacement for an unpopular figurehead, while Marsch started at a natural disadvantage due to the nature of Marcelo Bielsa’s relationship with the support. Few could blame him for leaning on that aspect of a 4-0 defeat in which Leeds had their chances. And in truth, they are losers mainly because of the worst possible results elsewhere. That five-game unbeaten run immediately before the Manchester City loss is keeping heads barely above water and a run-in of Arsenal, Chelsea, Brighton and Brentford has its pros and cons. Pandering or otherwise, Marsch and his players will need the fans to be in full voice.  ChelseaJose Mourinho, in combination with Steven Gerrard, successfully tricked the world into forgetting Chelsea led the Premier League table as late as April 2014; it was not only Liverpool who capitulated in that title race. On a far lesser scale, Thomas Tuchel might be accompanying his players on a slow slide down this table. The German ought to be thankful that the league season is both over soon, and will require Arsenal to face Tottenham in its penultimate week. Chelsea sit three points ahead of Arsenal and five above Spurs, all having played the same number of games. But only two of those sides have momentum currently in their favour. The Blues are finding it difficult to generate that and after a run of five consecutive Premier League wins, their form has been: L, W, L, W, D, L. Tuchel increasingly looks incapable of rousing them from this slump and preventing the individual mistakes that continue to undermine any hint of progress. The season could yet end with Wembley glory and Tuchel’s strength at Stamford Bridge thus far has been in managing those one-off games. But his reign will ultimately be measured by Premier League progress and that is a nut he still seems unable to crack.  WolvesThat unavoidable sense of flux has returned. Bruno Lage has completed a hat-trick of three successive Premier League defeats. Wolves emerged from that stuttering August start to establish their Champions League credentials, which were firmly ended by losses to Arsenal, West Ham and Crystal Palace in March. That cushion to 9th and below should be substantial enough to prevent goalless setbacks against Newcastle, Burnley and Brighton doing lasting damage, but it is demoralising for a season that promised so much to deliver so little.  The European semi-finalistsConsidering how delicately those Europa League and Europa Conference League semi-finals are poised, West Ham and Leicester’s respective seasons hang in the balance. Both are without a win in their last four Premier League games, starting from the match after their quarter-final second-leg heroics and bleeding into the final matches of their semi-finals. If either progress then that drop-off will be forgotten but it will be difficult to gather anything tangible from the season if they are knocked out in midweek.  SouthamptonA ludicrous football club. Between December 15 and February 25, Southampton went on a run of one defeat in 10 Premier League games. From March 5 to April 30, that has become a sequence of one win in nine. ",positive,arsenal,6

The summer signings of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho were meant to catapult the Red Devils nearer to the Premier League title but they have gone backwards instead. Man Utd are currently sixth in the Premier League table after a 1-1 draw at home against Chelsea last night with the club needing a minor miracle now to finish ahead of fourth-placed Arsenal before the end of the season.

Rangnick mentioned there could be as many as ten new signings in the summer but a report in ESPN recently claimed that it was likely to be more like three. When asked if just United’s midfield needed rebuilding, Keane replied on Sky Sports: “Everything. Don’t get me started on the midfield. I think defensively. I’m still not happy with the goalkeeper. A couple of players up front. Huge!” Keane added: “Fernandes doesn’t get the ball back for you. Nobody mentions will he miss out. [Marcus] Rashford doesn’t do nowhere near enough. Sometimes they go to close people down but they are not really going after people, they’re just going through the motions. “We saw that again tonight with the amount of chances Chelsea created because players were going through the motions.

This is, for me, normal. “I think the whole group get on reasonably with each other, I’m not daring to say get on well, but I don’t see there is an issue with the atmosphere in the locker room. “They are very disappointed and frustrated. Had we converted the penalty it would have changed the whole game, but we didn’t. “We hit the post and had another VAR decision, we thought Cristiano’s goal was not offside. There were three unlucky VAR decision against us, there was also a handball decision inside the box. “But again we have to deal with it and cope with it.

We have conceded an average of three goals in our last three games, we were far better a few weeks ago. “There is a lot of work for sure. We knew that before the game.

Trailing 2-0 from a one-sided first leg, the former Arsenal boss was reminded their opponents had lost just three of 57 matches in a quadruple-chasing season. MAILBOX: Liverpool fans are the luckiest in the world, bad for city if Everton go down “I didn’t want to hear those details but I did,” he said. “It is a difficult task but we are working on the game. “We need to play a perfect game.

https://www.football365.com/news/tottenham-told-target-world-class-ex-arsenal-man-bayern-munich-gnabry,Tottenham told to target ‘world-class’ ex-Arsenal man – ‘that level of player is what you want’,"Ex-Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Paul Robinson has urged his former club to sign Bayern Munich and Germany star Serge Gnabry. The 26-year-old signed for Arsenal in 2011 when he was 16-years-old. He was unable to establish himself as a regular for the Gunners. Gnabry only played for them 18 times and he had an unsuccessful loan spell at West Brom during the 2015/16 season. Spurs settle another set of jitters with a masterclass from Son Heung-min The attacker left Arsenal in 2016 to join Werder Bremen on a permanent basis.Following an impressive debut season, Bayern Munich activated his release clause to sign him. The Germany international has been a key player for Bayern Munich in recent seasons. He has grabbed 63 goals and 40 assists from his 169 outings across all competitions. So far this term, he has been involved in 26 goals from his 43 appearances. His future at Bayern is in doubt as his contract expires in 2023. It was reported last week that Gnabry has rejected Bayern’s latest contract offer. If he signed the deal, his salary would have doubled. Robinson thinks Tottenham should be “in the hunt” to sign Gnabry this summer: “Gnabry is a world-class player,” Robinson told Football Insider. “If he is to leave Bayern Munich you would like to think that Spurs are in the hunt for him. “It is going to be a big summer for Spurs. A lot will depend on whether Harry Kane stays at the club, which I hope he does. “I’d question whether Gnabry would get into the Tottenham team ahead of Son, Kane and Kulusevski right now. He’d be competition for Kulusevski but I don’t think that position is a priority at the moment. “That level of player is what you want Spurs to be signing though.” Elsewhere, ex-France international Jerome Rothen has warned PSG against pursuing Antonio Conte because he’s “more passionate about his chequebook” than Spurs. Reports emerged last week linking Conte with a move to PSG with the French club apparently set to move on Mauricio Pochettino at the end of the season. Conte has a reputation for short stints in jobs, while there have been rumours that the Spurs boss wants a £30m wage package to take over at the French giants and former PSG winger Rothen thinks he’s the wrong man for the job. “Of course not. When you hear these demands, stay where you are. Certainly don’t come to a club like PSG, who need to improve their image, one far more healthy. “You need people who are passionate about football, and I’m not saying Conte isn’t, but he seems more passionate about his chequebook than managing Tottenham, PSG or another team.

After beating Chelsea and Manchester United, Arsenal travelled to face West Ham United on Sunday afternoon. Holding was handed a rare start and he headed the Gunners in front in the 38th minute. The score was 1-1 at the interval though as Jarrod Bowen scored. Everton top PL winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature Arsenal ran out winners in the end as Gabriel’s goal in the 55th minute earned them all three points. Tottenham defeated Leicester earlier in the day so Arteta’s side remain two points clear of their rivals. The battle for fourth is now just between the North London rivals. They face off at The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium next week. Holding has suggested that Arsenal “looked more like a team” after being told off by Arteta: “Yeah, we were a bit disappointed to concede that coming in just before half-time,” Holding told Arsenal Media. “It would have been nice to go in one-nil, but he gave us all a shouting and telling off and we came out and looked more like a team and played how he wanted to play.” On fans calling for him to be brought on off the bench in previous weeks, he added:“Yeah, the fans were calling to bring Rob Holding on, but he was already on! “It’s what it’s been like, Ben and Gabi have been great all year and when I’ve had to come on and try and help us secure the three points it’s vital for us, so to play the full 90 and get the three points is even better.” Elsewhere, Chris Sutton has criticised Arsenal for “celebrating like they’ve won the league” after their 2-1 victory over West Ham on Sunday.

He said: “I encourage them to celebrate every victory. Because you can tell how difficult it is in this game to win football matches. “Our supporters are the same, every time we win we should celebrate because when you lose or draw you know the faces are always (sad).” After the match against West Ham, Arteta insisted that he was relieved to win “ugly” as they won their third Premier League match on the bounce. “In England you say ‘win ugly’ and from my point of view we won ugly,” Arteta said. “It was a massive win in very difficult circumstances because we caused ourselves problems, especially with our decision-making. “But the team showed huge character, not giving up but to continue doing the right things. The way they fought and the way they understood how they had to manage the game in certain moments, it was phenomenal. “I am extremely happy to see a team that has this capacity to find a way to win and to show the character they showed.” On the pressure of staying above Tottenham, Arteta added: “When you have to pass the ball from A to B under pressure or no pressure, this is an excuse. “We were just sloppy at times and not precise and that led to a game we didn’t want to play in many moments. “We recognise that and sometimes it happens. To play here against this team is not easy at all and we found a way to win the match.”  ",positive,arsenal,5

United host Brentford on Monday night. Owen has called for Rangnick to give the club’s youngsters some game time against the Bees: “Now United have little to play for, I’m curious whether Ralf Rangnick will change the personnel,” (quotes via The Express). “There’s a lot of promising youngsters at the club, now would be an ideal opportunity for them to get some game time ahead of the new boss coming in this summer. “Brentford have had such a great season and can travel to Old Trafford full of confidence after that draw against Spurs. They’ve been very organised in recent weeks, and make it difficult for each side they face. “I’m still going to pick United. Brentford will be difficult to break down, I’m going for 1-0.” Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson has also made a prediction for Monday night’s clash at Old Trafford. The former Arsenal man thinks Man Utd and Brentford will draw 2-2. He believes this will be a “hard game” for the hosts: “Manchester United have more immediate concerns, however, and this’ll be a hard game for them,” Merson told Sportskeeda. “The way Brentford have been playing, they could pull this off. Who would’ve thought this was possible one, two, or ten years ago? “Brentford are going to go out there expecting to win this game.

The Gunners sit fourth in the table with four games to go. Their form dipped at the start of April as they were beaten by Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton. They have responded in recent weeks though, with them picking up victories over Chelsea, Man Utd and West Ham. Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature Fifth-placed Tottenham are chasing them down. Antonio Conte’s side returned to winning ways on Sunday as they got the better of Leicester City. The rivals meet in a vital North London derby at The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium next week. O’Hara has made an early prediction for the derby. He thinks “you have to back Spurs” to win given that they are at home: “Arsenal will slip up. I think they’ve got tough games,” O’Hara told talkSPORT. “I think [Tottenham] have got one more tough game, and then it’s the North London Derby. That’s like a cup final which could go either way. “I just have to back Spurs, surely you have to back Spurs under the lights, at home, against Arsenal.” Ray Parlour then chimed in: “It’s quite funny you saying Arsenal will crumble, Spurs do it every year!” Meanwhile,Jamie Redknapp has praised Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta for his decision to give the captain’s armband to Martin Odegaard in recent weeks. “Xhaka was captain for a while, didn’t really work, [then] Aubameyang, then they give it to Lacazette. It was almost that no one wanted to be. “But giving it to Odegaard, it feels right for me. He may not be the most vocal but when you watch him play, he organises people, he plays the right pass. He’s a lovely player to watch. “You can see from Mikel Arteta’s point of view, he’s almost his manager on the pitch.

https://www.football365.com/news/neville-destroys-man-utd-players-farce-liverpool-city-comparison,"‘Farce’ – Neville destroys Man Utd players with Liverpool, City comparison","Gary Neville has accused Man Utd players of having “over-inflated egos” and reckons none of them would get into the current Liverpool or Man City sides. The Red Devils suffered another blow to their chances of qualifying for the Champions League next season after they lost 1-0 to out-of-form Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday. Defeat against the Toffees means Man Utd are now six points behind fourth-placed Tottenham in the Premier League table with seven matches to go. ‘Laughable’ Liverpool exposed; Man Utd must shift quartet out To make matters worse, their last seven games of the season look extremely tricky to navigate, with Liverpool, Arsenal, Brighton and Crystal Palace to play away and Norwich, Brentford and Chelsea to face at Old Trafford. After watching Man City and Liverpool put on an amazing spectacle on Sunday, Neville tore into Man Utd after the weekend’s results. “I’ve got very few words left for Manchester United,” Neville said on his Sky Sports podcast. “No anger, no comment anymore. They are a bit of a farce; you almost expect it from them. The players are taking Ralf Rangnick down with them. They are bad. “When I look at Manchester City and Liverpool, they have humble football players; no over-inflated egos, they understand their position, the team comes first. “There isn’t one Manchester United player that would get into any of those two teams, so why would you have an over-inflated ego, think you didn’t have to work hard, or be spiritless? I don’t see anything anymore.” And Neville now thinks Rangnick’s reputation is now taking a hit with the Man Utd interim boss looking ‘weaker and vulnerable on the touchline’ in recent weeks. Neville added: “Ralf Rangnick came with an incredible reputation but he’s now starting to be wounded by what’s happening around him and he looks weaker and vulnerable on the touchline due to the performances of players on the pitch, who have nothing to do with him. “Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is a good man, the players liked him and yet they turned him over. It’s a real difficult position for the club to be at. “I feel like most Manchester United fans at this moment in time in that I don’t know where to turn next or what’s going to happen. “I’m living on the feeling that the club one day will return. The club will rise again but this is getting low, real low. But it will come back, and you look forward to that day. “Those Liverpool fans over my shoulder have been where Manchester United have been, they have been in those low moments when Manchester United were winning, when they maybe didn’t have a team they could be proud of. Maybe it’s time for those Manchester United players to have a look at themselves. “I do believe players want to do well, but what they are showing at this moment in time is nowhere near good enough.”  ",positive,arsenal,1
https://www.football365.com/news/arsenal-star-sake-names-toughest-opponent-embarrassed,‘He embarrassed me’ – Arsenal star Saka names toughest opponent,"Arsenal star Bukayo Saka has named Barcelona’s Sergio Busquets as his toughest opponent, recalling an occasion when the midfielder “embarrassed” him. Saka has made 122 appearances in all competitions since making his senior debut for Arsenal in 2018. READ MORE: Premier League winners and losers after City v Liverpool When asked who his toughest opponent was in an interview with GQ, Saka named Barcelona midfield general Busquets. The Spain international has won eight La Liga titles and three Champions League trophies in his time with the Catalan giants. Saka has come up against Busquets just once, in a pre-season friendly in August 2019. Saka said: “The way he just so elegantly turned me! I came at him to press him, I tried to fake this side then go to the other, and the way he just embarrassed me: I was just like, yeah, this guy is elite. “The way he just took me out of the play, I said, ‘Respect.’ [Busquets] is three steps ahead of everyone and that’s what makes you a top footballer. That’s what I realised that day.” Saka has played in a number of positions for the Gunners, including wing-back and central midfield. But he now operates on the left wing and is a key part of Gareth Southgate’s England squad. The 20-year-old grew up idolising Barcelona legend Lionel Messi and recalled one of the Argentinian’s famous Copa del Rey goal against Athletic Club as the one he would most like to have scored himself. Saka added: “Because of the moment,” said Saka. “I think I would say Leo Messi’s goal in the Copa del Rey final against Athletic Club. The one where he dribbled everyone. Now that I play, I can see how hard it is to score that goal. “People are trying to kick him, to bring him down in the process, and he just keepsgoing, and he still scored in the final, as well. I was just like, wow. When he says he’s going past you, you’re not stopping him!” ",positive,arsenal,2

Fernandes opened the scoring for the Red Devils as they beat Brentford 3-0 in their final home game of the campaign. United are expected to fall short of booking a place in the Champions League this season, as they sit five points behind fourth-place Arsenal with just two games left to play - the Gunners and fellow challengers Tottenham have two games in hand. The midfielder now has 10 Premier League goals to his name for the season, but says he would rather lift silverware with the club than boost his statistics.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/johan-bakayoko-psv-teenage-star-thriving-van-nistelrooy/blt79419761189d2222,Johan Bakayoko: PSV's teenage star thriving under Van Nistelrooy,"One of the finest strikers of the 2000s, Ruud van Nistelrooy has had to wait for his chance to step into first-team management. The ex-Manchester United and Real Madrid forward has had two spells as part of the coaching staff for the Netherlands national side, while also working within the youth structure at PSV. But this summer, Van Nistelrooy will make the step up to take charge of the senior side in Eindhoven, replacing the outgoing Roger Schmidt after a season in charge of Jong PSV in the second tier of Dutch football. Given his playing career, the 45-year-old will be expected to particularly oversee improvements in attack, though there is a chance he will first have to rebuild his forward line. Cody Gakpo is expected to move on, with a host of Europe's biggest clubs - including Arsenal, Liverpool and Bayern Munich - having been linked with the 22-year-old winger. At the start of the season, the same thing was expected for Noni Madueke, but injuries have hampered the England youth international in 2021-22, meaning the Premier League and Bundesliga clubs that are keen on the forward may well decide to look elsewhere, at least for now. Regardless, Van Nistelrooy is going to require reinforcements, one of which could be the teenager that has lit up his own side this term. With just a single game of Jong PSV's season to play, Johan Bakayoko can already boast a record of 17 goals and 11 assists for the team in 2021-22, meaning he has been directly involved in a goal every 85.4 minutes in the second division. Madueke, is that you? 🧐De 18-jarige Johan Bakayoko steelt de show bij Jong PSV tegen Almere City: twee assists en een goal ✨#JPSALM pic.twitter.com/G5Cj5p0psn Given he only managed a solitary strike and three assists in 19 appearances at that level last season, that is quite some improvement from the Belgium youth international, and one which Van Nistelrooy has played a key role in. ""You can see that he has power and also a good shot,"" Van Nistelrooy told ESPN in January. ""He plays such controlled football that you forget that he is only 18. ""If he continues to invest so much in what he does, he is a boy who is on the right track to join the first team at the end of the season."" Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: That step has not quite materialised, however, with the 19-year-old having made just two appearances off the bench for PSV's senior side thus far, but that is likely to change once Van Nistelrooy takes the reins. PSV certainly envisaged him becoming a first-team player when they tempted him to join the club from Anderlecht in 2019, with Bakayoko having previously spent time at Club Brugge and Mechelen. His first two seasons with the club, though, suggested that he may be some distance off that level, and that following Madueke's path of starring for the youth sides before making an impact on the Eredivisie was unlikely. The club, though, saw things differently, and in the summer of 2021 offered the teenager a new four-year contract, which Bakayoko signed while donned in a white suit and red bowtie. ""Now it's up to me to prove that I can put up the numbers required of me,"" he said at the time. ""I want to be more decisive in terms of my stats, and I've been talking to the coaches about doing that."" He has been a man of his word, honing his finishing ability under Van Nistelrooy's watchful eye, though he is much more than a player who puts the ball in the net. Naturally left-footed, he generally plays from the right-hand side, using his speed and close control to cause nightmares for opposing full-backs before cutting inside to either score or create chances for his team-mates. With six, he has the most goals from outside the penalty area in the Dutch second tier, with his decision making in terms of when to try his luck and when to look for help much improved from previous years. ""At the beginning of 2021, Johan was not doing well,"" his agent, Gerard Witters, told Het Nieuwsblad. ""But after he got his new contract, everything changed. ""He started to boost his stats and his recent games were phenomenal. The club has told me that Johan is already better than they initially thought he would be. ""Before he sometimes played like a crazy dog. He had great qualities and was very explosive, but he produced poor crosses and took shots when they were not the best option. ""Now he knows a lot more what he's going to do and defenders can't stop him anymore, despite the fact that he always does the same movement (cutting inside).” Bakayoko's form has been particularly good since the season's winter break, with his confidence spiking after he netted four times against VVV-Venlo in January. More recently, he came off the bench for the final 33 minutes against FC Eindhoven and scored twice before assisting PSV's third goal in a game that looked to be heading for a draw until the youngster's introduction. Now the challenge becomes replicating those performances against the best teams in the land, with PSV hopeful of yet again challenging Ajax for the title after their back-and-forth race this season. His history with Van Nistelrooy should certainly help in that respect, and if the legendary striker is to succeed as a coach, then he will hope that he can soon rely on his young charge to lead the way.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/ghana-midfielder-partey-hints-at-return-to-arsenal-from/bltcc3d85aae443a57f,Ghana midfielder Partey hints at return to Arsenal from injury ‘soon’,"Ghana international Thomas Partey has hinted he could make a return to the Arsenal squad before the end of the season. The 28-year-old Black Star picked up an injury during Arsenal’s 3-0 defeat against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park Stadium on April 4 and he has gone ahead to miss five Premier League matches.  He missed the 2-1 defeat against Brighton & Hove Albion at the Emirates Stadium, the 1-0 away defeat against Southampton, the 4-2 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, the 3-1 victory against Manchester United at home, and the 2-1 away win against West Ham United.  In his absence, Arsenal have relied on Egypt international Mohamed Elneny, who has started in the last three matches where the Gunners have registered wins. While Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has ruled out the player for the rest of the season, it seems Partey is not giving up yet.  On Monday, Arsenal’s official Twitter handle posted a video of defender Gabriel Magalhaes diving to head home a cross from Gabriel Martinelli for the winning goal against West Ham at London Stadium and Partey responded. 🇧🇷 Gabi x Gabi 🇧🇷#WHUARS pic.twitter.com/pq690RT5Cn “Tom X Tom [Takehiro Tomiyasu] soon.”  His statement was also in response to defender Takehiro Tomiyasu, who returned from injury in the game against West Ham, and an indication he will play with him before the season ends.  Ahead of Arsenal’s trip to face West Ham, Arteta admitted the absence of Partey was affecting his plans for the team.  “The stats are there and they are unquestionable,” Arteta told Daily Mail. “The win rate when Thomas is there is higher. It is something that is not good for us because in the last two seasons he has not been there as much as we want.  “We need him to play in that role on his own, with the quality he brings and the experience that he brings. And the fact he brings things that are unique that we want.  “Then we can accommodate players in other positions that for them are more relevant and can determine games in the way that we can. “Otherwise we have to consider and improve with the players we have by using them in a different way, changing formation, and finding ways to compensate.”  Arsenal, who are sitting fourth on the 20-team table with 63 points from 34 matches, will face Leeds United at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.

The Three Lions reached the semi-finals in Russia four years ago, only to come up short against Croatia, and reached a final at Wembley Stadium in Euro 2020 before suffering more penalty shootout heartache against Italy. Positive steps are being taken in the right direction, but can a 56-year wait for tangible success be brought to a close in the Middle East and who will be charged with the task of landing major silverware? GOAL takes a look at the hopefuls longing to see their names called. Jordan Pickford.That's all. pic.twitter.com/BKSqEuwXWg Everton keeper Jordan Pickford has been Southgate’s go-to option between the sticks, as he blends shot-stopping ability with impressive distribution off the deck, and appears guaranteed to make the cut if fit. The same could be said for Aaron Ramsdale following his eye-catching campaign at Arsenal, with the 23-year-old another of those that is as comfortable with his feet as he is with his hands. Burnley’s Nick Pope has often been third in line for England and will hope to see that trend continue when some big calls are made ahead of a showpiece event in November. Sam Johnstone is playing Championship football at West Brom this season, but remains in contention, while Jack Butland could surge up the pecking order if a starting berth is retained at Crystal Palace. Etienne Green has been making quite a name for himself at Saint-Etienne in France but he, along with fellow England U21 international Josef Bursik of Stoke, remains one for the future. Alex McCarthy and Fraser Forster have been in and around senior squads before, but would need untimely setbacks to be endured by others in order to see a path clear for them.

Harry Maguire of Manchester United, Manchester City centre-half John Stones, United and Chelsea left-backs Luke Shaw and Ben Chilwell and the versatile Ben White of Arsenal are all expected to get the nod. There is far greater competition at right-back, with Kyle Walker of Manchester City, Liverpool star Trent Alexander-Arnold, Chelsea full-back Reece James and Newcastle new boy Kieran Trippier all competing for one starting berth. Outside of the established elite, Tyrone Mings’ value as a left-footed centre-half could see the Aston Villa man called upon. Conor Coady of Wolves, AC Milan centre-half Fikayo Tomori and Eric Dier and Joe Gomez of Tottenham and Liverpool respectively could figure if fortune favours them. Tariq Lamptey has caught the eye at Brighton, but faces fierce competition in his favoured defensive berth. Recognition may well come for the likes of Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi or Chelsea's Trevoh Chalobah as they continue their development. Player Selection odds Harry Maguire 1/20 John Stones 1/20 Ben Chilwell 1/16 Luke Shaw 1/12 Kyle Walker 1/8 Ben White 1/3 Trent Alexander-Arnold 1/3 Reece James 4/11 Kieran Trippier 7/4 Tyrone Mings 2/1 Conor Coady 2/1 Fikayo Tomori 3/1 Eric Dier 7/2 Joe Gomez 7/2 Marc Guehi 7/2 Trevoh Chalobah 7/2 Tariq Lamptey 4/1 Well… About time 😅 an absolute dream to score my first England goal 🦁 well done boys! Great performance! ❤️ pic.twitter.com/Ea10Hb4P9H There are another eight apparently obvious selections when it comes to midfield berths, with West Ham holding star Declan Rice, talented teenager Jude Bellingham of Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea playmaker Mason Mount and Manchester City youngster Phil Foden the shortest-priced of those. Jack Grealish, as the most expensive player in British football at Manchester City, is another almost guaranteed to secure a ticket, along with Bukayo Saka of Arsenal and Leeds United talisman Kalvin Phillips. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson will hope to have done enough to earn a call from Southgate, while Arsenal starlet Emile Smith Rowe has emerged as another useful creative influence. Conor Gallagher’s impressive loan spell at Crystal Palace has brought him into contention, while Jesse Lingard cannot be ruled out entirely despite struggling for minutes at Manchester United as he will drop into the free agent pool this summer and land himself a move elsewhere. James Maddison may be a key man at Leicester, but other playmakers are ahead of him on England’s depth chart, while the same can be said for Liverpool midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain – a man with 35 caps to his name. Dele Alli will need to produce something special during a loan spell at relegation-threatened Everton to work his way back into favour, while home-grown Chelsea star Ruben Loftus-Cheek is another to have fallen out of favour since figuring in England’s run to the last four at the 2018 World Cup. Player Selection odds Declan Rice 1/20 Jude Bellingham 1/20 Mason Mount 1/20 Phil Foden 1/20 Jack Grealish 1/16 Bukayo Saka 1/10 Jordan Henderson 1/3 Kalvin Phillips 1/3 Emile Smith Rowe Evens Conor Gallagher 7/4 James Ward-Prowse 11/4 Jesse Lingard 11/4 Curtis Jones 4/1 Harvey Barnes 4/1 Harvey Elliott 4/1 James Maddison 4/1 Oliver Skipp 4/1 Ruben Loftus-Cheek 5/1 Dele Alli 6/1 Jacob Ramsey 6/1 Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 10/1 ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️Harry Kane is now @England's joint-highest goalscorer in major tournaments (EUROs, #WorldCup), alongside @GaryLineker on 10 goals pic.twitter.com/8uyw6EBXbY Given that he is captain of the Three Lions and a man well on course to chase down Wayne Rooney’s all-time record goal haul for his country, it may come as a surprise to find that Tottenham striker Harry Kane is not top of the market when it comes to attacking calls. He will be involved, though, if untimely injuries are avoided, as will Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling and Manchester United star Marcus Rashford. Jadon Sancho has come back into form at Manchester United, giving him a shot at selection, while Dominic Calvert-Lewin will be hoping to do enough at Everton to prove that he can provide capable cover for Kane. Manchester United's Marcus Rashford remains highly regarded and is expected to make the plane, but his odds of inclusion may take a tumble if the dip in form, which saw him left out of England's March international panel, continues. Jarrod Bowen’s fine form at West Ham has made him flavour of the month, but he will need to maintain his current standards in order to secure a ticket to Qatar. Tammy Abraham has fared admirably in Italy with Roma, while Ollie Watkins remains a handful at Aston Villa, and they could be asked to provide back-up in a No.9 post. Callum Hudson-Odoi needs to be figuring more frequently for Chelsea in order to put himself into contention, Patrick Bamford and Callum Wilson have to shake off injury struggles at Leeds and Newcastle respectively, and Danny Ings must raise his game with Aston Villa in order to add to his three caps. There is little chance of Leicester’s Jamie Vardy being asked to step out of international retirement, but an attacking star may burst onto the scene out of nowhere and stage a late surge for selection within Southgate’s goalscoring ranks.

In a match that was vital to the club's hopes of securing Champions League football for next season, Man Utd came undone as they fell 3-1 to Arsenal, another contender in the hunt for a top-four place. With the loss, Man Utd have lost three of their last four Premier League matches, with Scholes revealing that the atmosphere around the club has deteriorated. ""It's an absolute mess. It's a disaster of a dressing room,"" Scholes said on DAZN. ""I had a quick chat with Jesse the other day. I'm sure he won't mind me saying: that dressing room is a disaster."" It's been a difficult year at Old Trafford, with neither Ole Gunnar Solskhaer nor Ralf Rangnick able to steer the club in the right direction. As things stand, Man Utd sit sixth in the Premier League with there still being a possibility that the club misses out on European football altogether for next season. Man Utd are now six points behind Arsenal, who have a game in hand in fourth place, while Tottenham sit fifth, three points ahead of the Red Devils despite playing two fewer games.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/biennial-world-cup-stop-african-migrants-dying-in-the-sea/bltbafb5a24bd4fc383,"Biennial World Cup could help to stop African migrants dying in the sea, claims FIFA president Infantino","FIFA president Gianni Infantino has suggested that a biennial World Cup could stop African migrants from ""dying in the sea"" in a controversial speech at the Assembly of the Council of Europe. Infantino has been pushing his hotly-debated Future of Football project for many months now, with former Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger leading the initiative that has proposed the staging of a World Cup every two years rather than four. The plans have been widely rejected by European and political organisations, but Infantino remains undeterred and is now claiming that the change is crucial for the future of the game in African countries. Infantino has risked a backlash by suggesting that doubling the frequency of the World Cup could prevent African migrants from risking their lives to gain entry into Europe in search of ""opportunities"". The 51-year-old told the parliamentary assembly in Strasbourg: “This topic is not about whether we want a World Cupevery two years, but about what do we want to do for the future of football. “If we think about the rest of the world and the vast majority of Europe, then we have to think about what football brings. Football is about opportunity, about hope, about the national teams. We cannot say to the rest of the world 'give us your money, but watch us on TV'. We need to include them. “We need to find ways to include the whole world to give hope to Africans so that they don’t need to cross the Mediterranean in order to find maybe a better life but, more probably, death in the sea. “We need to give opportunities, to give dignity. Not by charity but by allowing the rest of the world to participate. Maybe the World Cup every two years is not the answer. We discuss it.” Following a backlash against his comments, Infantino later released a statement claiming that his words - which were recorded live and quoted at length by many media outlets - were taken out of context. He said: “Given that certain remarks made by me before the Council of Europe earlier today appear to have been misinterpreted and taken out of context, I wish to clarify that, in my speech, my more general message was that everyone in a decision-making position has a responsibility to help improve the situation of people around the world. ""If there are more opportunities available, including in Africa, but certainly not limited to that continent, this should allow people to take these opportunities in their own countries. ""This was a general comment, which was not directly related to the possibility of playing a FIFA World Cup every two years."" Infantino, Wenger and former FIFA president Sepp Blatter have all spoken passionately about the potential benefits of holding the World Cup on a more regular basis, but their plans have not been well received by the football community. The Football Supporters Europe [FSE] organisation has declared ""we do not want or need more World Cups"" while UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin has warned that European football's main governing body and CONMEBOL could boycott future tournaments. A number of active footballers have also spoken out to condemn the proposal, including Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. ""You hear that they want to put a European Championship and a World Cup every year,"" he told Sky Sports in October. ""When will we get a rest? Never.So, in the end, top players will get injured all the time and that's the end of it. ""It's something that should be much better and better-taken care of. We're not robots.""

https://www.goal.com/en/news/we-already-play-60-games-a-year-mbappe-speaks-out-against/bltb3d7047e54aabd98,'We already play 60 games a year' - Mbappe speaks out against World Cup every two years,"France star Kylian Mbappe has spoken out against FIFA’s plans to hold a World Cup every two years, suggesting it would make the tournament less special and put a greater physical strain on players. Football’s world governing body has suggested a biennial competition as part of a revamp of the current calendar. However, the proposal has met with significant opposition from those who question how it would fit in to an already-busy football schedule. Speaking at the Global Soccer Awards, where he was named Best Men’s Player of The Year, PSG striker Mbappe said: “World Cup, every two years? I can’t say if it’s right or wrong. “It’s something unique that happens every four years. Playing it every two years would become a normal competition. “We already play 60 games a year. We are happy to play, but when it’s too much it is too much. If you want to have quality you have to allow the players to rest.” Mbappe is the latest name to comment on what is becoming an increasingly divisive issue in football. Former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who is FIFA’s head of global development, has backed the idea. The Frenchman says the plans would mean fewer qualifying games and international breaks during the season and more high-stakes knockout matches, which he says is what the fans want. However, the plans have been met with some opposition, most notably from the European and South American governing bodies UEFA and CONMEBOL. Both bodies have publicly opposed FIFA's plans for more regular World Cups, with UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin expressing ""grave concerns"" about the proposals earlier this year. Earlier this month the two organisations revealed plans for South American teams to join the Nations League from 2024, which appears to directly conflict with FIFA’s plans.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/henry-angry-arsenal-treatment-saliba/blt5766f2620f5244f8,Henry angry with Arsenal treatment of Saliba: 'They didn't even let him make a mistake',"Thierry Henry has expressed his anger over Arsenal's treatment of William Saliba, insisting ""they didn't even let him make a mistake"". Arsenal signed Saliba from Saint Etienne for £27 million ($34m) in July 2019, and immediately sent him back to Stade Geoffroy-Guichard on loan. The Frenchman has since had two more loan spells away from Emirates Stadium, the latest of which saw him join Marseille for the duration of the 2021-22 campaign with the Gunners yet to hand him his competitive debut in English football. Henry has questioned Mikel Arteta's handling of Saliba, who he believes has proved his quality at Stade Velodrome over the past 10 months. ""They didn't even let him make a mistake,"" the Arsenal legend told Amazon Prime of his old club's treatment of Saliba. ""He left before an error. ""He didn't even have the chance to compete for his place. What he is doing here is extraordinary. He was rewarded with a selection for the France team. ""Now he belongs to Arsenal, I don't know where he will end up. We have seen that it was a little difficult for him to express himself on the subject. ""What I know is that he could have been in the Arsenal group. I am not Mikel Arteta, but I found it difficult for him.  Anyway, he responded well and that's the most important thing."" Saliba discussed his situation before Marseille's 3-0 home defeat to Lyon on Sunday, admitting he would welcome the chance to stay at Stade Velodrome beyond the end of the season. ""My wish is to finish well, to leave on a good note in case I don't come back anymore, but I try not to think too much about my future, otherwise I'm less focused on the games,"" the 21-year-old said. ""I'd be happy to come back here, no matter what. It's Marseille, it's my club."" Saliba is under contract at Arsenal until 2024, but is already excited over the prospect of playing Champions League football at Marseille next season, with the club currently sitting second in Ligue 1 with three fixtures remaining. ""The Champions League with OM? When you see the atmosphere in the Conference League or in Ligue 1, I can't even imagine what it would be like on a Tuesday or Wednesday evening,"" he said.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/noni-madueke-psv-english-teen-star-turned-down-man-utd/k46l9p2jgeep1h1sslkxcs4pc,Noni Madueke: PSV's English teen star who turned down Man Utd,"It is no secret that an increasingnumber of young British footballers are exploring opportunities overseas in a bid to earn first-team minutes atan earlier age. Jadon Sancho has proven trailblazer in this regard, inspiring a number of teenagers to follow the Borussia Dortmund starto the Bundesliga. However, Germany's top -flight is not the only league offering youngsters a chance to progress. In Eredivisie, for example, there is a young English talent aiming to make as big an impact at PSV this season as Sancho did during his breakout campaign atDortmund in 2018-19. That player is Noni Madueke. ""[Sancho] has opened the eyes to other talents,” the 18-year-old forward, who joined PSV from Tottenham in 2018,told Voetbal International. “A year after him, I went from Spurs to PSV. The plan that I had in mind then is now workingout the way I intended it. ""In England, it is very difficult as a young talent to get into the first team, especially at the bigger clubs. The squads are very large andthere is little room for youngsters. They often stay in reserve teams for a long time orare loaned out. ""There is little flow or chance to break through. That is completely different in the Netherlands."" Having taken his first steps into the senior ranks in Eindhoven before Covid-19 brought a premature end to the 2019-20 campaign, Madueke is now set to play a key role for the Dutch giants. Before making the switch from England to continental Europe, Madueke spent the entirety of his youth football career at Tottenham, where he captained the club's Under-16s as well as making his debut for the U18s as a 15-year-old. Having been named Player of the Tournament at the prestigious Sonnenland Cup in Germany in 2017, a number of top clubs began to take notice of his potential. Manchester United made an offer to take him north, while Chelsea and Celtic were also linked with his signature. But it was PSV who won the race, with Madueke keen to ensure he earned first-team football sooner rather than later. ""There are so many young players in first teams at the top levelat PSV orAjax,” Madueke told the Daily Mailof the Eredivisie a year on from his arrival in Eindhoven. ""Players like Frenkie de Jong andall of these guys. Skip skip skip 😌 A post shared by  Noni Tristan Madueke (@nonzinoo10) on Dec 23, 2019 at 10:01am PST ""I thought if I want to get to the first team as quickly as possible, then I have to move from Tottenham and come to PSV. ""As long as I keep doing the things they are telling me, I feel like I’ll reach that first-team level sooneras opposed to if I had stayed at Tottenham."" Despite the prospect of opportunities with the senior side, Madueke has had to work his way through ranks during his two years at PSV. Upon his arrival he was introduced into the U17s squad, but after scoring three goals in as many games in December 2018 he was handed a permanent promotion to the U19s, for whom he netted a further four goals that season. In 2019-20, he took his game to new levels, scoring seven goals and providing eight assists in just 11 appearances for the U19sduring the first half of the campaign. Such returns saw him rewarded with a promotion to the Jong PSV squad, who play in the Dutch second division. In six games, he scored four goals, and by early March he was again changing lockers after officially being named as part of the first-team squad. Having made three substitute appearances earlier in the campaign, Madueke's first senior start came against Groningen on March 8, though that turned out to be PSV's final game of the season before coronavirus forced football in the Netherlands to go into hiding. The England youth international played his part in a 1-0 win, and two days later signed a new contract which will keep him at the club until 2024, despite increased interest from Arsenal, Manchester City, RB Leipzig, Valencia and Wolves since the turn of the year. Done Deal! #2024 🙌🏾 A post shared by  Noni Tristan Madueke (@nonzinoo10) on Mar 10, 2020 at 10:07am PDT Blessed with speed, skill and physicality, Madueke has spent much of his young career playing as a winger or wide forward who cuts inside from the right to either score or create goals. However, new PSV boss Roger Schmidt has arrived at Philips Stadion with a plan to play 4-4-2, meaning if Madueke is to earn more opportunities he must now adapt his game so as to become a central striker. He made the perfect start during pre-season, netting a first-half hat-trick against lower-league SC Verle that included a stunning solo strike to secure him the match ball. ""I'm not surprised. He already scored a lot of goals in training. He feels comfortable up front and doesn't have to be a winger,"" Schmidt toldDe Telegraafafter Madueke's superb display of finishing. ""Noni's timing is often very good and he has a good feeling for free space. ""I'm also very happy with his mentality. He is a good fighterand is capable of reading the situation.""  Former PSV midfielder Tommie van de Leegte is excited by what Madueke can provide in his potential new role, telling Omroep Brabant: ""He's fast and has the capability to trick his opponent. He brings creativity and is very explosive in his actions. That's what PSV needs. ""Yes, he's young, but age doesn't matter to me. He has shown himself inpre-season, so I would give him the chance to prove himself in the big games as well."" Though Madueke was not included in Schmidt's starting line-up for PSV's Eredivisie opener against Groningen on Sunday, he certainly did prove himself after coming off the bench in the second half. The teenager provided two assists to help secure a 3-1 win, and it will surely not be long before he is earning regular starts just over two years since the biggest decision his young career. “I wanted to be in the first team as young as possible, at the age of 17or 18,"" Madueke said 12 months ago. ""At a club like Tottenham that is not feasible –you only come into the picture around the age of 20. ""That is why I chose PSV two years ago and what is happeningnow with all the opportunities I get is exactly what I had in mind at the time. ""My choice has provento be the right one.""

https://www.goal.com/en/news/chiesa-injury-nightmare-juventus-transfer-problems/blt18c24820bd46d0fd,Chiesa injury adds to Juventus' transfer problems ahead of daunting Supercoppa showdown with Inter,"Three days on and it is still hard to know exactly what to make of Juventus' insane 4-3 victory at Roma, certainly from the visitors' perspective. Was it an anomaly or a turning point? The Bianconeri are still buzzing, of course. As captain Giorgio Chiellini admitted on Tuesday, it was the kind of win that ""gives you an adrenaline boost"". Marco Landucci had been on the Juventus bench in Rome and Allegri, who was forced to sit in the stands through suspension, was full of praise for his assistant coach, quipping on the eve of Wednesday's Supercoppa Italian showdown with Inter, ""He did really well. In fact, I thought about not turning up tomorrow!"" Landucci, though, will be happy to have his boss back alongside him in the dugout, having admitted that he ""lost five or six years of my life"" watching Juve come from 3-1 down to triumph at the Olimpico, despite the late concession of a penalty and loss of Matthijs de Ligt to a red card. Juve are now unbeaten in seven Serie A games and sit fifth in the standings, just three points behind Atalanta, though the fourth-placed Bergamaschi have played one game fewer. On the face of it, then, the Old Lady seems to have fully recovered from a shocking start to the season and is now perfectly primed to force her way back into the Champions League places. Doubts persist, though. After all, sometimes results can be misleading. Juventus have performed poorly for the majority of the season, and they had only scored 28 times in 20 matches going into Sunday's game. It must also be acknowledged that they were dire for more than an hour at the Stadio Olimpico. Allegri's introduction of Arthur and Alvaro Morata undoubtedly changed the game, and he undeniably deserves credit for his double substitution. Of course, his critics – and their numbers are increasing – would argue that the coach's conservatism has been responsible for Juve's poor productivity this term. They now hope that Allegri will see the benefits of playing Arthur in midfield alongside Manuel Locatelli and will abandon the 4-4-2 formation they deem embarrassingly outdated. Nobody is quite sure how the Tuscan will line his players up against Inter, though – not least because he will have to make do without some key men. Neither Alex Sandro nor Leonardo Bonucci are 100 per cent match fit, Danilo is injured, Juan Cuadrado and De Ligt are both suspended, while Wojciech Szczesny has not yet secured his Covid-19 Green Pass. Of greater significance, though, is the absence of Federico Chiesa. “Forza Federico”💪@GoalItalia pic.twitter.com/9jpYyxhNOl The Euro 2020 star suffered knee ligament damage in the first half of the Roma win and it has since been confirmed that his campaign is over. It is, as Chiellini pointed out, a devastating blow for not just Juve, but Italian football in general, with the winger now also ruled out of March's crucial World Cup play-offs. Even if the Azzurri were to make it to Qatar, there is no guarantee that Chiesa will be fit to feature there either. It is also unclear how Juve will react to his lengthy lay-off. At the very least, it is going to affect their January transfer plans, which were already shrouded in uncertainty because of Paulo Dybala, who was all set to sign an extension beyond the summer but is now set to be offered a new contract worth less than the €10 million (£8.3m/$11.3m) deal he had previously agreed with the club. As previously reported by GOAL, the Bianconeri are desperate to bring in a centre-forward and a central midfielder during the winter window, but they are being severely hampered by their financial issues. Consequently, the hope was that they could raise funds by cashing in on one of their few valuable assets deemed surplus to requirements by Allegri. Dejan Kulusevski was the most likely departure, given he has plenty of admirers in England. However, the versatile Sweden attacker is now the most obvious internal replacement for Chiesa. Allegri has, thus far, demonstrated a distinct lack of faith in Kulusevski, but even if he were to deem Federico Bernardeschi or Cuadrado better options out wide, it still seems unlikely that he would now sanction Kulusevski's sale. ""I talked to him [on Monday],"" Allegri revealed on the eve of the Supercoppa. ""He has great qualities and he can cover various roles. He's starting to understand Juve, as everyone needs to make a jump in quality on a mental level. ""Determination can change a player's career. It's also important that he finds the maturity required for playing certain games."" At the very least, Kulusevski's versatility should ensure he remains in Turin until the summer at least. Consequently, the chances of U.S. men's national team star Weston McKennie being sacrificed in January have risen, particularly with Juve trying to figure out a way to bring in Bruno Guimaraes from Lyon, who want €45m (£36m/$51m) for the Brazilian. The Bianconeri don't have the cash to make that deal happen right now but they could at least make space in their squad – and lower their wage bill in the process – by offloading Arthur, whom Arsenal are interested in taking on loan. Juve's priority, though, remains a centre-forward. Morata made a big impact at Roma, and Allegri insists the Spain striker is staying put despite agreeing personal terms with Barcelona, but Juve have no intention of taking up their option to buy the 29-year-old from Atletico Madrid at the end of the season. Their top target remains Gianluca Scamacca, but the Old Lady is simply not in a position to meet Sassuolo's €40m (£33m/$45m) asking price, and there is no chance of the Neroverdi letting the striker leave on loan midway through the season. It is a similar story with Mauro Icardi. Paris Saint-Germain want either a permanent deal or an obligation to buy inserted into any temporary transfer of the ex-Inter captain. Liverpool super-sub Divock Origi and Manchester United's frustrated French forward Anthony Martial have also been repeatedly mentioned but, again, neither player is expected to leave on loan without at least some money being paid up front. The most likely outcome is a short-term solution, with Sky Sport Italia claiming that the Bianconeri have made contact with Zenit about signing Sardar Azmoun, who is out of contract at the end of the season. Allegri, for his part, insists that the squad will remain unchanged between now and the end of the month. He is merely focused on maintaining the momentum built up over the past six weeks by winning the first trophy of his second spell in Turin. ""We need to think game by game in order to reach those ahead of us [in the table],"" Allegri argued in his pre-match press conference, ""and next season we will see if we have done enough to get back fighting for the Scudetto."" Beating Inter will not be easy of course. The reigning Serie A champions and current league leaders are almost everything that Juve are not right now: prolific, solid and 100 per cent sure of themselves. Allegri himself acknowledges Inter are the strongest team in Italy, while Chiellini says he knew as far back as September that the title was theirs to lose. Juve, then, could be in for a long evening. But, at the very least, the Supercoppa should shed far more light on how much work the Old Lady has to do to get back to the summit of Serie A than last Sunday’s insanity at Stadio Olimpico.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/pepe-s-future-at-arsenal-questioned-after-failing-to-break/blta87e73eb55f00ab8,Pepe's future at Arsenal questioned after failing to break into Arteta's Premier League first XI for six months,"Former Arsenal striker Kevin Campbell has opined winger Nicolas Pepe has no future at the club and should consider leaving. The 26-year-old Ivory Coast international was a purchase for former Gunners manager Unai Emery in 2019. However, he has arguably not shown the value of the over £70 million the North London team paid French outfit Lille for his services.  The attacker has not started a Premier League match for the club in the last six months, and despite the Gunners playing 34 matches already, Pepe has featured just 17 times.  It has been rumoured that Mikel Arteta is willing to let him go at the end of the ongoing campaign despite the player having a contract that runs until June 2024.  ""It has just not worked out. It is that simple. He is a talented player, that’s for sure. But it has not worked out for him,"" Campbell told Football Insider.  ""You see the intensity and focus that Mikel Arteta wants the team to play with. I don’t think Pepe fits into that. He is a drifter. He will concentrate for a bit and then drift out again.  ""I said just before Christmas it was a big few months coming up for Pepe. It was going to determine whether or not he had a future at Arsenal. Well, he doesn’t have a future at Arsenal.""  Arsenal are favourites to finish in the Champions League places this season after a much-improved campaign.  They are currently placed fourth on the table with 63 points from the 34 games they have played. However, they are facing stiff competition from North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur who are a position lower with 61 points.  Spurs have a tricky fixture away to Liverpool this weekend before hosting Arsenal in the London Derby.

Sky Sports News reported on March 31 Ten Hag was in pole position to land the job over Mauricio Pochettino, with sources close to the manager and Ajax revealing compensation is below £2m. The 52-year-old has signed a three-year deal with the option of a further 12 months. He told United's website: ""It is a great honour to be appointed manager of Manchester United and I am hugely excited by the challenge ahead. ""I know the history of this great club and the passion of the fans, and I am absolutely determined to develop a team capable of delivering the success they deserve. ""It will be difficult to leave Ajax after these incredible years, and I can assure our fans of my complete commitment and focus on bringing this season to a successful conclusion before I move to Manchester United."" Mitchell van der Gaag, Ten Hag's assistant at Ajax, is likely to join him at Old Trafford with advanced negotiations already under way. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Edwin van der Sar, Ajax's chief executive and a former United goalkeeper, said, ""we would have liked to have kept Erik for longer"", but added, ""he is going to make the step to one of the biggest clubs in the world"". VOTE: Who should stay or leave Man Utd this summer? Why the scale of Man Utd rebuild is frightening Man Utd exodus: 18 players who could leave this summer Ten Hag Q&A: Carra's verdict on incoming Man Utd boss Ten Hag told Ajax's website: ""I'm happy that it has been finalised and that it has been officially announced. That clarity is important."" John Murtough, United's football director, said: ""During the past four years at Ajax, Erik has proved himself to be one of the most exciting and successful coaches in Europe, renowned for his team's attractive, attacking football and commitment to youth. ""In our conversations with Erik leading up to this appointment, we were deeply impressed with his long-term vision for returning Manchester United to the level we want to be competing at, and his drive and determination to achieve that. ""We wish Erik the best of luck as he focuses on achieving a successful end to the season at Ajax and look forward to welcoming him to Manchester United this summer."" Ten Hag was understood to be the unanimous choice at United following a rigorous recruitment process that was led by Murtough and Darren Fletcher, the technical director. Richard Arnold, the executive vice-chairman, was also involved and the trio are understood to have agreed Ten Hag was the best candidate for the job. Mauricio Pochettino, the Paris Saint-Germain manager who previously coached Tottenham and Southampton, and Julen Lopetegui, the Sevilla boss, were also interviewed by United, but the club are believed to have felt the Dutchman was the one that most closely aligned with their plans for the future. Pochettino and Lopetegui are understood to have interviewed well, while Luis Enrique was also considered until it quickly became apparent he was committed to Spain ahead of this year's World Cup. United were looking for a number of attributes from their new manager, including proven success, a commitment to youth, the ability to improve players and the will to introduce an attractive style of play. Ten Hag is said to have set out his long-term vision to build a successful and exciting team during conversations with United, in which he is also said to have shown enthusiasm for the challenge he now faces at Old Trafford. Sky Sports News understands Ten Hag will tell United players he does not want any passengers at the club. His key message to them will be that he is the manager, there is a new regime and United are going to go back to playing like Manchester United. If there are any players who are not up for the challenge, they are welcome to leave, but everyone will start with a clean slate. He has not been given any specific targets, but he knows his job is to make United great again. Ten Hag also wants Steve McClaren to return to United and talks about making that happen are ongoing. The good relationship between United and Ajax helped smooth the process to appoint Ten Hag. It is believed potential negotiations with PSG, had United opted for Pochettino, would have proved more problematic. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ten Hag will be United's fifth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. The club have won only three trophies in the following nine years - the FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League - while they are currently in danger of missing out on qualification for the Champions League next season. Ten Hag is set to oversee a much-needed rebuild at United, with Rangnick - who is due to take up a consultancy role at Old Trafford this summer - saying after the 4-0 thrashing at rivals Liverpool on Tuesday that the side may need up to 10 new players. A number of first-team players, including Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard and Edinson Cavani, could be set to leave as part of the overhaul, with their contracts expiring at the end of the season. On Wednesday, the departures of Jim Lawlor, United's chief scout, and Marcel Bout, the head of global scouting, were announced. Ralf Rangnick said Manchester United need to sign as many as 10 new players after their 4-0 thrashing by Liverpool on Tuesday night, but which players could leave in their rebuild? Man Utd are currently sixth in the Premier League, three points off the top four but having played a game more than both Tottenham (fourth) and Arsenal (fifth). Will they squeeze into the top four? Here are their remaining fixtures... Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports News' senior reporter Melissa Reddy: ""Manchester United's interest in Erik ten Hag came as no surprise given his status as one of the most progressive coaches in Europe, and his long links to their managerial vacancy. ""The 52-year-old has had admirers at Old Trafford stretching back to 2018/19, when his Ajax side knocked out Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, before then stunning Juventus and only being denied a place in the final after Lucas Moura's last-minute goal for Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham. ""Ten Hag is a popular choice to take charge at Old Trafford and represents what is seen as a ""fresh, exciting future"", although there is an acceptance risk is involved as it is a sizeable leap for him. ""The last highly-successful Ajax coach to move to England's top flight - via Inter - was Frank de Boer, who lasted just 77 days at Crystal Palace. ""The expectations, global glare placed on United, and level of competition at the top end of the Premier League is like nothing he would have previously experienced."" Kaveh Solhekol, Sky Sports' chief reporter: ""The timing is not ideal if you are an Ajax supporter as they are in a race to win the Dutch title, but when Man Utd came calling, Erik ten Hag really could not turn down the club. ""It suits Man Utd to make this statement today for a variety of reasons: from a PR point of view, everybody connected with Man Utd wants some good news at the moment and also, it makes it clear what is happening at Man Utd over the next few months. There is clarity now - all the players who are thinking of leaving, or who Man Utd want to sign, know Ten Hag is going to be the new manager. ""He is also going to have the whole of the summer and pre-season with the players, so that is perfect preparation as far as he is concerned. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I also think it is very significant he is being called the manager - we know one of the things he has been asking for is to be in control of everything. He does not just want to be a head coach - he wants to have control over the transfer strategy and recruitment as well. ""I think Man Utd have made a lot of mistakes when it has come to appointing managers since Sir Alex Ferguson left, but this time round they think they have the right man and obviously he has a big, big job to do. ""But people need to retain a sense of perspective as well - I know the team are not playing as well or in the kind of way a Man Utd team should be playing. But let's not forget, less than 12 months ago, Man Utd finished second in the Premier League, they finished above Liverpool and over the past decade, six of the last 10 seasons they have finished above Liverpool. ""Man Utd are still a massive, massive club - one of the biggest clubs in the world. There are obviously still issues with the ownership structure, the way the club is run, but the big problem is they have not had the right manager in charge, and when they have had the right man, they have not given that manager enough time. ""This time round, when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer lost his job five months ago, we told you the replacement was going to be either Mauricio Pochettino or Erik ten Hag. I know a lot of people would have preferred Pochettino as he had Premier League experience with Southampton and Spurs, so it is a bit of a risk going for Ten Hag. ""Yes, he has done very well in Holland, but he has been managing the biggest club in Holland, he does not have any Premier League experience, but United have spoken to various candidates, they have interviewed Ten Hag, they interviewed Pochettino as well, and they have decided to go for Ten Hag. From United's point of view, it is great they have been able to get Ten Hag and announce it so quickly."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Gary Neville speaking on The Overlap in March: ""Ten Hag worked in Bayern Munich when Pep Guardiola was there. We know the impact that had. He's won a couple of titles and cups in Holland. His style of play is good. He's got more experience than I think most people think at the age of 52. ""It's a massive jump but he's got a good coaching pedigree. He's not scarred and that's a good thing - he comes in fresh. I did a poll the other week and I was absolutely stunned - 220,000 people voted and 82 per cent were in favour of bringing him in over [Mauricio] Pochettino. ""I knew that he would be favourite because you can smell it on social media. I think Manchester United fans are demanding a fresh start and a fresh name. They want something that's completely different that they've not had before, and that's probably gone against Pochettino in some ways."" Sky Sports' Adam Bate: ""Erik ten Hag will go to Manchester United as an outsider tasked with implementing cultural change at one of the world's most famous clubs. But that is a job that he has done before. ""At Ajax, they mocked his accent. He was a Tukker - a man from the east of the country, a region known for a down-to-earth approach. There were those in sophisticated Amsterdam who did not believe the great Ajax had anything to learn from him. They were wrong. ""Two domestic doubles and one kick away from a Champions League final later and there is an acceptance Ten Hag has brought some of the best football that Ajax have seen in years. His methods have delivered success, his manner has won over the doubters."" Ten Hag's coaching journey from Twente to Ajax via Go Ahead Eagles explained in-depth by those who were there from the start... Erik ten Hag must waste no timing in tackling the pressing issues at Manchester United. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick - who is due to take up a consultancy role at Old Trafford this summer - believes the team could require 10 new players as part of a huge rebuild. With United having finally confirmed the appointment of their new manager, Sky Sports takes a look at some of the key problem areas he must rectify...

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/12599944/where-could-each-premier-league-team-finish,Premier League clubs' best and worst possible final positions in table,"Manchester City and Liverpool are locked in a two-horse race for the Premier League title - but how high or low could your club finish this season? Clubs have between two and five games left to seal their fate but 19 out of 20 clubs are still challenging for the title, qualification for the Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League, or to avoid the drop. Data guru Ben Mayhew has calculated each club's range of possible final league positions and found only Norwich have nothing to play for besides pride during the remainder of this season. Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United are all in the hunt to join title-tussling Manchester City and Liverpool in the top four - with Spurs and United potentially slipping as low as eighth to miss out on Europe next season altogether. With seventh spot being the lowest position to potentially offer a European berth, if permutations play out across competitions, it means all teams from fifth to 13th-placed Aston Villa retain the potential to qualify for Europe. Norwich were relegated on Saturday after a 2-0 defeat to Villa and results conspired against them elsewhere, but, theoretically, every single team sitting above the Canaries up to ninth-placed Brighton could finish in the drop zone. Watford have been widely written off in the survival race but the Hornets could still finish in 16th, while the attention for that final relegation spot centres on Everton, Leeds and Burnley - but all three could still secure a top-half finish. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Premier League fixtures Mayhew has also simulated every possible result from the remaining games and calculated the probabilities of each club's possible final positions. The results suggest Manchester City have a 69-per-cent chance of retaining their Premier League crown, while Liverpool have almost the same chance of finishing as runners-up. Chelsea are nailed down for third spot at 93 per cent, with Arsenal pipping Tottenham to the final Champions League berth at 74 per cent - while Manchester United have a whopping 94-per-cent-chance of finishing in their current sixth spot. Each club’s attacking and defensive strength have been rated using an expected goals model, which measures the quality of chances they create and allow.  These ratings were then used to simulate the rest of the season 10,000 times to measure the probability of each club finishing in each league position. Further down the table - between Brighton and Southampton - things become far less predictable, with fairly even spreads between ninth and 15th. The probabilities consign Watford to the Championship but the pressure ramps up for the final drop spot, with Leeds favourites to finish in 18th (46 per cent), followed by Everton (31 per cent) and Burnley (23 per cent).

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/12579011/liverpool-further-in-quadruple-bid-than-any-english-club-in-history,Liverpool's Quadruple quest: How do Jurgen Klopp's side fare in historic bid?,"Liverpool's quest for an historic Quadruple continues when they travel to Villarreal for the second leg of their Champions League semi-final on Tuesday night, with the Reds' bid having now gone further into a season than any other English side before them. Jurgen Klopp's team head to Spain leading 2-0 as they look to progress to the final of Europe's premier club competition in Paris on May 28 against either Man City or Real Madrid. However, even if Liverpool fail to make it to the French capital, they have still managed to surpass the Chelsea side of 2006/07, whose own Quadruple challenge lasted all the way until May 1 of that campaign before losing to Liverpool in the Champions League semi-finals. And if Liverpool do manage to see off Villarreal on Tuesday, their next leg of the Quadruple will come against Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley on May 14, a repeat of this season's League Cup final, which the Reds won on penalties in February. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, in the race for the Premier League, Liverpool still just a point behind City as we enter the final four games of the season after an impressive unbeaten run in the league saw the champions' seemingly unsurmountable 14-point lead on January 15 evaporate. In total, Liverpool could face a gruelling seven-match schedule in May if they make it through to the final of European Cup at the Stade de France. So, how have other English teams got on when faced with such a daunting challenge, while surely the trophy-laden Liverpool sides of the 80s must have gone close to achieving the feat? And what about some of the great European giants of years gone by? Liverpool fixtures Premier League table As is surely common knowledge by now, no English team has ever won the Quadruple. Prior to this season, the closest any top-flight side had ever got to winning all four major trophies in a single campaign was Chelsea back in 2006/07. Heading into May of that season, Jose Mourinho's back-to-back Premier League champions had already landed the League Cup after beating Arsenal 2-1 at the Millennium Stadium, while they had an FA Cup final date to look forward to with Manchester United, who they were also going toe to toe with in the league. However, the Blues' challenge ended when they lost on penalties to Liverpool at Anfield in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final, while they would also go on to lose their title to United. Manchester United also came close to making history in 2008/09, only to slip up in the semi-finals of the FA Cup when losing 4-2 on penalties to Everton, although they did then get beaten 2-0 by Barcelona in that season's Champions League final in Rome. And, of course, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side have had numerous Quadruple bids as well since the Catalan arrived at the Etihad, the closest being in 2018/19 and last season. However, the former challenge was ended by Tottenham in the Champions League last eight and the latter after a defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals. Liverpool's current quest, though, will last at least until May 3, when the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with Villarreal concludes, meaning their Quadruple campaign will have lasted longer than any other English team's in history. And before you ask, Manchester United's famous Treble-winning season of 1998/99 actually included a League Cup quarter-final loss at Spurs in the December of that campaign. You would have thought Liverpool have come close before, but actually they have not, despite winning the League Cup four years in a row from 1981. It was the FA Cup that ultimately proved to be Liverpool's Achilles' heel in each of those four campaigns, with the Reds never managing to make it past the fifth round, meaning the closest they came was in 1982/83, only for a shock 2-1 home defeat to second division Brighton to end their Quadruple dreams in February. And it was Brighton again in the cup who scuppered the Reds' chances of winning all four trophies in their Treble-winning campaign the following season. Oddly enough, despite Klopp's 'Mentality Monsters' barely losing a game between 2018 and 2020, they never actually came close to winning the Quadruple. In fact, the nearest they came to achieving the feat was in their title-winning campaign of 2019/20, only for a youth side - selected because of a fixture clash with the Club World Cup - to lose 5-0 at Aston Villa in the League Cup quarter-finals to put an end that dream. In the first season in England when four trophies were up for grabs in 1960/61, it was Burnley who came closest before losing to Hamburg in the last eight of the European Cup in March 1961. However, Celtic did manage to accomplish the seemingly impossible in 1966-67 when Jock Stein's 'Lisbon Lions' won it all - the Scottish First Division, League Cup and Scottish Cup, followed by the first European Cup won by a British team after victory over Inter Milan. Well, the first thing to point out here is that up until the 2019-20 season, France, as in England, was the only other country in Europe's top-five major leagues to have an extra cup competition in the form of the League Cup, or Coupe de la Ligue. So that explains why European giants like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus have all never previously won the Quadruple. Paris Saint-Germain did, though, recently come within a whisker of pulling it off under Thomas Tuchel, only to fall agonisingly at the final hurdle. The big-spending Parisians were awarded that season's Ligue 1 title in April based on a points-per-game ratio after the campaign was prematurely curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when the season did eventually resume, PSG beat St Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final on July 24, before edging out Lyon 6-5 on penalties to claim the Coupe de la Ligue the following weekend. Then, when the Champions League also returned in August, Tuchel's team made it all the way to the final for the first time in the club's history, before unluckily losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. All of which shows just what a mountain Klopp and Co still face in order to make history this season...

In a press conference by the Austrian FA, Rangnick was appointed the new national team manager until 2024, with a clause inserted into the contract which states that the deal will be renewed for another two years if the country qualifies for Euro 2024. Rangnick was quoted by the Austrian FA website as saying: ""It's an honour for me to take on the role of team boss. I'm particularly excited about the prospect of contesting the European Championships in Germany with a young team hungry for success."" The 63-year-old replaced Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at United at the end of November, agreeing to take temporary charge of the team until the summer, before remaining in a consultancy role. However, results have been disappointing under Rangnick, with United currently sixth in the Premier League, five points behind Arsenal in the fourth and final Champions League spot for next season as the campaign draws to a close. Ajax manager Erik ten Hag was recently announced as United's permanent boss for next season, although Rangnick will, as planned, still stay on as a consultant. That role will encompass six days a month for the next two years, meaning the German would be able to combine the work with his Austria duties. ""I'm very much looking forward to it,"" said Rangnick, when asked about his United consultancy role.

Oddly enough, despite Klopp's 'Mentality Monsters' barely losing a game between 2018 and 2020, they never actually came close to winning the Quadruple. In fact, the nearest they came to achieving the feat was in their title-winning campaign of 2019/20, only for a youth side - selected because of a fixture clash with the Club World Cup - to lose 5-0 at Aston Villa in the League Cup quarter-finals to put an end that dream. In the first season in England when four trophies were up for grabs in 1960/61, it was Burnley who came closest before losing to Hamburg in the last eight of the European Cup in March 1961. However, Celtic did manage to accomplish the seemingly impossible in 1966-67 when Jock Stein's 'Lisbon Lions' won it all - the Scottish First Division, League Cup and Scottish Cup, followed by the first European Cup won by a British team after victory over Inter Milan. Well, the first thing to point out here is that up until the 2019-20 season, France, as in England, was the only other country in Europe's top-five major leagues to have an extra cup competition in the form of the League Cup, or Coupe de la Ligue. So that explains why European giants like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus have all never previously won the Quadruple. Paris Saint-Germain did, though, recently come within a whisker of pulling it off under Thomas Tuchel, only to fall agonisingly at the final hurdle. The big-spending Parisians were awarded that season's Ligue 1 title in April based on a points-per-game ratio after the campaign was prematurely curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when the season did eventually resume, PSG beat St Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final on July 24, before edging out Lyon 6-5 on penalties to claim the Coupe de la Ligue the following weekend. Then, when the Champions League also returned in August, Tuchel's team made it all the way to the final for the first time in the club's history, before unluckily losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. All of which shows just what a mountain Klopp and Co still face in order to make history this season...

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12603750/premier-league-hits-and-misses-jordan-pickford-heroics-inspire-everton-survival-bid,Premier League hits and misses: Juan Mata puts in perfect Man Utd farewell,"How ironic that Juan Mata puts in one of his best Old Trafford performances on his final game at the ground. Eight years after moving to David Moyes's Manchester United from Chelsea, the Spanish number eight appeared to wave goodbye in style. In United's 3-0 win over Brentford on Monday night, Mata rolled back the years to his early Premier League days - who knows if we'll see him in England's top flight again? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mata showed pace, precision and skill that defies his veteran years - linking up with Cristiano Ronaldo frequently in a commanding first-half display. The pair - with a combined age of 71 - showed intricate passing in tight spaces which forced Mata to shoot wide of David Raya's goal - before the duo linked up again for Ronaldo's goal that was ruled out by VAR for offside. Ralf Rangnick recognised how much better United played and perhaps Mata was the cause of that. United had 74 per cent possession of the ball in the first half, with a passing accuracy of 91 per cent. ""That is the reason why we were controlling the game,"" said the German. ""It had to do with the players on the pitch such as Juan, Bruno [Fernandes] and Nemanja Matic."" While players such as Matic have confirmed they will be leaving United this summer, Mata is yet to do so. Rangnick couldn't confirm what the Spaniard will do, but hailed the midfielder's skill and professionalism in equal measure. Premier League table Premier League results Watch Premier League highlights Get Sky Sports ""I don't know [what he will do], he hasn't confirmed that but it's possible [that he will leave]. It was an important night for players who have been here quite a long time. If it was their last game to say farewell like this. ""In the last couple of weeks, he showed how professional he is and how much he loves his game. You can feel and see how much he is a professional player. He almost played like a magician.""Sam Blitz This was Brentford's first defeat with Christian Eriksen in the starting line-up but the Dane was blameless for that at Old Trafford. He was their outstanding performer and one of the best players on the pitch throughout, showcasing that trademark distribution. ""He has been so good, Eriksen,"" said Gary Neville on co-commentary for Sky Sports, before wondering about the player's future in the summer. ""There will be clubs a lot higher up than Brentford looking at him. Manchester United need a new midfield…"" Whether that move will come to fruition is unclear but Eriksen will clearly have options. Despite this being a convincing victory for Manchester United - Brentford were well beaten - the playmaker still created more chances than any player on the home team. It is wonderful to see Eriksen performing at something close to his best. Having proven his fitness and at only 30 years old, there are not many squads that he would not improve. It will be intriguing to find out what he decides to do next. For now, just enjoy him.Adam Bate Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In a World Cup year, the credentials of most of England's regular talent are examined in detail, but none more so than the number one position. Based on Sunday's superhuman display, Gareth Southgate needn't look any further than Jordan Pickford in Qatar - his performance may even be good enough to convince the staunchest of doubters. On a day where Everton's survival bid depended on three points, their goalkeeper was a man mountain. In actual fact, Pickford may have registered not one but two submissions for 'save of the season' - denying both Cesar Azpilicueta and Antonio Rudiger with monumental stops in the second half. ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves,"" said Sky Sports' Graeme Souness. It's difficult to disagree. The Toffees approach to the game was aggressive and that worked to unsettle Chelsea, who were a shade below their level best. Regardless, no player epitomised the game plan more than Pickford, who was dogged and antagonistic from the off. The 28-year-old had to be at his acrobatic best to preserve an all-important clean sheet and coped impressively under some relentless pressure, with Lampard reaffirming why he is so highly thought of on Merseyside: ""Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top level goalkeeping."" In the two Premier League meetings between Everton and Chelsea this season, the England international has managed 14 saves, conceding just once. The result may well be the spark Everton require to pull off a remarkable escape with five games remaining. Needless to say, they will have to exhibit a similar amount of stubbornness in every fixture between now and the end of term if that bid is to be successful.Laura Hunter Everton captain Seamus Coleman: ""That save he came back off the line and parried out was world class, and we see that on a daily basis in training, and that is why he is England's number one - some of the saves were world class.""   Everton boss Frank Lampard: ""Jordan made great saves. They are Chelsea and will have chances, but we had chances as well. Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top-level goalkeeping, I am happy with him and all the players, and all the subs who came on.""   Sky Sports' Graeme Souness: ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves. Some of the saves he's not entitled to get anywhere near them.""   Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp: ""The one to deny Azpilicueta is the save of the season. It was magnificent. We've given Pickford a lot of stick in the past, but he was brilliant."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Rob Holding was a surprise inclusion in Arsenal's team to face West Ham, but he certainly made his mark on the occasion. On a day when Mikel Arteta's side were some way below their fluid best, their stand-in centre-back typified the grit that got them over the line. Holding, starting alongside Gabriel Magalhaes in the absence of the injured Ben White, ensured Arsenal did not miss a player who had started more Premier League minutes than any other this season. He took his goal superbly, rising between two West Ham defenders to flick Bukayo Saka's corner past Lukasz Fabianski, but it was at the other end of the pitch that he truly shone. Shortly before his goal, there was a stunning block to deny the unmarked Manuel Lanzini. It was one of three he made over the course of the 90 minutes - two more than any other player. Holding put his body on the line repeatedly and also made nearly twice as many clearances (seven) as any of his team-mates. He was brave but also smart, positioning himself intelligently to cut out passes and ensure West Ham's forwards rarely threatened. Arteta was delighted by his contribution and talked up his importance in the dressing room - even if he does not get as many opportunities as he would like on the pitch. ""To good people, good things happen,"" said the Arsenal manager in his press conference. ""He's a phenomenal person and when you ask him to come, he's always ready."" With four, nerve-shredding games remaining in a gruelling top-four race, Holding's grit is sure to be needed again. Nick Wright Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tottenham's season has reached a defining stage. The long-awaited north London derby comes after a trip to title-chasing Liverpool, a daunting double before season-ending fixtures against Burnley and already-relegated Norwich. Sunday's victory over Leicester ensured Spurs' destiny remains in their hands ahead of the run-in and provided yet more evidence that Antonio Conte's squad harbours the talent required to complete a task that looked so unlikely when the Italian was appointed. Only Mohamed Salah has more Premier League goals to his name this season than Heung-min Son after the South Korean took his tally to 19 for the campaign in style with Spurs' spectacular third against the Foxes. It came after Son's first-half corner had set up Harry Kane for Tottenham's opener, with the striker ending his five-game goal drought with a clinical stooping header. The rekindling of Kane's goalscoring touch was enhanced by the impact surprise omission Dejan Kulusevski had coming off the bench and setting up both of Son's goals. Spurs' front three are firing - at the perfect time. If Spurs are going to pip north London rivals Arsenal to Champions League football, their front three are going to be crucial. Ahead of a pivotal final four games of the season, the manner of the victory over Leicester should have instilled confidence they can get the job done.Jack Wilkinson Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  North London is chasing. That's what will be at the forefront of Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel's mind after conceding defeat to a team blighted by potential relegation concerns. Perhaps Chelsea legs were tired - a legitimate grievance given they played away at Manchester United three days ago - but their performance was reserved, almost standoffish. Chelsea were far too kind to a side whose desperation could have easily played into their own hands. Chances were spurned, despite a heroic display from Everton stopper Jordan Pickford - over half of Chelsea's attempted shots (11) were off target. And yet there was still no sign of Romelu Lukaku from the bench. Third spot is still the Blues to lose, but both Arsenal and Tottenham are closing in. Stamford Bridge will now be cautiously looking over its proverbial shoulder. Three of Chelsea's six Premier League losses this season have come in their last six games - so is form a problem ahead of an FA Cup final against high-flying Liverpool on May 14? Well, it's clear that a prerequisite of the Chelsea job is silverware - something that Tuchel has previously delivered. But this season threatens to crumble if Chelsea manage to slip out of the top-four race and allow favourites Liverpool to clinch the FA Cup. The latter is the likelier of scenarios, but Chelsea must remain alert. They face Wolves, Leeds, Leicester and Watford in the Premier League run-in; crucially, three of those fixtures are at home. The Blues must draw upon their Stamford Bridge dominance to see them through a tricky patch and ensure they supersede their London rivals in the hunt for a top three finish.Laura Hunter Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Leicester have conceded 14 goals from corners in the Premier League this season, the most of any side, and it once again led to their downfall at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The visitors had started promisingly, with Patson Daka striking the foot of a post from inside the Tottenham area. But against the run of play the hosts took the lead when Harry Kane headed in from a corner, completely unmarked, which spurred them on to a 3-1 victory. Rodgers made eight changes to his side, with their focus firmly on the Europa Conference League semi-finals, yet no matter who they have fielded during this campaign, defending corners has been a constant issue. ""Defending corners has been a problem for us all season - we lack aggression and cuteness. It was so disappointing,"" said Rodgers, whose side have surpassed the most conceded in a single season since Brighton's 16 in 2017-18. ""It is something we will have to look at in the summer through personnel. The mentality to head the ball is missing, it's something we would need to address.""David Richardson Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

The final obstacle in Liverpool's quest to reach a third Champions League final in five seasons sees them head to Spain with a 2-0 advantage after last week's comprehensive first-leg victory at Anfield. Despite holding a commanding advantage, Klopp is under no illusions there is still a job to be done and is relishing the challenge that only Champions League semi-finals produce. ""We know that it is half-time,"" Klopp told his pre-match press conference. ""In the best possible way we have to ignore the result from the first leg. If it were a cup game where only one game decided, and we had to go to Villarreal, we would try to win there. ""We know they will give all they have, that is absolutely clear. With all the things Unai said after the game… it's going to be a tough one but that is completely fine. Champions League semi-finals should be tough; we never expect them to be easy and this will not be easy. But we played a good game at home and we better play a good game there as well."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Klopp continued: ""At this moment, a Champions League semi-final is the most important game you can play. Whatever happened in the last few weeks or will happen in the next few weeks is not important, for this moment is clear. ""You never know if you will reach a semi-final again or if we will ever have the chance again to go to the final, you never know. We have an exceptional team here and nothing is for granted.

Klopp is adamant Liverpool are prepared for such an examination in order to progress through their Champions League semi-final and reach the third final of his tenure on Merseyside. ""We have to be ready to suffer,"" Klopp added. ""Not being a goal down - which can happen - but giving the game the right direction. ""A good example was Newcastle. The crowd was very passionate but we didn't let it happen, which was the biggest quality for this game. It wasn't a show of football brilliance. Of course we could have scored more goals but how clear-cut the performance was incredible. ""Yes we have to be emotional, ready to play the best game ever, but knowing it will not happen in moments. Suffering doesn't mean you suffer for long, you suffer and then you react."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Klopp added: ""Maturity and experience are very important, but they are not the only decisive things. You can be old and know everything about football but unable to play anymore, so that cannot be useful. ""Everything what we are will be required tomorrow night, that's it. We have to be ready to play a top, top game because they will go for us. They will high press, they will try to play much more football than we allowed them in the first game. ""Unai will for sure try to adapt a few things to our style. It will be really interesting. Maturity will be important but it's not the only thing."" Villarreal manager Unai Emery admits his side need to play the perfect game if they are to shock Liverpool to reach the club's first Champions League final. The former Arsenal boss was reminded their opponents had lost just three of 56 matches in a quadruple-chasing season. ""I didn't want to hear those details but I did,"" he said. ""It is a difficult task but we are working on the game. We need to play a perfect game. ""We need to find our excellence in certain things and maybe achieve something no one has achieved, which is this kind of comeback. We will try to find some weak spots, something that no one has done this season."" There was some positive news for Emery with striker Gerard Moreno, who missed the first leg, back after injury, although they will be missing former Bournemouth winger Arnaut Danjuma who is ill. ""Gerard trained with the rest of the group today,"" said the Villarreal boss. ""I don't know to what extent he will be fit for contention. We will not take any risks."" Sky Sports' Gary Neville: ""I really enjoyed the Liverpool-Villarreal first leg. Villarreal were massive underdogs, defending so deep in the 4-4-2 system. I thought highly of Liverpool and their persistence. ""Liverpool were doing the right things. Liverpool are a team who can win in different ways. They can outbox you; they can go toe to toe with you, punch for punch and they can be patient. Liverpool have demonstrated that in the last few years, they can wait, they can pass it around, they don't get panicky. ""I remember that game where they lost the title under Brendan Rodgers- they didn't have the experience to handle a different type of opponent. When Chelsea held back that day, they got very frustrated. ""I think it was a really good performance from Liverpool in the first leg, it was really professional. They should win that game, no doubt. Liverpool certainly [will qualify] - and that doesn't mean I don't respect Villarreal."" Sky Sports' Gary Neville: ""Liverpool are seven games from a Quadruple - seven games from a quadruple. That is the closest I think that anybody will ever have been to a Quadruple. I might be wrong. Someone will probably prove me wrong, but I can't think of a time. ""If Liverpool were to do it that would be unprecedented. Unprecedented achievements. So they, along with Manchester City, are on the brink of greatness.""

Clubs have between two and five games left to seal their fate but 19 out of 20 clubs are still challenging for the title, qualification for the Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League, or to avoid the drop. Data guru Ben Mayhew has calculated each club's range of possible final league positions and found only Norwich have nothing to play for besides pride during the remainder of this season. Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United are all in the hunt to join title-tussling Manchester City and Liverpool in the top four - with Spurs and United potentially slipping as low as eighth to miss out on Europe next season altogether. With seventh spot being the lowest position to potentially offer a European berth, if permutations play out across competitions, it means all teams from fifth to 13th-placed Aston Villa retain the potential to qualify for Europe. Norwich were relegated on Saturday after a 2-0 defeat to Villa and results conspired against them elsewhere, but, theoretically, every single team sitting above the Canaries up to ninth-placed Brighton could finish in the drop zone. Watford have been widely written off in the survival race but the Hornets could still finish in 16th, while the attention for that final relegation spot centres on Everton, Leeds and Burnley - but all three could still secure a top-half finish. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Premier League fixtures Mayhew has also simulated every possible result from the remaining games and calculated the probabilities of each club's possible final positions. The results suggest Manchester City have a 69-per-cent chance of retaining their Premier League crown, while Liverpool have almost the same chance of finishing as runners-up. Chelsea are nailed down for third spot at 93 per cent, with Arsenal pipping Tottenham to the final Champions League berth at 74 per cent - while Manchester United have a whopping 94-per-cent-chance of finishing in their current sixth spot. Each club’s attacking and defensive strength have been rated using an expected goals model, which measures the quality of chances they create and allow.  These ratings were then used to simulate the rest of the season 10,000 times to measure the probability of each club finishing in each league position. Further down the table - between Brighton and Southampton - things become far less predictable, with fairly even spreads between ninth and 15th. The probabilities consign Watford to the Championship but the pressure ramps up for the final drop spot, with Leeds favourites to finish in 18th (46 per cent), followed by Everton (31 per cent) and Burnley (23 per cent).

""They were organised, they were decent, and they didn't get that luck. They were a bit frantic in the final third and they've got to stop conceding goals from defensive set pieces. ""Losing Liam Cooper and Stuart Dallas is a problem there. It's been the story of their season. ""They do things that teams go down do. They concede goals from set pieces, they are frantic in the final third and they do lack composure, but I do think if they can put four performances in like the one against Man City, it keeps them up.""

They haven't got the momentum with a couple of tough games coming up. Burnley have had some great results. ""Everton are going to have to get something from Leicester and Watford. With Watford being virtually down, you'd imagine Everton will have the edge there. Leicester, are they still going to be in Europe? That's another question by the time that fixture comes up. They need to go on the road and become a better team than they have been. ""The teams you want to play are the ones in mid-table, the ones that are maybe psychologically on the beach.

""They've been a different team when they've played at home, but can they now change that mindset away? If they can, then they'll stay in the Premier League. If they can't, then they'll go down.

""The question you've got to ask yourself is, why has it not been like that all season? ""It's in the players, you can't just do it when the crowd are up for it. They have to be like that in every remaining game."" Sky Sports' Gary Neville speaking on The Gary Neville Podcast: ""Burnley's comeback was a surprise. It shocked us and it would have shocked Leeds United. When asked about Burnley's revival, Neville added: ""I know a few Burnley fans and we were all horrified when Sean Dyche got sacked. We were all shocked because maybe we are not as close to the situation internally at Burnley. ""Burnley fans were respectful of the job Sean Dyche had done.

Dyche has put that into those players, but if the same voice of the manager has talking to the players every day for a large number of years there comes a point whereby the manager is tired of talking to the players and the players are tired of hearing from that manager.

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12598812/who-qualifies-for-europe-how-premier-league-could-have-nine-teams-in-european-competitions-next-season,Who qualifies for Europe? How Premier League could have nine teams in European competitions next season,"The race for Europe is on but which teams make it - and how many - is still to be decided. With the Premier League campaign reaching its climax, we look at: There are seven European spots open to English sides - although that number could rise to nine and the amount of teams in each individual competition can shift. As a basis: However, because this season the FA Cup winner will be either Liverpool or Chelsea, and both those teams look set to finish in the top four, their Europa League qualifying spot for winning the FA Cup will be passed down to the next highest Premier League finisher who doesn't qualify for Europe. Similarly, because Liverpool won the Carabao Cup and are set to finish in the top four, their Europa Conference League qualifying spot from that competition will go to the next highest Premier League finisher without European football. So that means sides which finish sixth and seventh in the Premier League table are in contention for a place in either the Europa League or Europa Conference League next season. Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal would qualify for the Champions League by finishing in the Premier League's top four positions. Tottenham would go into the Europa League, along with Manchester United (who would get in thanks to Chelsea or Liverpool passing on their spot from winning the FA Cup). Seventh-placed West Ham would qualify for the Europa Conference League, thanks to Liverpool's Carabao Cup winner's spot being passed on. Manchester City and Liverpool have pulled clear at the top of the Premier League, and while their battle to win the Premier League title continues, they don't have to worry about Champions League qualification. Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp will still be plotting how to win this year's competition, and could meet in the final, but they already have their places in next season's tournament wrapped up through the league. Meanwhile, the last two spots in the top four are still up for grabs with Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham in contention with four games remaining. However, whatever the outcome, it will be a top-six finish at the very least for Chelsea and Arsenal, who return to European competition after missing out last season. Although not mathematically done yet, Spurs have all but guaranteed a Europa League spot with a nine-point gap between them and seventh-placed West Ham, who have just three matches left to play this season. Antonio Conte's side also have a far superior goal difference to the Hammers. The battle for the final Europa League spot continues between Man Utd and West Ham, while Wolves also have their eyes on finishing seventh and potentially securing a place in the Europa Conference League. If Manchester City or Liverpool win the Champions League they will automatically qualify for the competition's group stages next season. That is irrespective of where they finish in the Premier League table. If they qualify for the competition through two methods - ie: they win it and finish in the top four - there is no extra Champions League spot created for another team to fill and the number of Premier League clubs in next season's Champions League will remain at four. The Premier League could have a maximum of five teams in the Champions League next season, though, if West Ham won the Europa League and finished outside the top four. Winning that competition qualifies them for the Champions League group stages. If Leicester win the Europa Conference League they will automatically qualify for next season's Europa League - another additional European spot. That means, if West Ham and Leicester win their competitions and finish outside the Premier League's top seven there will be nine English sides in European competition next season. The nine sides would be: the top four and West Ham in the Champions League, fifth and sixth place, plus Leicester, in the Europa League, and seventh place in the Europa Conference League. But if Leicester were to win the Europa Conference League and finish seventh - the place set to be rewarded with a Europa Conference League spot - there would be no English side in the Europa Conference League next season, as Leicester would be bumped up to the Europa League. That happened in Spain last season with Sevilla and no La Liga side involved in the Europa Conference League. With Liverpool and Manchester City in the Champions League semi-finals, there's a good chance an English side would win the tournament - but that would have no impact on European qualification, with both sides set to finish in the top four. West Ham are into the semis of the Europa League and an additional Champions League spot is up for grabs if they win that competition. Their Europa Conference League spot for finishing seventh would disappear.Leicester - 10 points off seventh with two games in hand - could be playing European football again next year if they progress from their semi-final and win the Europa Conference League to earn an additional spot in the Europa League. Regardless of any permutation, no side finishing eighth in the Premier League will qualify for Europe, unless they've won a domestic or European cup. Eighth-placed Wolves would be the highest-finishing Premier League team to miss out on European football, although they are just three points behind West Ham and five off Manchester United, with a game in hand on both.

""People talk about this incident and say: 'Is it a red-card offence from the goalkeeper?' ""For a red-card offence, it would have to be serious foul play. I'm not saying he didn't go to take the player. He wants to stop the player, there is no doubt about that.

Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table ""On balance, I think the best decision would probably be no yellow card for simulation. Let's accept the goalkeeper went rashly, if you like, the player took evasive action, but he didn't simulate."" Gallagher added: ""I don't think a player has to suffer serious injury for it to be a serious offence. ""I do think it is very difficult to pull out a red card for a player who hasn't made contact with another player. I don't say impossible, but it is very difficult. ""On this occasion, the goalkeeper was rash. He took a risk. The goalkeeper has in his mind that he's got to stop the player and I think he's got lucky. ""Bowen had to evade him, there is no doubt about it, and that is why I think no yellow card. If the referee had just given a throw-in, I think that'd be more acceptable.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Warnock: Ramsdale's rash. Stephen Warnock on Sky Sports News: ""Ramsdale's rash ""I think it is a foul by Ramsdale because of the speed in which he comes out.

Smith: No Bowen booking, but Ramsdale's lucky Sue Smith on Sky Sports News: ""It's a really interesting debate. I don't think Bowen should have been booked for it because as a player, when you are running through at so much pace, you knock the ball around and you see the challenge coming in. You see Ramsdale coming at you with so much pace and you do everything to avoid it because you don't want to get injured. ""He certainly shouldn't have got a yellow card for that and I'm more in favour that it should have been a foul by Ramsdale, even though he didn't make contact.

There's no doubt about that because the game goes on. ""The ball may have touched his arm, but it wasn't deemed a handball because it was totally accidental. The referee quite rightly says play on.

You need to look at this.' ""As you've said, it has already unfolded that the FA are to investigate it and we'll see what happens after that."" When asked about the procedure with the ref having a lot to remember, Dermot added: ""That's the benefit of the fourth official. The fourth official will coordinate everything for him, they will talk after the match and put the report in based on what they've seen together. ""It's about accumulating as much information as you can, relaying it to the FA, and the FA dealing with it. ""The referee would have to be convinced that it is a danger to a spectator, if he's thrown it into the crowd like that. It doesn't show where it went.

""If a penalty is given, I don't think he's got a lot of argument. ""As it was, I don't think the referee saw it and the VAR wasn't convinced so it was play-on, but I think he was lucky. ""VAR wasn't convinced because it is a subjective decision. Has the ball struck his arm? Has he moved his arm into it? I think because of the way he is turning his body he's moved towards the ball. Other people say no. ""There were four people in the studio on Sunday and two thought penalty and two thought no. That's where you are."" 'Son's body language points to penalty' Stephen Warnock on Sky Sports News: ""I think it's a penalty and what you can also see from the incident is, Son's under no pressure when that ball drops to him once he's handled it and it drops at his feet. ""Now he knows he's clear of Ayoze Perez but look at him lash at the ball. It's almost like he's saying he's made a mistake and that's a natural reaction when you think you've done something wrong. You panic. ""If he's thinking I haven't handled the ball I think he'd have run with it out of the box. Body language comes into it again, but I think it's a penalty."" 'Son's arm is close to his body' Sue Smith on Sky Sports News: ""I think this is where subjectivity comes in because I don't think it is a penalty. ""I think his arm is quite close to his body and he just gets in between. The ball does touch his arm but I don't think he's actually moved his arm to the ball.""

Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp's sides look destined to remain almost neck-and-neck until the very end of the Premier League season for the second time in four years with both sides victorious on Saturday, to leave City a point ahead in the standings with four games remaining. Both sides rested players due to their Champions League semi-final commitments but after a Mo Salah-less Liverpool edged to a 1-0 win at Newcastle in the lunchtime kick-off, Manchester City saw off a Leeds side unbeaten in five games with a 4-0 victory at Elland Road to leapfrog them back to the top of the table, despite making five changes from their match with Real Madrid in midweek. Neville told the Gary Neville Podcast the two teams had transformed the title race from the ""fights"" of his time as a player at Manchester United into a spectacle both appear to enjoy, with the increasing pressure of keeping up with their title rival never showing - and the prospect of a faultless end to the season a real possibility. He said: ""The thing that actually City have done tonight, which is massively impressive, but they make it look easy, is that when we were up against the team going for a title and they played before us, we always wanted to play first. ""When Liverpool have gone and done what they did at lunchtime today at Newcastle, after Villarreal in midweek and all the games they've had recently, you're thinking that switches the pressure to City, but you never really get the impression that these two teams feel that pressure.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Neville felt both Klopp and Guardiola took a chance by making changes for Saturday's Premier League matches - but says to have come through unscathed will be of huge benefit to both teams in the remaining games this season, with fringe players feeling more confident and ready to make an impact off the bench in pivotal moments. ""What Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola are doing today is, they're basically empowering the squad,"" said Neville. ""You hear managers say 'I've got a great squad', but have you got the guts and the courage to really use that squad in big matches where you need to win? ""Where you know if you don't win there is a large consequence, or you're probably going to lose a league title, or you're going to get knocked out of a European Cup competition. So to do it and then come out of it and win - you've empowered everybody. ""You've made everybody feel part of it, and the strength in that squad and the commitment of everybody means that you start to blend into the feeling of every three days, you know everyone's had a game, no one feels like there's a first eleven. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It's a real mistake to name your first eleven, then always play that first eleven in modern football, if you're going to go for three and four trophies because you're going to need those five and six and seven on the bench. And so to keep them included to make them feel part of it, get them on the pitch if you can, even it's for 10 or 15 minutes at the end. ""It's really critical that you make everybody feel proud of being part of the squad because there is absolute certainty there is going to come a game that will catch you out, and you're going to need two or three subs to come on and save you. That could be a defensive sub, it could be an attacking sub as well more often than not. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""We had it in the Champions League final, where we had two subs come off the bench and win it for us. Liverpool have that in them, Manchester City have that in them, but you need to keep those players in form, confident, fit, part of it, energised. Making them feel like they're contributing to the success, and it's not just a token gesture where you're being played in the sort of weak games."" ""It's the first time Jurgen Klopp's left Mo Salah out in what feels like an absolute age, but he must have felt that was a game that he could leave him out in. Why he thought that, we don't know. But when I saw that, I thought, 'Right, what message does that send to the rest of the Liverpool players?'. ""I just thought because he's played Salah in every game, the game that he leaves Salah out in, I thought would be a risk because it tells the rest of the players something. I just thought there was a risk there when I saw the team news come through. I thought that's a test for the other players because they know this guy is going to come straight back in against Villarreal. They know he's number one. So can we get through without him? ""So those Liverpool players come off today getting through without him, and City have got through without De Bruyne, and I think that's the two best players - I think Van Dijk competes with Salah in terms of importance - but those are the two star players.

Loadingâ¦ Goal celebrations aren't always as happy as they could be, which Richarlison could potentially find out in the wake of throwing a flare back towards the crowd. In 2017, Van Persie was involved in a very angry goal celebration, after scoring in an Istanbul derby during a very heated Turkish Cup game. The Dutchman and Ozyakup had been mates when the pair were at Arsenal at the same time, though the Turkish international only ever played twice for the Gunners. However when the pair met in Turkey things went downhill quickly, with them exchanging words during the game after Ozyakup's teammate Dusko Tosic was sent off for pushing Van Persie.

Whilst it got him three days off, it also temporarily ended the striker's friendship with Ozyakup, with the midfielder admitting he'd lost respect for his former teammate. ""I was very good friends with a certain player on the field. That changed today,"" he said after the game. âSometimes you see the real face of a footballer on the field.â Whilst the Besiktas man admitted later in that year that they still weren't talking, adding, ""I do not think I was in the wrong, if anything I was wrong to show Robin as much respect as I did,"" thing eventually got better. The two men eventually reunited in 2020 after Van Persie had moved back to Feyenoord, his first club, Ozyakup joined the team on loan, whilst his former teammate, turned enemy, was on the coaching staff.

Loadingâ¦ Six years ago, Leicester were on the verge of the most incredible league winning campaign in the history of the Premier League's history. Having narrowly avoided relegation the previous season, the club had appointed Claudio Ranieri in the summer and the team went on an incredible run to make the impossible suddenly seem possible. On May 2nd title chasers Tottenham Hotspur, themselves trying to win a first league title since 1961, travelled to champions Chelsea in a must win game. The Blues were having a dreadful season but knew that stopping London rivals Spurs picking up all three points would result in Leicester being crowned champions. Whilst things were about to heat up in London, the Foxes' players gathered at Vardy's house to watch the game, as life imitated art, with the fan's ""Jamie Vardy's having a party"" chant came to life. The game at Stamford Bridge would become to be known as the 'Battle of the Bridge,' but it started in relatively basic circumstances for that campaign. Harry Kane scored his 25th goal of the league season, and when Son Heung-min doubled the lead before half time it looked like the champagne would have to be put on ice, as Spurs eyed their first win away to the Blues since 1990. A challenge by Danny Rose on Willian sparked angry scenes, with Mauricio Pochettino entering the pitch to split the two men, before Moussa Dembele gouged Diego Costa's eyes in the melee. Spurs were lucky Rose wasn't sent off for the challenge but then at half time momentum shifted as Eden Hazard was brought on as a substitute. Chelsea got on top with the introduction of the Belgian, despite his poor season to that date, but it was Gary Cahill who scored their first goal. Hazard grabbed the equaliser with seven minutes to go and things got uglier with challenges flying in from the visitors, inspired by the Chelsea players who had said they wanted to get one over their rivals and help Leicester, in the build up to the match. When the full time whistle blew it ended Spurs' slim hopes of winning the league and sparked incredible scenes at Vardy's house party. This will never ever grow old ð¬#OnThisDay in 2016, the Foxes squad assembled.You know what happened next... ð¦ ð ð pic.twitter.com/KNv1V1hkvK Ranieri's side then faced Everton five days later at the King Power Stadium, where the fans were able to join their heroes in celebrating the title.

It wasn't Spurs who they beat however, with Pochettino's side losing 5-1 to relegated Newcastle United on the final day and slipping behind Arsenal into third. Though it was the Battle of the Bridge that ended up giving Leicester their incredible title, that night it was all about the scenes at the Vardy residence.

Loadingâ¦ The Gunners went back into fourth on Sunday evening thanks to goals from Rob Holding and Gabriel. West Ham were hoping for a positive result so they'd have momentum heading into Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg clash with Eintracht Frankfurt, with the score currently 2-1 to the Bundesliga side. It didn't happen however and late on, the usually calm and composed Rice got in Nketiah's face. Rice saying who tf are you to a guy heâs known since he was 9ð¤£ pic.twitter.com/49qDkWOKwl Nketiah had just been booked for a minor scuffle with Aaron Cresswell and after that died down, Rice decided to get in the face of his fellow Chelsea academy alumni. Fredericks came over to calm the 23-year-old down but he wouldn't let it go and continued to hassle Nketiah before Martin Odegaard intervened. Fans reacted to the incident and they aren't entirely sure what went on. One commented: ""It's very rare Dec loses his s**t like this but you can see why he did today."" Another said: ""Tbh I like his frustration. Would kill for Rice in our midfield."" A third put: ""Proud of Nketiah stood up hands down to show no intention of fighting."" While someone tweeted: ""Iâm not quite sure why Rice wasnât given a yellow for this!?!"" Arsenal took the lead through Holding, who was a late addition to the team after Ben White's withdrawal through injury. Jarrod Bowen equalised for David Moyes' side just before halftime with his 10th goal of the season. Shortly after the break, Gabriel joined centre back partner Holding on the scoresheet with a header of his own. Mikel Arteta's side held on and leapfrogged Tottenham Hotspur in the table with four games remaining. The Spaniard was delighted with his side's 'ugly' performance and thinks it'll help them qualify for next season's Champions League. ""Itâs a massive win, under very difficult circumstances because we put ourselves in real problems, especially with our decision making and in ball possessions, and the spaces we were attacking, and the timing of it and the efficiency of it,"" Arteta explained post-match. ""But the team showed huge character, not to give up, to continue trying to do the right things. ""The way they fought, the way they understood how they have to manage the game in certain moments, with the way we defended, because we didnât concede anything, it was phenomenal. ""In England you say 'win ugly', I think from my point of view today we won ugly, and Iâm extremely happy to see a team that has this capacity to find a way to win and show the character that they showed today.""

He reckons his body of work throughout his career at Palace shouldn't go unnoticed. Vieiraâexplained: ""Wilfried is a little bit likeMatt Le TissierI would say. When you play at Palace, at Southampton, you may not get the credit that you deserve if you're not playing in one of the top four, top five teams. ""Hopefully they will get to the HallofFame because what they did for Crystal Palace and [Southampton] you canât take that away.""

""It's a different way of looking at quality, talented players.Wilfried Zaha and Matt Le Tissier, they deserve a lot of credit for what they achieved for their respective football clubs.""â Zaha has spent the majority of his career atSelhurst Park. He's been an ever-present since returning to the club in 2014 following his failed transfer at Manchester United.

However, after previously struggling to nail down a regular first-team spot in the Arsenal side, the striker has gone on to make four consecutive starts since leading the line at Southampton back in April. Due to his upturn in opportunities and form, the Daily Mail are reporting that the Arsenal hierarchy will make one last effort to convince Nketiah to sign a new deal in order to extend his stay. Although, the report outlines how Nketiah is said to be holding out until the end of the campaign to discuss his future, with several clubs said to be interested in acquiring his signature on a free transfer deal once the season comes to a close, including Crystal Palace. After recently featuring in the Arsenal starting lineup, the England Under-21s international has gone on to make 17 Premier League appearances so far this season, scoring two goals, which both arrived in the recent 4-2 win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/barcelona-priced-out-of-ruben-neves-move_484864.html,Barcelona 'priced out of Ruben Neves move',"The 25-year-old has enjoyed another strong campaign in the heart of the Wolves midfield with four goals and two assists from 29 Premier League appearances for the European hopefuls. Lage's side were at one point challenging for an unlikely Champions League berth, but a drop-off in form has left them outside of the European places in eighth position - three points adrift of West Ham United with a game in hand. Neves now only has two years left on his contract with the Molineux side, and failure to secure a continental spot for the 2022-23 season could tempt the Portugal international into a move elsewhere. Arsenal and Manchester United have both been linked with a swoop for Neves, with the Red Devils understood to have recently sent scouts to watch the midfielder in action for Wolves. Despite the impending arrival of Franck Kessie from AC Milan on a free transfer, Barcelona are also thought to be keen to bring Neves to Catalonia as part of their summer overhaul. © Reuters While Lage has admitted that it may be difficult for Wolves to keep hold of Neves this summer, the Portuguese has insisted that the midfielder is worth at least £100m in the upcoming market. ""These days we need to be ready for everything. A player like this has a value of £100m. Anything can happen, not just with Ruben. If we want to improve we need the best guys at the best price,"" Lage told reporters at a press conference last week. As a result, Sport claims that Barcelona will therefore be priced out of a move for Neves, who they had initially identified as an ideal long-term replacement for Sergio Busquets. Busquets will celebrate his 34th birthday in July and still has one more year to run on his deal with the Blaugrana, but Barcelona are understandably planning for life without the Spaniard. The report adds that Barcelona are not closing the door on a move for Neves fully, with Wolves unable to play hardball in negotiations should the Portuguese continue to wind his contract down. Neves allegedly dreams of pulling on the Barcelona shirt, meanwhile, and agent Jorge Mendes's strong working relationship with the Catalan side could ultimately aid a bid for the former Porto youngster. © Reuters Neves arrived at Wolves in the summer of 2017 after rising through the ranks in Porto's youth system and immediately helped the club achieve promotion to the Premier League with six goals in 42 Championship matches in 2017-18. The lynchpin has gone on to make 208 appearances for the Molineux outfit in all competitions, scoring 24 goals and providing 12 assists in that spell. Fifteen of those goals and eight assists have come in 138 Premier League appearances, and he has made the starting lineup on 27 occasions in the top flight this season. Neves had missed the start of April due to a knee injury but was fit enough to play the first 45 minutes of the weekend's 3-0 loss to Brighton & Hove Albion - Wolves' fourth defeat in five Premier League games. As well as Neves, Barcelona are also reported to be interested in Valencia midfielder Carlos Soler, but Los Che were recently forced to release a statement denying the existence of a €20m (£16.8m) transfer agreement between the two clubs.

Tielemans has remained an integral cog in the Leicester engine room this season, and he is not expected to be short of suitors if he seeks a move away from the FA Cup holders. The likes of Liverpool, Real Madrid and Man United have all been credited with an interest in the Belgium international, while Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur have also been linked with summer swoops. Despite reported interest from a wide range of Premier League clubs, journalist Sacha Tavolieiri has put Real Madrid on red alert by claiming that Tielemans has his heart set on a move to La Liga. © Reuters ""While he should leave Leicester City this summer, Youri Tielemans would have told those around him his preference for a departure to Spain,"" Tavolieri tweeted. ""The Real Madrid, interested, could position itself concretely in the coming weeks... To be continued."" Real Madrid are not short of midfield options at present having secured the signature of Eduardo Camavinga, while Luka Modric has also allegedly agreed to stay on for at least one more season. However, with Modric now approaching the final knockings of his career while Toni Kroos and Casemiro continue in their 30s, Real boss Carlo Ancelotti could plan for the future with 24-year-old Tielemans alongside Camavinga and Federico Valverde. Real are understood to have enquired about Tielemans's availability in the January transfer window but decided against a move when learning of the Belgium international's £50m price tag. Manchester United's midfield is also expected to undergo a major overhaul this summer, with Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba expected to depart as free agents at the end of their contracts. Tielemans is expected to be one of several targets on the Red Devils' wishlist this summer, with a recent report claiming that James Ward-Prowse was also being eyed up by Erik ten Hag. © Reuters Tielemans initially arrived on loan at the King Power Stadium for the second half of the 2018-19 season and was immediately snapped up on a permanent deal after providing three goals and five assists in those six months. The former Anderlecht youngster has since gone on to register 24 goals and 23 assists in 153 appearances for Rodgers's side, including the winning goal in the final of last season's FA Cup against Chelsea. Tielemans's statistics this season include seven goals and four assists from 44 matches continentally and domestically, with six of those strikes coming in Premier League action. However, with the Europa Conference League semi-final second leg with Roma in mind, Tielemans was only brought off the bench for the final 14 minutes of Sunday's 3-1 loss to Tottenham Hotspur. Tielemans's feats in the 2020-21 campaign also saw him rewarded with the club's Player of the Season accolade, but his contract situation could supposedly lead to Leicester to consider bids in the region of £25m this summer.

Man United continue to be strongly linked with the France international, with Ralf Rangnick believed to have recommended that the club sign him during this summer's transfer window. Rangnick will continue to lead the Red Devils on an interim basis for the remainder of the season before taking on a consultancy role, where he will be involved in recruitment. © Reuters However, according to Calciomercato, Man United will have strong competition from Milan for the signature of Nkunku in the upcoming market. The report claims that the attacker's agent Pini Zahavi is already working on an exit for his client this summer, and there are a number of clubs believed to be keen on his signature. The Serie A giants would have a significant budget this summer if their proposed Bahraini takeover is completed, with the club potentially spending as much as €300m (£249m) ahead of next season. Arsenal and Inter Milan have also been credited with an interest in Nkunku, who is capable of operating in a number of different positions in the final third of the field. Offers in the region of £52m would allegedly be considered by Leipzig, but Man United could potentially miss out on the chance to sign him, as they will almost certainly not be able to offer Champions League football during the 2022-23 campaign. © Reuters Nkunku has starred in the Bundesliga this season, scoring 17 goals and registering 15 assists in 31 appearances, while he netted seven times and provided two assists in six appearances in the group stage of the Champions League. The Frenchman has operated in a number of different positions for his German club this term, featuring off both the left and the right, in addition to playing through the middle. Nkunku only has little over two years left to run on his contract at Leipzig, meaning that the Bundesliga side are not in a strong position when it comes to his future, unless they can convince him to sign an extension. Man United interim head coach Ralf Rangnick recently said that two new forwards could arrive at Old Trafford during this summer's transfer window.

Despite both teams sloppily gifting possession away in the opening exchanges, Arsenal made the breakthrough as Holding - deputising for the injured Ben White - headed home his first Premier League goal from Bukayo Saka's corner. However, Jarrod Bowen's deflected finish off the leg of Gabriel Magalhaes ensured that David Moyes's side would restore parity before half time, but the Brazilian defender soon went from zero to hero for Arsenal. Gabriel Martinelli's cross to the back stick met the head of an unmarked Gabriel, whose header proved too powerful for ex-Arsenal man Lukasz Fabianski to keep out in a 2-1 success for the North London club. © Reuters Arsenal have now maintained their two-point lead over Tottenham Hotspur with only four games left to play this season, and Arteta made sure Holding's contribution did not go unnoticed.

Barcelona have been strongly linked with the experienced striker, and it has been claimed that the La Liga club have already met with his agent Pini Zahavi to discuss a switch this summer. However, when questioned on the recent speculation, Alemany insisted that his club had not held a meeting with the Bayern forward's representative. © Reuters ""There was no meeting with Lewandowski's agent.

Lewandowski recently suggested that he would be open to leaving Bayern in the upcoming market, with the Bundesliga giants looking for a fee in the region of £33m. Manchester United have also been strongly linked with the forward, as the Red Devils prepare to bring at least one new attacker to Old Trafford in the upcoming market. However, Barcelona are believed to be in pole position for his signature, with Lewandowski thought to be keen to play in Spain before the end of his career. © Reuters The Poland international has scored 343 goals and registered 71 assists in 373 appearances for Bayern since making the move from Borussia Dortmund in July 2014. Lewandowski has won eight Bundesliga titles, three German Cups and the Champions League during his time at Allianz Arena, but he is thought to be keen on a fresh challenge ahead of next season.

Gnabry only has little over a year left to run on his contract with Bayern, though, and there has been a host of speculation surrounding his future over the last few months. Tottenham Hotspur have been linked with the Germany international, while Arsenal are also believed to be considering making an attempt to bring him back to the club. According to Bild, Bayern have offered the attacker the chance to double his salary to a figure in the region of £14m. The proposed new deal would place the German alongside Kingsley Coman and Leroy Sane in terms of the highest earners at Allianz Arena, but Gnabry allegedly does not view the wage packet as a priority. © Reuters The report claims that the forward does not currently feel valued by Bayern and is unsure whether he will be a key player for the club moving forward. Gnabry initially joined Arsenal from Stuttgart in 2011 but failed to become a first-team regular for the club, only making 18 appearances in all competitions before leaving for Werder Bremen. An impressive spell in Bremen led to Bayern signing him in 2017, and he has scored 63 goals and registered 40 assists in 169 appearances for the Munich giants during a successful spell. Arsenal could reportedly press ahead with a move for Gnabry if they manage to secure a top-four spot in the Premier League, which would bring Champions League football for next season. The Gunners are believed to be preparing a busy summer window, with a deal for Manchester City's Gabriel Jesus already allegedly agreed, as both Eddie Nketiah and Alexandre Lacazette could leave on free transfers, while the futures of a number of other players are in question. © Reuters Tottenham boss Antonio Conte, meanwhile, has reportedly told the North London club that he needs six new players during this summer's transfer window in order to compete next term. Spurs are also said to be admirers of Gnabry, with a recent report claiming that the club were planning to make an approach during this summer's transfer window. Arsenal and Tottenham are currently battling for fourth spot in the Premier League table, with the former two points ahead of their capital rivals on the same number of games (33). Real Madrid have also been credited with an interest in Gnabry, although the Spanish giants are thought to have other priorities, including Paris Saint-Germain's Kylian Mbappe.  ",negative,arsenal,4

Chelsea have led the way, spending more than £200million in recent months, but United's only capture, to the chagrin of their army of supporters, has been Dutch midfielder Donny Van De Beek from Ajax. Edinson Cavani is highly likely to bolster Manchester United's forward line (Andrew Milligan/PA) Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has once again had to bear the brunt of criticism with United so far unable to strike deals for forward pair Jadon Sancho and Ousmane Dembele from Borussia Dortmund and Barcelona respectively.  Dortmund's 120m euros (£108m) asking price for Sancho has been a key issue in recent months while sporting director Michael Zorc told reporters on Saturday that ""the door is closed"", which seems to bring an end to speculation.  United are highly likely to strengthen their forward line with the capture of veteran Uruguayan Edinson Cavani following his release by Paris St Germain, but other areas of concern for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer may go unaddressed.  They had been linked with Gareth Bale before he ultimately plumped for a return to Spurs, where Alli seems to be surplus to requirements having not played in the top flight since their season-opening defeat to Everton.  PSG have already had one offer rejected and have been tipped to make a follow-up loan bid for the 24-year-old, who has been left out of Gareth Southgate's England squad for the fixtures against Wales, Belgium and Denmark. Dele Alli was not included in England's latest squad for their three fixtures in October (Jonathan Brady/PA) Arsenal could raid Chelsea for the second time this summer. Having signed Willian on a free transfer, Gunners boss Mikel Arteta is out to boost his midfield options and Jorginho is reported to fit the bill.  Even though Frank Lampard has strengthened in the middle of the park by signing Hakim Ziyech and Kai Havertz – with Ben Chilwell, Edouard Mendy and Timo Werner also joining in big-money moves – the Blues head coach may be reluctant to let go of a player who has twice captained the side this season.  Manchester City's stuttering start to the campaign might see them make a late foray into the transfer market for a new left-back, with Bayern Munich's David Alaba and Ajax's Nicolas Tagliafico among those being apparently courted.  Champions Liverpool are rumoured to be eyeing a last-gasp swoop for Dembele but having added Diogo Jota, Thiago Alcantara and Kostas Tsimikas to their ranks, Jurgen Klopp is probably satisfied with his lot.  Merseyside rivals Everton are bracing themselves for bids for Moise Kean, allegedly attracting interest from PSG and former club Juventus, but his departure could pave the way for Arkadiusz Milik to join the Toffees from Napoli. Sean Dyche's Burnley are yet to record a point in the Premier League this season (Martin Rickett/PA) Leeds, who have made a whirlwind start in their first top-flight campaign in 16 years, are supposed to be closing in on Rennes winger Raphinha while Norwich's Todd Cantwell is also a priority for the Elland Road club.  Burnley, without a point from their opening four matches, have seen Jeff Hendrick, Aaron Lennon and Joe Hart all leave Turf Moor and their only outfield signing so far has been Dale Stephens from Brighton.

Arsenal have been strongly linked with the Brazil international in recent weeks, as the Gunners prepare to lose both Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah on free transfers this summer. According to TodoFichajes, Mikel Arteta's side have already reached an agreement with the Premier League champions for the acquisition of Jesus. The report claims that the Gunners are set to pay in the region of €50m (£42m) for the South American, with Man City putting that figure towards a deal for Haaland.

A new central midfielder could also be on the agenda for Arsenal with Mohamed Elneny now less than two months away from becoming a free agent, but the Egypt international has impressed with showings against Chelsea and Manchester United in the past couple of weeks. © Reuters Elneny has confirmed his desire to sign a new contract at Arsenal, even if he remains a bit-part player under Arteta, who has also admitted that the ex-Basel man does not always get the credit he feels he deserves. Kieran Tierney's long-term injury and Nuno Tavares's hit-and-miss campaign could also lead Arsenal to move for a new left-back in the summer market, and Bologna's Aaron Hickey is also thought to be on their wanted list. However, the Scottish teenager - who supposedly possesses a €20m (£16.7m) price tag - is also rumoured to have attracted interest from Italian heavyweights Juventus, AC Milan and Napoli ahead of the summer window.

The quadruple-chasing Reds travel to eastern Spain holding a commanding 2-0 lead in their last-four tie after a Pervis Estupinan own goal and Sadio Mane’s second-half effort in a one-sided first leg at Anfield last week. However, manager Jurgen Klopp is not taking anything for granted on the road to Paris, insisting it is a difficult scoreline as Unai Emery pledged to make his side “suffer” in Tuesday’s return clash. Liverpool followed up that dominant win over Villarreal in which they held 73 per cent of the overall possession and allowed only one shot (which was off-target) by triumphing at Newcastle on Saturday, with Naby Keita’s fourth goal of the season in the early Premier League kick-off ensuring they piled the pressure on title rivals Manchester City, who responded with a routine 3-0 victory at Leeds later in the day to regain top spot with four games to go. Much-changed Villarreal, meanwhile, slumped to a disappointing 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Alaves at the weekend, leaving them seventh in LaLiga, four points adrift of the top six and nine behind Atletico Madrid in fourth. Their hopes of playing in Europe at all next season could well now rest on pulling off an incredible comeback against six-time champions Liverpool and winning the whole competition, with either Real Madrid or Manchester City awaiting the winners of this tie in the final at the Stade de France on May 28.

Divock Origi will be assessed after missing the win over Newcastle through non-Covid illness, though Curtis Jones and Kostas Tsimikas are available again. Klopp made five changes in total at St James’ Park, with Mohamed Salah, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ibrahima Konate all moving to the bench.

Mo Salah will return to Liverpool’s starting XI against Villarreal after being rested at Newcastle Klopp is not expecting any players to miss out with a stomach bug that has been in camp of late. Villarreal boss Emery made eight changes of his own against Alaves, with only Samuel Chukwueze, Dani Parejo and Pau Torres retaining their starting berths from Anfield. Former Liverpool full-back Alberto Moreno remains sidelined with a long-term knee injury, but a major boost should come with the return of key striker Gerard Moreno, who sat out the first leg with a hamstring complaint. Raul Albiol and ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin have both shaken off knocks, though Arnaut Danjuma is now struggling with a foot problem after missing training on Monday.

Untroubled Liverpool were entirely comfortable and should unquestionably have won by more as they serenely controlled and dominated proceedings.

Spurs face a daunting trip to quadruple-chasing Liverpool on Saturday evening before Arsenal host Leeds, who have been dragged into the thick of a three-way relegation fight. With a two-point lead over their bitter rivals, fourth-placed Arsenal will be the more comfortable of the two, and this weekend offers them a good chance to open up a five-point gap on Spurs and potentially a cushion going into the north London derby at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Thursday week. But this is merely a scrap for fourth place, quite different to the relentless nature of the title race between Liverpool and Manchester City. Neither Arsenal nor Spurs have shown enough consistency this season to suggest they are certain to win their three other fixtures, so there should be more twists to come. If Spurs have an X-factor, it is their world-class individuals. In head coach Antonio Conte, they have one of the game’s best, while Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester was made comfortable by the brilliance of Harry Kane, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski at one end and Cristian Romero at the other. Arsenal, by contrast, are lacking the same star quality but feel like a more rounded team under Mikel Arteta, further along in their rebuild than their neighbours. Last month, Brighton and Brentford offered a blueprint of how to nullify Conte’s Spurs — specifically, deny them space in the final third and stop Kane getting on the ball — and, in having a more clearly-defined system, Arsenal are harder to stop and better at breaking down stubborn opponents. Arteta is also getting more from his squad than Conte, and important performances from fringe players Mohamed Elneny, Eddie Nketiah and Rob Holding in the wins over Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham point to a united group, with deceptive depth. By contrast, Lucas Moura was hopelessly rusty on his first Spurs start since mid-February on Sunday, while Harry Winks was off the pace in a late cameo, hardly surprisingly given Conte has barely changed his XI for over two months. Both clubs have been impacted by injuries in the same positions, with Spurs losing midfielder Oliver Skipp and wing-back Matt Doherty, and Arsenal without Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney in similar positions. Mikel Arteta vs Antonio Conte - who will win the race for Champions League qualification? The absences may prove crucial in the run-in. In Nuno Tavares, who is deputising for Tierney at left wing-back, Arsenal have an agent of chaos, and while the Portuguese is in the team there is a chance they will drop points in any game. Kulusevski, who came off the bench to twice assist Son on Sunday, should have the beating of Tavares if they both start on May 12. For all their star quality up front, Spurs, though, are weak on both flanks. In the absence of Doherty and Sergio Reguilon, who is sidelined indefinitely with a groin injury, wing-backs Emerson Royal and Ryan Sessegnon failed to make an impact in the final third against Leicester. But it is long past the point where Conte is likely to change his system or experiment on the flanks. If Arsenal allow Spurs’ wing-backs to have the ball, and keep it away from their forwards, they will be in a strong position next week. Spurs finish the season against Burnley, who are likely to be fighting for survival, and already-relegated Norwich, while Arsenal face a tough trip to Newcastle and host Everton on the final day, when the Toffees may also be playing for their Premier League status. The derby will surely be crucial, but the fight for Champions League football could come down to Spurs’ individual brilliance against Arsenal’s collective cohesion and unity. Whatever happens in the next fortnight, expect the contest to go the wire. ",positive,arsenal,11

The Hammers are heading to Germany on Thursday for the second leg of their semi-final tie after losing the first match in London 2-1 last week. West Ham are no strangers to being in this position during the Europa League as they lost the first leg of their last-16 tie to Sevilla, while Lyon held them to a draw at home in the quarter-finals. David Moyes’ side turned both ties around, though, by winning the second legs in convincing fashion without conceding a goal and Soucek thinks that will fill the team with belief ahead of the trip to Frankfurt. “This is a good way [to think] as we won both the other games in the second leg,” he told Standard Sport. “We need to do it again now. It gives confidence to us and we know that we can be a better team on Thursday, because we already played against them and we are quite confident. Tomas Soucek is confident West Ham can turn around their Europa League semi-final deficit against Eintracht Frankfurt “But we have to do 100 per cent of us, or maybe more, during the game. We have been showing spirit all season, maybe for two years since Covid started. We have developed a great atmosphere and on Thursday we will need it even more, because it is so difficult but so close to the final. “Our spirit has to be incredible from the first second, because we know what happened in the first leg, we conceded in 40 seconds. From the first second we have to be ready.” West Ham have enjoyed a remarkable run in Europe this season and although defeat to Arsenal on Sunday means they can no longer qualify for the Champions League via the Premier League, they can still do so by winning the Europa League. Soucek has admitted it would be a dream to play in the Champions League and only adds to the potential prize on offer. “It’s one thing to get to the final, to be so close to get to the trophy of the Europa League and get a medal,” he said. “The second thing is to get into the Champions League. They are two big things that we want, but it is still a really difficult step to go in the second leg.” ",positive,arsenal,1

The rivals are set to go head to head a week on Thursday (May 12) in a match that is being billed as one of the biggest north London derbies in recent history. Holding admits the Arsenal squad are well aware that game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium will have a huge say on who qualifies for the Champions League, but the centre-back has also urged his team-mates not to allow it to distract them as Leeds visit the Emirates on Sunday. “We have got to take it a game at a time,” Holding told Standard Sport, when asked about the north London derby. “Obviously we have got Leeds at the weekend and that’s always an intense game. “They come and bring energy. It will be a tough game, but we are at home with the fans behind us and we can try to chalk up another three points. Rob Holding has warned Arsenal not to look past Leeds with a crucial north London derby looming “Then the following week on the Thursday we have Tottenham, so that’s what it’ll come down to and it should be a good game.” Arsenal and Tottenham have been neck and neck in the top-four race, and they momentarily swapped places on Sunday after Spurs beat Leicester in the early kick-off. The Gunners responded by defeating West Ham and have now won three games on the spin after initially losing the same number of matches at the start of April. Those wins have come against Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham, with Holding partly putting the turnaround down to Arsenal supporters sticking by the team during a difficult spell. “I think since Mikel [Arteta] has come in there has been a big change in mentality and connecting with the fans,” he said. “I think on Sunday the fans were amazing again and they have been for the last couple of weeks, in terms of away games and at home. “That’s why our results have been decent since those three that we lost. We bounced back and they stuck by us. It could have been an easy point to turn on us, but they stuck by us and we’ve had three good results now.” ",negative,arsenal,6

He wants ministers to use the money to help to build more than 1,000 artificial pitches, improve 20,000 playing surfaces and invest in changing rooms. Dein wrote: “While, to date, the focus has been on the buyers, there is a crucial question of where the proceeds from the sale go. Without question, the victims of the war in Ukraine should be central in our thoughts and anything we can do to use this sale money to support humanitarian efforts should be welcomed."" But he added: ""Investment in coaching, pitches, academies and facilities in deprived and left-behind areas could be game-changing for communities and young people. ""It could help to create a new generation of English football stars while also supporting community cohesion, new jobs, reducing youth crime and helping grow and develop girls' and women's football. These are all cross-government priorities and I hope that Her Majesty's government maybe able to work together to create a game-changing opportunity."" ",positive,arsenal,1
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/ryan-sessegnon-harry-kane-heung-min-son-antonio-conte-future-tottenham-premier-league-2022-b997512.html,Tottenham: Ryan Sessegnon hails Heung-min Son and Harry Kane as ‘world class’ in praise of prolific teammates,"ottenham’s Heung-min Son is one of the best players in the world but still underrated in the game, according to teammate Ryan Sessegnon. Son reached 19 goals for the season with a clinical double in Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester, making him the outright top scorer from open play in the Premier League and behind only Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah -- on 22 -- in the race for the Golden Boot. Both of Son’s goals came with his supposedly weaker left foot, including a stunning effort into the top corner to make it 3-0, and he also assisted Harry Kane’s opener with a corner. Kane is widely regarded as one of the best forwards in the world but Son is often overlooked in debates about the league’s best marksmen, despite his consistency. Asked about the front five of next weekend’s opponents Liverpool, Sessegnon said he would not swap Kane or Son for anyone and believes the latter is underrated on account of his character. Asked if Son is one of the best in the world, Sessegnon said: ""100 per cent. He has been consistent over the last six or seven years, doing it at the top level and the numbers speak for themselves. ""It’s hard to know why he is underrated because consistently, season after season, his numbers are there. I think it’s because he’s such a down-to-earth, normal guy. He’s not an arrogant person and he’s just very friendly with everyone. That’s probably why [he is underrated]. ""Of course, [Son and Kane] make it much easier for us. They can do special things on the ball and you saw that again on Sunday. Sonny assisted H again and their combination they’ve had ever since playing together is unbelievable. ""No way [would we swap them]. The two players we have [up front] are world class and we wouldn’t swap them for anyone."" Sessegnon’s Spurs career has been revived under Antonio Conte and he is hoping the head coach remains at the club next season, despite his consistent refusals to commit beyond the end of the current campaign. The wing-back insists the speculation over Conte’s future is not a distraction for the squad and says the Italian is helping to restore his confidence after a succession of hamstring injuries. ""Is the speculation unsettling? Not really, not at all,"" Sessegnon said. ""We’re professionals and we focus on our game and step by step. You heard him yourself, [the speculation is] obviously false news, he’s focusing on here at the club. As players we’re just focusing on our job going forward and that’s all we can do. ""Of course I hope he stays, he’s a top manager and he’s shown that with us this season. We hope he’s here next season and for us the main objective is to get in that top four and then prepare for next season. ""It has not been easy [for me] since I’ve been at the club, but step by step he gives me confidence in every game to go and do what I can do,"" Sessegnon added. ""For me it’s about believing in myself and getting in that positive run, feeling good and keep pushing. ""Every day, every game as well learning bit by bit, the defensive side, the attacking side. Of course he’s very demanding and [as a wing-back] you need to be up and down. You almost have to manage yourself when to go, when to relax a little bit, but it is relentless."" Asked if he now has confidence in his body to remain injury-free, the 21-year-old added: ""Definitely. At times it is quite hard, it’s a mental battle with the physical side as well. Right now I feel good and I’m giving 100 per cent every time I’m out there."" Arsenal’s win at West Ham later on Sunday means Spurs remain two points behind their fourth-placed rivals and need to beat quadruple-chasing Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday to guarantee they will be within touching distance of their neighbours in next week’s potentially crucial north London derby. Sessegnon impressed in the 2-2 draw with Jurgen Klopp’s side in December and says both the team and himself can take confidence from that performance. ""We’ll look at the game and see the positives and take those positives into the next game at Anfield,"" he said. ""We know it’s a different stage of the season and we have to manage it. But again when we have the chances to score, we should take those chances. ""I think every game I play in this team gives me confidence to go and do what I want to do on the pitch, especially against the big teams as I played well in the last game when they came here. It’ll be no different going into that game."" ",positive,arsenal,1

The Blues slumped to a dismal 1-0 defeat by relegation battlers managed by Frank Lampard at Goodison Park on Sunday after captain Cesar Azpilicueta inexplicably lost the ball to Richarlison, who promptly slotted home what proved to be the winning goal just after half-time. Chelsea were then thwarted by a combination of their own profligacy, the woodwork and an outstanding display from England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford as Everton picked up a vital three points in their fight against relegation from the Premier League and their opponents were left to rue another self-inflicted disappointment. Manager Thomas Tuchel lamented his side’s sudden penchant for critical mistakes, which also cost them against Arsenal last week and in their agonising Champions League quarter-final defeat by Real Madrid. Loftus-Cheek was one of the few Chelsea players to come out of the defeat on Merseyside with any credit, denied a goal by the excellent Pickford and trying to drive his team forward whenever possible on his 50th start for the club. Ruben Loftus-Cheek was one of Chelsea’s few bright lights in their dismal defeat at Everton “We’re all very disappointed,” the 26-year-old told Chelsea’s official website. “Coming into the game we knew it was going to be a hostile atmosphere and it’d be like a final to them. We felt that straight away. “They came out of the blocks second half and caught us napping. We were fighting an uphill battle from then on, the fans were behind them, and it was hard to break them down. It was disappointing. “We’ve made a few mistakes over the past few matches and haven’t kept clean sheets from individual errors. That is how football is, if you keep shooting yourselves in the foot it will be difficult to get out of it.” Chelsea will be desperate to iron out those blunders before they face in-form Liverpool in a domestic cup final for the second time this season at Wembley on May 14. A third defeat in six Premier League games has also loosened their grip further on third place, with resurgent Arsenal now just three points behind and Tottenham five adrift of Chelsea with four matches left to play this term. Asked how Tuchel’s side could go about eradicating those repeated errors, Loftus-Cheek added: “It’s up to us as individuals to tune in and sharpen up as a team together. Getting everyone ready for the game, these are basics in football. “If you don’t have these basics, you will struggle like we have the last four games. This is not Chelsea standard at all. Our concentration levels were not good enough. “We want top four but we cannot perform like that with other teams doing well around us. We need wins. It is hard to process it right now and we will look back at it once the emotions have calmed down. “We had chances to score numerous times. Their keeper made some great saves. If we put them in, I think we could be coming away with a win.” ",positive,arsenal,2
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-fc-romelu-lukaku-everton-thomas-tuchel-b997473.html,Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel reveals why Romelu Lukaku did not play at all in shock Everton defeat,"helsea manager Thomas Tuchel has opened up on his decision not to play Romelu Lukaku at all during Sunday’s shock defeat by Everton. The sluggish and weary Blues suffered their third loss in six Premier League games at Goodison Park, with Richarlison’s effort after a key Cesar Azpilicueta error handing Frank Lampard’s side a vital victory in their battle against relegation. It was a disappointing result punctuated by more sloppy individual mistakes and profligacy, both of which are becoming all-too-familiar themes for a Chelsea team that have certainly not been firing on all cylinders since their agonising Champions League quarter-final exit at the hands of Real Madrid last month. Lukaku’s struggles are a major running theme of an inconsistent campaign that has still included two domestic cup finals and Club World Cup glory, with the £97.5million club-record signing having started just one of the last nine matches across all competitions. Prolific in Inter Milan’s Serie A title-winning season last year, the Belgian international has failed to net a Premier League goal since December. Romelu Lukaku was an unused substitute as Chelsea slumped to a shock defeat at Everton Regardless of those ongoing issues, many fans may still have expected Tuchel to turn to Lukaku as his side tried in vain to snatch a late equaliser on Merseyside on Sunday, with third-place Chelsea now just three points ahead of Arsenal with four matches left to play this term. Instead, the German opted to replace Jorginho with midfield colleague Mateo Kovacic at the interval, with wide forwards Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic later introduced at the expense of captain Azpilicueta and ineffective frontman Timo Werner. When quizzed as to why Lukaku did not feature at all against former club Everton, Tuchel insisted he was merely restricted by the number of available substitutions, which will be increased to five per game from next season. He said: “Because we brought Jorginho off. We only had three changes.” ",negative,arsenal,1
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-rob-holding-mikel-arteta-mohamed-elneny-b997441.html,Arsenal: Unlikely heroes emerge as Mikel Arteta’s young side regain control of Champions League battle,"or much of Arsenal’s season their young players have been centre stage, but this recent revival has seen other unlikely protagonists step forward. After losing to Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton, few would have predicted Arsenal would then beat Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham in quick succession. Nor would many have called that the likes of Eddie Nketiah and Mohamed Elneny would be at the heart of those wins. Against West Ham, it was the turn of Rob Holding to emerge as an unlikely hero as he helped Arsenal battle to a 2-1 win. It was not a great performance from the Gunners and even manager Mikel Arteta described it as “ugly”, but they dug deep to grind out the result and no one embodied that gritty effort more than Holding. The centre-back has been on the periphery this season, playing second fiddle to Ben White and Gabriel and essentially taking on the role of defensive super-sub when Arsenal need to see out a game. ‘Smash glass here in case of emergency’, more or less. For this trip to West Ham, however, Holding was given the chance to start due to White being out injured with a tight hamstring. Holding seized his chance, opening the scoring with a header from a corner before throwing his body on the line as Arsenal held on to their slender lead. “The contribution that he (Holding) is having in terms of minutes is not very noticeable, but the contribution he has for the team is huge,” said Arteta. “He needs some praise. “He is someone like Mo [Elneny]. He is the same type of character, same type of person, that is just humble, just wants to give to the team and is happy with the success. When you ask him to play, he is always ready to do it.” It says a lot about the spirit at Arsenal that Holding and Elneny have barely played this season, but have come in and contributed at the most crucial time. Rob Holding and Mohamed Elneny remain crucial for Arsenal despite a lack of regular games Keeping players happy has not always been easy for Arteta but, even if this slimmed down squad has caused him problems, it has also allowed him to create a greater sense of unity. Holding has played his part in that and it is telling that he is a member of the leadership group, despite not being a regular starter. Off the pitch he has a strong influence in the dressing room and is valued by Arteta, acting as one of his trusted lieutenants. Having a strong first XI is naturally crucial to success, but the role of the squad cannot be overlooked and it has caused issues in the past at Arsenal. Holding’s goal and defensive efforts were pivotal in sealing an important win at West Ham The dressing room has not always been the happiest of places, however it is noticeable now how those on the sidelines seem fully on board, even if they only have limited chances to play. “It’s what it’s been like, Ben and Gabi have been great all year and when I’ve had to come on and try and help us secure the three points it’s vital for us, so to play the full 90 and get the three points is even better,” said Holding. Arsenal’s squad clearly needs strengthening and depth added, but, like last summer, making sure the right characters are signed will be key. In Holding, Arteta has someone who emphatically ticks that box. ",positive,arsenal,9

The striker started for the fourth successive match on Sunday, playing a pivotal role as Mikel Arteta’s resurgent side swiftly regained fourth place in the Premier League from rivals Tottenham with a hard-fought 2-1 win at the London Stadium. Along with the likes of Mohamed Elneny and Rob Holding, Nketiah is one of a number of unlikely protagonists now contributing hugely to Arsenal’s push for Champions League qualification despite a previous lack of regular playing opportunities. The 22-year-old’s Arsenal future remains subject to significant doubt, however, with his contract due to expire in June and no agreement yet reached over an extension despite offers having been tabled over recent months. The loss of Nketiah would likely leave Mikel Arteta needing to sign at least two new forwards this summer, with Alexandre Lacazette also seeing his deal expire and admitting he is open to returning to Lyon after holding talks with plenty of clubs. Eddie Nketiah has become an influential part of Arsenal’s push for a Champions League berth And Souness says he is “amazed” by the Arsenal academy graduate’s contract situation, believing he won’t be short of suitors on a potential free transfer after another impressive outing at West Ham. “I thought Nketiah was the best player on the pitch against West Ham,” Souness said on Sky Sports. “He was always threatening. “His contract is about to run out? I’m amazed by that. He will not be short of teams wanting him. He looked a threat throughout and he’s up for the fight. “I really like him and against West Ham, I thought he was fabulous. He’s put himself in the shop window. If that is his general standard, he will not be short of teams wanting to take him.” ",positive,arsenal,5

Rob Holding opened the scoring in the first-half by heading home from a corner, but West Ham equalised before the break through Jarrod Bowen. The Gunners, however, scored the winner in the second-half as Gabriel headed home at the back post from Gabriel Martinelli’s cross. Simon Collings was at the London Stadium to see Arsenal in action... Aaron Ramsdale 6 Made an excellent save in the first-half when Declan Rice’s header looked destined to go in.

Strong in the air and dealt well with Said Benrahma Rob Holding 8 | Star man Into the side for the injured Ben White and had a good game. Opened the scoring with an excellent header and made some vital blocks at the other end. Gabriel 7 Didn’t have a great first-half and looked shaky at times. Improved after the break and got on the scoresheet with a good header. Nuno 5 Just looks so raw and a player clearly still developing. Had some bright moments going forward, but defensively he looks vulnerable. Martin Odegaard 6 Was the best player on the pitch for this game last season, but he was very quiet today. Struggled to get into the game as Rice kept him quiet. Mohamed Elneny 7 Another good performance from the Egyptian, who is relishing his run in the team. Made one or two crucial blocks and tackles. Granit Xhaka 7 The Swiss has been in fine form recently, but he was not quite at his best today. He was still solid enough, especially defensively, but a few loose passes at times.

Harry Kane’s goal and a Heung-min Son double ensured Spurs moved above their north London neighbours, at least temporarily, with the Gunners due to play West Ham later in the day. A much-changed Leicester, who are prioritising Thursday’s Conference League semi-final decider against Roma, struck the post early on through Patson Daka but were undone when Kane header home Son’s corner in the first half. After the break, South Korean finished inside the box from substitute Dejan Kulusevski’s pass before curling home a stunning effort from 20 yards to seal an important victory. Kelechi Iheanacho bagged a late consolation for Leicester when his long-range effort range crept inside the near post. Dan Kilpatrick was at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to rate the Spurs players... Hugo Lloris 7 Made a fine fingertip save to turn Daka’s early effort on to the post and quick off his line when needed. Couldn’t keep out Iheanacho’s late strike, which was right in the corner. Cristian Romero 9 A presence at both ends of the pitch in another imposing display. Made the second goal with a magnificent double tackle, the second absolutely cleaning out Caglar Soyuncu. Eric Dier 8 Won some important headers in a calm performance. Coped well with sub Jamie Vardy for the final 25 minutes. Ben Davies 7 Gifted Leicester an early chance in a sloppy moment but solid thereafter. Stepped out of defence well on a couple of occasions. Emerson Royal 5 Tidy and worked hard but failed to make any impact in the final third. He was involved in the build up to Son’s second goal, however. Rodrigo Bentancur 7 Passing was hit and miss, but got struck in and helped Spurs to establish midfield dominance after the interval. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg 7 Used the ball well and was one of Spurs’ better players in the first half, despite a mix-up with Romero leading to Daka’s chance. Might have been clear on goal from Kulusevski’s pass but touch was poor. Ryan Sessegnon 6 Got in some good positions but struggled to make inroads against his opposite man in another difficult outing. Still looked short of confidence. Lucas Moura 4 Back in the XI for the first time since the defeat to Wolves in mid-February, he did nothing to suggest he has deserved more playing time. Never got going and was more liability than threat. Heung-min Son 9 Made the game safe with two second half goals, including a stunning curling finish. Assisted Kane with a near-post corner in a match-winning display. Harry Kane 7 Continued his remarkable record against Leicester with an 18th goal in 17 appearances, a firm header from Son’s corner. Subs Dejan Kulusevski (Lucas 55’) 8 Responded to being rested with an immediate impact from the bench, slipping in Son to double the scoring and setting up his second goal with a simple pass. Harry Winks (Bentancur 81’) 4 Beaten too easily by Iheanacho in the build up to Leicester’s goal. Steven Bergwijn (Son 81’) 6 No repeat of his late heroics at the King Power in a brief cameo.

Saka, meanwhile, was brought off for Emile Smith Rowe for the final few minutes at the London Stadium and looked to be in some discomfort in the closing stages. Ben White missed the game with a tight hamstring, although it is hoped his problem is not serious. Arteta, who has already lost Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey to injury problems during the run-in, provided a positive update on his players after the game. “Ben got injured against Manchester United, he felt a muscular problem and we checked him, and we will have to assess him in the next few days to see how he is,” he said. “Bukayo was fine, he was really fatigued and he has been through a little injury as well.

Minutes before Gabriel headed in what proved to be a winner, the Arsenal goalkeeper rushed out to sweep up a long-ball played in-behind his defence, to which Bowen got to first. The West Ham star hit the ground after a collision but was booked for diving, although Ramsdale would give him credit during his post-match interview for not protesting further. “He is a good lad,” said the Arsenal stopper. “I didn’t actually touch him at all. He was honest. He jumped straight back up and said, ‘No, no, no. It wasn’t a foul’. Fair play to him.” Moyes, however, suggested there may well have been a chance for Bowen to cause Ramsdale a problem without diving necessarily. “I don’t ever want my players to dive because I just don’t really believe in it,” he said. “I think Jarrod could have easily left his leg there and trailing it into the goalkeeper, maybe he should have. ""It was a reckless challenge by the goalkeeper. The only thing that went for him was it was classed as no contact."" Moyes would also lament some of the decisions that went against his side. “We did a good job against a good team but ultimately we got done on set pieces. We are normally very good on them. “Do you think Holding on the second one heads it with his arm first of all? It looks as if it hits his arm, I don’t think he heads it. That would have been in the same phase of play wouldn’t it? It hits his arm. “They [VAR] can get it wrong sometimes as well, they have got it wrong a lot of times. I might be wrong.” ",positive,arsenal,3

Tottenham’s win over Leicester earlier in the day had piled the pressure on Arteta’s side, who kicked-off in fifth place and without key defender Ben White, who missed out with a tight hamstring. In as his replacement, Holding scored the first Premier League goal of his career when he glanced in an opener just after the half-hour mark before Jarrod Bowen’s equaliser. Gabriel would then score a second header as Arsenal saw the game out, moving back above Spurs in a tight Champions League battle. It was another impressive performance from Holding in particular, his second in quick-succession after playing a crucial role in the 4-2 win at Chelsea last month, a result that got Arsenal moving back up the table following a run of three consecutive losses. After the game, Arteta told Sky Sports: “We showed incredible spirit because when we could play the way we wanted to play we had to find a way to play the way they prefer. We adapted. You have to find a way to win all the time to win - forcing mistakes, being brilliant, digging in, clean sheets. “I am really happy, especially for Rob Holding as he hasn’t played the amount of minutes he deserves. He was man of the match today. He is always there when we need him.” ",positive,arsenal,3

Arsenal ensured they ended gameweek 35 in the Premier League’s top four with a 2-1 win away at West Ham at the London stadium on Sunday. The Gunners had been knocked out of the last Champions League qualification spot by north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur earlier on Sunday after they beat Leicester City. But Arsenal responded to the pressure with a third consecutive victory to give them the edge in what has become a two-horse race for fourth place. After a cagey opening to the contest in which Arsenal enjoyed most of the possession, Rob Holding gave the visitors the lead with a glancing header from a 38th-minute corner. West Ham levelled on the stroke of halftime, however, with Jarrod Bowen’s shot taking a deflection to beat Aaron Ramsdale who moments earlier had saved well from Declan Rice. Gabriel ensured Arsenal remained in the driving seat for a long-awaited return to the Champions League although, with a north London derby still to come, the race is far from over. Arsenal have 63 points from 34 games with Tottenham on 61 points, also with four games left to play.

Hammers boss David Moyes rested players for Thursday’s Europa League, with the likes of Michail Antonio left on the bench. They still gave Arsenal a good game, though, and they went in level at the break as Jarrod Bowen cancelled out Rob Holding’s opener. Gabriel, however, scored a winner for Arsenal in the second-half and West Ham are now sixth in the Premier League, with the Gunners 11 points ahead of them with three games to go. Simon Collings was at the London Stadium to see West Ham in action... Lukasz Fabianski 7 Made one or two good saves to deny Eddie Nketiah and Bukayo Saka. Couldn’t do much about either goal, as poor marking let him down. Vladimir Coufal 7 As always, he was a real threat going forward and caused Nuno problems at left-back. Setup Bowen’s goal with a good cross. Kurt Zouma 6 Not at his best and still looks to be finding his feet after returning from injury. Was caught out once or twice by Nketiah’s pace. Aaron Cresswell 6 Asked to fill in at centre-back and did a solid job, especially given he was playing in a two and not a back-three. Ryan Fredericks 5 Had a tough afternoon up against Saka, who skipped past him a few times. Not easy for Fredericks given he had been asked to fill in at left-back.. Mark Noble 6 Unsurprisingly outshone by Rice next to him, who was imperious. Looked a bit leggy at times and occasionally struggled with pace of play. Declan Rice 7 | Star man Another excellent performance in the middle of the park from the England international. Looks a class above every week he plays. Pablo Fornals 6 Like most of the trio behind Bowen, the Spaniard couldn’t really get into the game too much. Had a few sights of goal in second-half. Manuel Lanzini 5 A difficult afternoon for the No10, who never really got going and was hooked with 20 minutes to go. Looked like his poor marking was partly to blame for Arsenal’s opener. Said Benrahma 5 Like Fornals on the other side, he just wasn’t really involved much. Kept quiet for most of the game by Takehiro Tomiyasu.

After a dull opening half an hour, Rob Holding – who once again impressed - scored the first Premier League goal of his career with a glancing header following Bukayo Saka’s corner. From there, the game burst into life. Seconds after Holding’s opener, Aaron Ramsdale pulled off a brilliant reactionary save as Declan Rice’s near-post flick-on flew towards him at break-neck speed. As is becoming customary for this West Ham side, David Moyes’ team were able to feed off a loud home crowd and create their own momentum, with Vladimir Coufal teeing up Jarrod Bowen for an improvised finish to level the scores just before the interval. After the break, the home side started brightly once more. Bowen proved the livewire in the absence of a central striker, although was booked for diving when Ramsdale raced out of his box to sweep up a long ball in-behind the Arsenal defence. With the game finely-poised, a set-piece was likely to be the difference and so it proved when Gabriel Martinelli crossed for compatriot Gabriel Magalhaes to power in what proved to be the winner ten minutes into the second-half. With a corner cleared, Martinelli reacted first and hung up an inviting cross for his teammate to convert with a crushing header at the back post. Eddie Nketiah twice went close to adding a third but this was a game in which Arteta’s side overcame a major hurdle. With Spurs beating Leicester earlier in the day, Arsenal proved they could deal with the pressure. ",positive,arsenal,3
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/antonio-conte-heung-min-son-tottenham-leicester-b997419.html,Antonio Conte hails ‘fantastic’ Heung-min Son after match-winning display against Leicester,"ntonio Conte praised “fantastic” Heung-min Son after the forward scored twice in Tottenham’s 3-1 win over Leicester - but warned that individual quality will count for little if his side do not finish in the top four. Spurs moved back ahead of Arsenal, albeit possibly temporarily, after Son scored twice in the second half, including a stunning effort into the top corner, against a much-changed Leicester. The South Korean’s first-half corner was headed home by Harry Kane — his 18th goal in 17 appearances against his former loan club — and he twice finished passes from substitute Dejan Kulusevski after the break. Kelechi Iheanacho scored a stoppage-time consolation for the Foxes, who made eight changes ahead of their visit to Roma for Thursday’s Europa Conference League semi-final decider. “I gave him a big hug because after an amazing goal my question was, ‘Which is his favourite foot, right or left?’” Conte said of Son, who scored both goals his his supposedly weaker left foot. “He scored a fantastic goal and three minutes before, when I spoke with him, I said, ‘Go for five or six minutes and then I have to make a change’. “So [after the game] I said to him, ‘You listened that I wanted to make a change and you decide to score this amazing goal!’ “We are talking about a great player, a fantastic player. “But it’s important at the end of the season to celebrate a big achievement with the team. Otherwise it remains only a personal success to score these types of goals.” Spurs moved a point clear of Arsenal, with Conte’s side facing Liverpool at Anfield next weekend and Arsenal playing Leeds, before they meet in a potentially decisive north London derby on May 12. Conte added: “It was a good performance against a really good team. “The game wasn’t easy and we knew very well that despite them making eight changes from the last game against Roma you can see the quality, you can see the squad that Leicester has. “For sure we got three points in an important moment of the season especially because in the next games we are going to face first Liverpool and then Arsenal. “Today it was vital to get three points. There is only one result and a lot of pressure, but I said to my players to live this moment, to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months. “I think no one at the start of the season could imagine Tottenham challenging for a place in the Champions League, especially in November when there was a change [of manager] and for this reason we have to be satisfied that we stay in this position to fight for a big achievement.” Conte also hailed Cristian Romero, who was imperious on the right of Spurs’ back three and helped create their all-important second goal - a close range finish from Son. The Argentine won the ball in a crunching 50-50 with Caglar Soyuncu before Kulusevski slipped in Son. “He played a good game,” the Spurs head coach said. “I think every single player played very well. For us it’s very important to do well with the whole team if we want to get three points. It’s no good to play with one, two or three players playing good. We need the whole team playing well and to find a good balance. When this happens we can win the game.” ",positive,arsenal,4
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/thomas-tuchel-chelsea-premier-league-top-four-b997416.html,Thomas Tuchel admits Chelsea are ‘never safe’ in top-four race after Everton defeat,"homas Tuchel claims Chelsea are now in a battle to secure top four after just two wins in their last six Premier League games. A 1-0 defeat to Everton continued their shaky end of season form and threatens to drag them back towards to Tottenham and Arsenal in the fight for Champions League places. Tuchel criticised his defence for another costly error that gifted Richarlison the winning goal just after half time. But it was a day when his attack let him down once again – even if it required the brilliance of Jordan Pickford to get Everton over the line. Tuchel said: “I said this many weeks ago that I didn’t feel safe and we are never safe. By the way, if we are in a race for top one, top two or top four, no matter what the race, the last four games to only have four points will never be enough, no matter which race we are in. “We have to take care about ourselves. At the moment we don’t get the points when we play well and deserve more and we lose when we play okay. This is a bad mixture.” Cesar Azpilicueta was caught in possession by Richarlison, who fired the winner at the start of the second half. Tuchel has seen his side dominate possession against Manchester United and Everton in the space of three days, yet his team have only managed one goal and one point from those games. He insists the issue is in defence, not attack. “We knew what was coming and like in the last matches we struggled to have clean sheets,” he said. “In the last four we had one, against West Ham, it is the only win we have and I’m very disappointed. “What can I do? The ball is free, give a goal away, it is the worst thing that can happen to you in this atmosphere. It happens too often. We struggle to play without big mistakes and it is why we struggle to have results.” On his attack he added: “If there is something I can do I will try it, but if I knew about it I would have done it before. “For me the key is to have a clean sheet. Manchester United was a different game. More open, fluid. We finally scored late and conceded straight away. “For me this is more like the game against West Ham and we had a clean sheet and played without any big mistakes and that gives us the chance to score late. “If you install emotion and belief in a stadium like this, you struggle.” Everton fans tried to put Chelsea off by setting off fireworks outside the Liverpool Hilton hotel where they stayed on Saturday night. Tuchel said they did not affect him. “I personally woke up twice at 1am and 3am for one minute and after the noise. I turned around and kept on sleeping.” ",positive,arsenal,1

For the majority of a scrappy game, there was little between Spurs and a much-changed Foxes, who are prioritising Thursday’s Europa Conference League decider against Roma, but the hosts’ individual quality told after the break, with Son scoring twice and Romero imperious at centre-half. The South Korean’s second goal was stunning curling effort from the edge of the box to make it 3-0, leaving Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg with his head in his hands, while Harry Kane showed flashes of brilliance and opened the scoring in the first half with his 19th goal in 18 appearances against Leicester. Kelechi Iheanacho scored a stoppage-time consolation for the visitors, who struck the post through Patson Daka at 0-0 but were undone by Son after Brendan Rodgers made eight chances ahead of the trip to Rome. This was not the most polished or convincing display from Antonio Conte’s side but, at this stage of this season, points are the only thing that matter and the win move Spurs one ahead of Arsenal, who face West Ham in the later kick-off. Kane predictability opened the scoring, making it 17 goals in 14 League games against his former loan club, while Son continued to prove that he does not need to be especially involved in games to be the most important player on the pitch. Romero, meanwhile, was outstanding, a class above in everything he did. The Argentine’s ferocious tackling set the tone for Spurs to kick-on in the second half and actually proved an attacking weapon in itself when he won the ball in the crunching challenge on Caglar Soyuncu in the build-up to Son’s all-important second goal. Dejan Kulusevski was also decisive, responding to being rested by coming off the bench and making both of Son’s goals, the first with a clever pass. But Son was really the star, moving ahead of Mohamed Salah for non-penalty goals this season, suggesting he still remains something of an underrated force. Rather than dominating matches, he is increasingly a clutch player in the final third, assisting or scoring when they need a jolt. He set Spurs on their way with a corner for Kane to stoop and score at the near post. If his first goal was a poacher’s finish inside the box, the second goal was inspired, as Son curled into the top corner with his left foot from 20 yards, leaving Kaspar Schmeichel with no chance. This win was an important reminder that while Spurs remain a work in progress under Conte, they have the individuals at both ends of the pitch to win any of their final four matches, even next weekend’s visit to Liverpool, when Kane and Son should relish the space behind the hosts’ high line. A frustration for Conte is that none of his stars had stepped up in the meek displays against Brighton and Brentford, although a Leicester side who are hard-wired to play on the front-foot were also likely to be a more attractive opponent for Conte’s side. While Arsenal are arguably a more well-rounded side than Spurs, further ahead in their development under Mikel Arteta, if this game is anything to go by, Spurs’ individual brilliance and world-class front two could be an important factor in the race for the Champions League.

After poor results against Brighton and Brentford, Spurs needed a response in their quest for Champions League football. It came in familiar fashion - Harry Kane headed them in front in the first-half, before Heung-min Son fired home his side’s second after the break. Son’s second, and Spurs’ third, came in stunning fashion, as the South Korean curled home a finish into the top corner from 20 yards to cap off a perfect afternoon for the hosts. Kelechi Iheanacho got the visitors on the scoresheet in the dying moments, but any hopes of a comeback had long since gone. It lifts Tottenham back into fourth place in the Premier League, though that will change if Arsenal come away from the London Stadium with three points later on Sunday. Spurs started the better of the two sides but it was a much-changed Leicester side who very nearly took the lead early on as Patson Daka was denied by the woodwork. Cristian Romero then had to make a brilliant interception to stop the Foxes striker having a tap-in at the back post. Despite that strong spell, it was Tottenham who found the opening goal of the match. The Foxes once again were found wanting defending a set-piece, as Son swung in the corner and Kane was there to head home. Spurs’ main man went close to getting his second of the afternoon as he pounced on a loose pass and poked an effort at goal, Kasper Schmeichel doing just about enough to keep it out. After a scrappy start to the second-half, Tottenham took real control of proceedings on the hour mark. Two huge challenges from Cristian Romero set them away, and Dejan Kulusevski then slid the ball through to Son. He turned smartly in the box and fired home with his left foot to double the advantage. Leicester never looked like mounting a comeback but any hopes of one were ended when Son got his second. He picked up the ball, cut inside onto his left and bent a stunning effort into the top corner to put the result beyond any doubt. Iheanacho added a late consolation in stoppage-time, but it did little to dampen the mood on a positive afternoon for Spurs in north London. ",positive,arsenal,1

The quadruple-chasing Reds travel to eastern Spain holding a commanding 2-0 lead in their last-four tie after a Pervis Estupinan own goal and Sadio Mane’s second-half effort in a one-sided first leg at Anfield last week. However, manager Jurgen Klopp is not taking anything for granted on the road to Paris, insisting it is a difficult scoreline as Unai Emery pledged to make his side “suffer” in Tuesday’s return clash. Liverpool followed up that dominant win over Villarreal in which they held 73 per cent of the overall possession and allowed only one shot (which was off-target) by triumphing at Newcastle on Saturday, with Naby Keita’s fourth goal of the season in the early Premier League kick-off ensuring they piled the pressure on title rivals Manchester City, who responded with a routine 3-0 victory at Leeds later in the day to regain top spot with four games to go. Much-changed Villarreal, meanwhile, slumped to a disappointing 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Alaves at the weekend, leaving them seventh in LaLiga, four points adrift of the top six and nine behind Atletico Madrid in fourth. Their hopes of playing in Europe at all next season could well now rest on pulling off an incredible comeback against six-time champions Liverpool and winning the whole competition, with either Real Madrid or Manchester City awaiting the winners of this tie in the final at the Stade de France on May 28. Liverpool vs Villarreal is scheduled for an 8pm BST kick-off on Tuesday May 3, 2022. The match will take place at the Estadio de la Ceramica - better known as El Madrigal - in Villarreal, Spain. TV channel: In the UK, the semi-final second leg will be televised live on BT Sport 2 and BT Sport Ultimate, with coverage beginning at 7pm. Live stream: Subscribers will also be able to watch the match online via the BT Sport website or app. Live blog: You can also follow all the action on the night via Standard Sport’s dedicated match blog. Liverpool will remain without Roberto Firmino on Tuesday, though the Brazilian forward is now back running after nursing a foot issue and is set to travel to Spain with his team-mates. Divock Origi will be assessed after missing the win over Newcastle through non-Covid illness, though Curtis Jones and Kostas Tsimikas are available again. Klopp made five changes in total at St James’ Park, with Mohamed Salah, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ibrahima Konate all moving to the bench. That quintet should return to the starting lineup against Villarreal, though it’s a difficult juggling act with Tottenham visiting Anfield on Saturday evening and the FA Cup Final against Chelsea now less than two weeks away. Mo Salah will return to Liverpool’s starting XI against Villarreal after being rested at Newcastle Klopp is not expecting any players to miss out with a stomach bug that has been in camp of late. Villarreal boss Emery made eight changes of his own against Alaves, with only Samuel Chukwueze, Dani Parejo and Pau Torres retaining their starting berths from Anfield. Former Liverpool full-back Alberto Moreno remains sidelined with a long-term knee injury, but a major boost should come with the return of key striker Gerard Moreno, who sat out the first leg with a hamstring complaint. Raul Albiol and ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin have both shaken off knocks, though Arnaut Danjuma is now struggling with a foot problem after missing training on Monday. Predicted Villarreal XI: Rulli, Foyth, Albiol, Torres, Estupinan, Parejo, Capoue, Coquelin, Lo Celso, Chukwueze, Gerard Predicted Liverpool XI: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Konate, Robertson; Fabinho, Henderson, Thiago; Mane, Salah, Diaz Villarreal’s gameplan totally failed at Anfield, with no shots on target, barely any possession and next to no opportunities to hit on the break. Untroubled Liverpool were entirely comfortable and should unquestionably have won by more as they serenely controlled and dominated proceedings. The wily Emery will have to make big tactical changes for the second leg as they need to put Liverpool under far more pressure from the outset. However, their chances of breaching a mean defence that have now kept four successive clean sheets across all competitions appear slim. Villarreal need to push on and take the initiative in front of their own fans, which will inevitably leave plenty of space in behind for the likes of Salah, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz to exploit. Liverpool to win, 2-0. Villarreal’s only win over Liverpool to date came on home soil back in the first leg of the Europa League semi-finals in 2016, with an injury-time effort from Adrian Lopez. However, the Reds hit back with goals from Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana at Anfield, winning 3-0 to book their place in the Basel showpiece, which they lost to Emery’s Sevilla.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-conte-levy-psg-b997258.html,Tottenham: Crunch talks with Daniel Levy still key to Antonio Conte’s future despite dismissing PSG rumours,"ntonio Conte has again refused to offer guarantees he will be at Tottenham next season, saying his future will only be decided after a meeting with the club at the end of the campaign. On Friday, Conte dismissed reports he had offered himself to Paris Saint-Germain as “fake news” and “lies”, and it was suggested to him at a later briefing that he could put an end to unwanted speculation over his future by committing to Spurs. But Conte reiterated that he was only focussed on the final five games of the season and would sit down with the club -- meaning chairman Daniel Levy and managing director Fabio Paratici -- to find “the best solution” after the visit to Norwich on May 22. The head coach effectively wants guarantees that Spurs can challenge at the top of the Premier League, saying he deserves “much more” than another scrap for fourth place next season, and suggested his future would depend on whether he has the patience to match the time needed to rebuild the squad. “As I said to [the media] a lot of times, at the end of the season we'll speak with the club but with pleasure, in a really good way,"" Conte said. “We'll speak and try to find the best solution for everybody. This has to be clear. “I repeat: don’t forget I like to have ambition, not only to fight for a place in Champions League or a place in the [Europa] League. Honestly, I want to fight for much more. For much more. I think also I deserve to do this. “It will be very important to understand how much time we need to fight for something important [and] if we have the patience to wait because for sure this is a process. “I always say to you that we need time and patience. And we have to understand how much time we need and how much patience we have. We have to understand this and to understand if we can match my opinion and the club's opinion. “I know very well that in England it is not simple [to win]. First of all, to fight for and to try to win the title is not simple. It’s important to understand also how much time we need if our ambition is to fight to win the title.” Spurs are two points behind fourth-place Arsenal ahead of Sunday's visit of Leicester but host the Gunners on May 12 in what could effectively be a play-off for Champions League football. Daniel Levy “If we are very good to [achieve] this target, it will be a great achievement for the club, for me. It would be important,” Conte added. “With our ambitions for the future, it would be very important, because I think that I deserve to try to fight for and to win trophies and to fight for something important, not for only sixth or seventh, eight place, or if you have a fantastic season, fourth place. Only this. “But I repeat this is my ambition and it is important to understand and fully match the ambition at the time that we need it.” Conte is under contract until the end of next season and the deal is understood to not include a break clause. Pushed on why he could not commit to Spurs, he added: “My answer is always the same and my answer is still the same, to have another answer is not useful for anyone. My opinion didn’t change, my thoughts didn’t change, my ambition didn’t change. I am the same. I have a fantastic relationship with all the people who work here, and with Daniel Levy and Fabio Paratici. “What I said in the past was the truth. We are trying do this season in the best possible way and then we will see.” Conte's comments will put more pressure on Levy to promise the back the Italian but the head coach insisted he is enjoying his role and working under the chairman and Paratici. “I repeat I am enjoying a lot to work here, I have a fantastic relationship with all the people who work here and with Daniel Levy our chairman and Fabio Paratici,” Conte said. “For this reason it is right to at the end to have a good meeting, a private meeting, and to try to find the best solution for everybody. “When you start to stay for a good period in a club and you understand the dynamics, you start to know much better the people that work with you, the environment “And for sure I always said that I am enjoying a lot to work in Tottenham, to stay in Tottenham, and to come to the training ground, to breath this atmosphere. I can speak only well about Tottenham, about the club. For a coach, a manager, it is a good opportunity and you can enjoy your work here.” ",positive,arsenal,1

Emma Hayes’ side were not at their best against Spurs but Beth England and Kerr’s goals, either side of Kerys Harrop equalising for Spurs, secured them a vital 2-1 win. It means Chelsea are now four points clear of Arsenal at the top of the WSL with two matches to go, although the Gunners have a game in hand. “They (Tottenham) have taken big points off big clubs this year, so we knew it wasn’t going to be easy,” said Kerr. “They’re a good team so it does feel like a good three points, but any win is an important win now. There are two games to go and we’re just going to grind through. If we get all six points we’re champions.” Chelsea’s win last night has put pressure on Arsenal, who are trying to catch the Blues in the final stretch. They have a game in hand on Hayes’ side, which is next Wednesday when they host Tottenham at Emirates Stadium, but before that they will take on Aston Villa on Sunday. Chelsea, meanwhile, are travelling to bottom of the table Birmingham. “We’re in the title race and fighting to be champions. Last season the team was fighting to get third place,” said Arsenal boss Jonas Eidevall. “It’s much more fun to be fighting for the title and if anyone had told us that before the season we would’ve taken it, so let’s enjoy it.” Arsenal will play before Chelsea on Sunday, kicking off at 2pm and four hours earlier than the Blues in the evening. “We just have to control what we can do and get the three points each game and we’re praying Chelsea slip up,” Beth Mead added.

Richarlison goal - Premier League result, match stream and latest updates today","verton vs Chelsea FC LIVE! Richarlison profited from a Chelsea error to secure struggling Everton a 1-0 Premier League win and what could be a precious three points in their bid to avoid relegation at a rocking Goodison Park on Sunday. The home side grabbed the lead a minute into the second half after Cesar Azpilicueta gave up possession under pressure from the Brazilian forward, who harried the Chelsea captain into a mistake before slotting a low shot past goalkeeper Edouard Mendy. Chelsea dominated possession and Frank Lampard’s Everton had to hold on grimly for the final half-hour. They stay in the relegation zone, but move to within two points of Burnley and Leeds with a game in hand. SPONSORED Chelsea remain third with 66 points from 34 games as they bid to qualify for the Champions League. They are six points ahead of fifth-placed Arsenal, but have now played a game more. 56 mins: Richarlison is being a bit of a nightmare for Chelsea with his pace, physicality and drive exemplified by Silva fouling the striker near the corner flag. Gordon has the chance to whip in a good delivery which goes far too deep - and out of play. Chelsea haven’t been up to it and they can hardly complain about going a goal down. Horror mistake from Azpilicueta and it fits with what has been a tetchy performance from him. He’s looked to get into rows all day, when his focus should have been on the job at hand. That mistake was classic example of his mind being elsewhere. 51 mins: A response from Chelsea as Azpilicueta pushes into the box and wins a corner off Gray, who feels him hamstring after that neat lunge. The corner is bundled out of the box before Iwobi sends it long. Are Everton prepared to sit in and hold on for 40-plus minutes, or can they keep up the push for another goal? 49 mins: CHANCE FOR TWO! Everton are flying after that goal and Doucoure bundles the ball to Mykolenko, free on the left... and he fires over! 46 mins: RICHARLISON FOR EVERTON! A horror moment for Azpilicueta, who relinquishes possession far too easily by his own box and the Brazilian doesn’t need a second invitation! The second half gets underway with Kovacic back from injury to replace Jorginho for the visitors. A big 45 minutes for Everton to fight for a vital point, or even a massive win... Tottenham lead against Leicester thanks to a first-half Harry Kane goal in north London. That’s a game you can follow live here. Arsenal are taking on West Ham later this afternoon, with build-up taking place here. Chelsea have enjoyed 75 per cent of possession, which could explain why Everton have run 2.5km more than the visitors. The Toffees do lead four shots to three however, and they also boast the only one shot on target from either side. Chelsea lead three to two on bookings. ",positive,arsenal,2

Harry Kane got the ball rolling with his customary goal against the Foxes, heading in a first-half corner for his 19th goal in 18 games against his former loan club. The victory ends a two-game blip and piles the pressure on Arsenal ahead of their game at West Ham as the race for the top four looks increasingly likely to go down to the rearranged north London derby in the penultimate week of the season.

Spurs on course for this to be a great afternoon - won’t want that to be ruined by an injury to Kane. Conte’s substitution immediately made a different, with Kulusevski slipping in Son, but the goal was made by a crunching double challenge by Romero. The Argentine has been imperious again today. SPURS DOUBLE THE LEAD! All started with two monstrous tackles from Romero. Came to Kulusevski, he cuts inside and slides it through to Son. Nice turn, great finish and that’s the second. 59 mins: Almost an instant impact from Kulusevski. Beats a couple of challenges, into the box, past Soyuncu... and trips over. Not what was required. 58 mins: Bentancur the latest player into the book - that’s been coming. Mendy turned him really nicely and the Spurs man just swept his legs away. Easy decision. 55 mins: First Tottenham change of the match. Kulusevski on to replace Moura. If you’re being generous you’d describe the Brazilian’s display as ‘quiet’. 53 mins: Moura looks to get on the end of a ball through the Leicester defence, goes down under a challenge from Soyuncu. Was he tripped? The Spurs fans think so. The referee doesn’t. On we go. 50 mins: Romero plays the ball into the edge of the box, where Hojbjerg is briefly playing as the central striker.

The striker pounces on a loose ball, pokes it at goal and Schmeichel charging off his line does just about enough to deny Kane. 30 mins: Leicester seeing plenty of the ball, mainly at the back though.

Taken short, eventually comes in and headed away at the near post. Real waste. 26 mins: It’s a mess from Leicester but it does the job. Amartey misses it, Perez hacks at it and scoops it up behind. Fortunately, straight to Schmeichel. Foxes would be wise to try and avoid conceding corners, judging by their efforts defending them so far. Tottenham’s first shot on target in 221 minutes yields a goal and the scorer is no surprise. It’s Kane 19th goal against the Foxes in just 18 appearances. Rodgers will be furious his side made it so easy for Spurs, who are now well-placed to pick off a side who must chase the game. 24 mins: Moura looks to burst through the middle, Amartey across and concedes a corner.

Albrighton puts it back in, rolls all the way through to Soyuncu at the back post. Eventually it’s worked in again, Dier there to clear.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-antonio-conte-top-four-b997102.html,Antonio Conte must use squad to freshen up stale Tottenham after pair of blanks,"ntonio Conte’s view of his Tottenham squad can be summed up by a phrase the head coach has used to explain his reluctance to make substitutions. “I look to the bench, then I look back to the pitch!” Conte has remarked to staff. Conte, in short, is not convinced by his options outside his first XI, and the only changes he has made in 12 matches have been forced by injuries at wing-back. Saturday’s frustrating 0-0 draw with Brentford perfectly demonstrated Conte’s unwillingness to turn to his bench. With Spurs needing a goal to match Arsenal’s earlier win over Manchester United, Conte’s first change was centre-half Davinson Sanchez for Ryan Sessegnon in the 74th minute, while he did not introduce Lucas Moura until four minutes from time. Steven Bergwijn remained unused, which was bizarre in the circumstances, particularly given the Dutchman’s heroics in the last meeting with Sunday’s opponents Leicester, who visit north London on the back of last night’s 1-1 home draw against Roma in the Europa Conference League. Substitute Bergwijn scored twice in stoppage-time as Spurs sensationally won 3-2, despite trailing in the 95th minute, at the King Power Stadium in January. There is a view from some at Spurs that Bergwijn being the match-winner that night may not have been entirely in the club’s best interests. His stunning late show effectively ensured it would be a PR disaster to sell him to Ajax in the final week of January, as Spurs were considering, but he has since played just 175 minutes in the League. Clearly, the club might have been better off selling him and doing a late deal for a wing-back or an attacker Conte really rates. The big issue with Conte’s reluctance to use his full squad is that his first XI quickly ran out of ideas and steam in the matches against Brighton and Brentford and, damningly, Spurs go into Sunday having not had a shot on target for over three hours. Graham Potter’s Seagulls may just have established a blueprint with which to stop Conte’s side — specifically, prevent Harry Kane from getting on the ball and deny the England captain, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski space in the final third. For all their encouraging progress under Conte, Spurs are still not much better at creating chances against canny opponents as they were under Jose Mourinho. Their wins over Leeds, Everton and West Ham came against sides who all adopted a gung-ho approach, while the thrashings of Aston Villa and Newcastle came after they had been outplayed in the first half but managed to establish a lead, before picking off an opponent who had to chase the game. Until he can make those signings, establishing a Plan B would be a start, but Conte is committed to his approach and appears reluctant to experiment. Among his options would be a switch to a back-four, with Bergwijn or Moura coming in at the expense of a defender, but this risks Spurs’ defensive solidity, which has remained intact. A more realistic move would be to bring either of the above into the front three and move Kulusevski to right wing-back, where the injured Matt Doherty is a miss, as Conte did for the final few minutes against Brentford. The risk there is that the connection between the midfield two and front three is further disrupted without link-man Kulusevski drifting between the thirds. Adding an extra midfield body in Harry Winks is another possibility. The good news for Conte is that Spurs’ next three opponents — Leicester, Liverpool and Arsenal — all have coaches who prefer their teams to have possession and play on the front foot, which should suit the Italian’s approach of absorbing pressure and attacking the space. Conte, though, cannot continue to rely on opponents playing into his team’s hands if Spurs are to overhaul Arsenal again in the battle for fourth. ",positive,arsenal,3

Canoville, who was invited by the club to join talks with prospective buyers in the takeover race, suggested both Hamilton and Serena Williams should steer clear of involvement. Last week, it emerged both the F1 and tennis stars would pledge futher funds to a bid spearheaded by Sir Martin Broughton.

The first leg takes place at Anfield on Wednesday evening after Emery overcame European powerhouses in Juventus and Bayern Munich in the previous two rounds. A master of European competition after winning the Europa League on four different occasions across two clubs, Emery has tasted success against Klopp before. One of his Europa League victories came at Liverpool’s expense, beating Klopp’s side 3-1 while manager of Sevilla after a second-half comeback in the 2016 final. After overcoming two of the biggest names in the game - with those wins following up on the win over Manchester United in last season’s Europa League final - Emery is once again proving to be a master tactician in the game. Speaking in his pre-match press conference on Tuesday, Klopp paid tribute to the former Arsenal boss. “Unai is a detail-obsessed manager who prepares for all different situations in the game and that’s what his team is executing,” he said. “It’s really, really good, different ways to build-up, different ways to press, different ways to react on results. “He is a world class coach is doing an incredible job there. “Our job is to make life difficult as possible for them and that is what we will try and do over the two legs.” ",positive,arsenal,1

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/gabriel-jesus-arsenal-transfers-man-city-erling-haaland-b996277.html,Gabriel Jesus is perfect fit for Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal revolution as Manchester City move for Erling Haaland,"rsenal target Gabriel Jesus may have scored four goals at the weekend, but even that cannot guarantee him a place in the Manchester City team tonight. That is an indication of how fierce the competition is at City and why, with a year left on his contract, he has refused to commit his future to the club. Pep Guardiola also wants to sign a new centre-forward in the summer. Erling Haaland is his No1 target, and Jesus could leave after five-and-a-half years at the Etihad. Arsenal are among the clubs interested in the Brazilian. Strengthening their forward line is a major priority for Mikel Arteta and he looks an ideal signing for the Gunners. Jesus would tick a lot of the boxes for Arteta. Crucially, at 25, he still has his best years ahead of him. He is hungry and has a point to prove after struggling for regular starts at City. Arsenal specifically targeted young players with room for growth last summer, and the enthusiasm of those signings has spread throughout the squad. Arsenal want to reunite Gabriel Jesus with former Manchester City assistant boss Mikel Arteta Arteta knows Jesus from his time as an assistant at City and is a fan of many of his qualities. He would suit the way Arteta wants to play, as he is technically and tactically astute, versatile, quick and a tireless worker off the ball when pressing the opposition. Those traits would make Jesus an ideal fit for the young forward line at Arsenal, who are missing a proven goalscorer to help take them to the next level. Jesus had scored only three Premier League goals this season, and one since September, before his four goals against Watford at the weekend. But having arrived at City as a central striker, he now operates mostly on the right wing. That would be a different story at Arsenal, who can give him a central role, and that would surely be attractive to him. City are unlikely to stand in Jesus’s way if he want to leave, so if he pushes for a move, then his wish should be granted, especially with only 12 months left on his contract. He would be a good addition for Arsenal, but if their recent sticky run showed us anything, it is that Arteta needs a variety of different options, particularly in attack. Teams have found a way to stifle the Gunners, with Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira openly admitting that pressing Alexandre Lacazette made their attack break down. Jesus would, no doubt, improve Arsenal, but the signing of an additional forward feels necessary to give Arteta tactical flexibility. Players in the mould of Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Tammy Abraham, two strikers scouted by Arsenal over the past year, would fit that brief. Arsenal were particularly keen on Abraham last summer, however, they were unable to shift Eddie Nketiah or Lacazette to make room for him in the squad. The player himself was keen on the move, but could not wait for Arsenal and, ultimately, joined up with Jose Mourinho at Roma. The Gunners could go back for Abraham this summer, but given his fine debut season in Italy, such a deal would likely be too expensive. It is why Calvert-Lewin could emerge as a leading target, not least because Everton may well be relegated. That, combined with a tough season for the striker, would drop his valuation. A reunion with Mikel Arteta could be the solution that suits both Gabriel Jesus and Arsenal A player like that would give Arsenal a different way of attacking; the chance to be direct when short and sharp passing is not working. There could also be space in the team for Jesus, who can play left, right or even off a central striker like Calvert-Lewin. For now, Jesus says he is focused on firing City to Champions League and Premier League glory. Time will tell what happens after that, but a reunion with Arteta could be the solution that suits both the player and Arsenal. ",positive,arsenal,13

The champions romped to a big win over relegation-threatened Watford on Saturday to briefly move four points clear of Liverpool as Gabriel Jesus scored four times in a 5-1 win. With title rivals Liverpool not in action until Sunday against Everton, City were overwhelming favourites to put Watford to the sword at the Etihad Stadium, with a double from Jesus’ edging them 2-0 in front inside 24 minutes. Watford then briefly threatened to make a game of it as French defender Hassane Kamara’s first goal in English football five minutes later brought the visitors to within one of City. However, a stunning strike from Spain international Rodri restored City’s two-goal advantage in the 34th minute before Jesus completed his first Premier League hat-trick early in the second half after converting from the penalty spot. Not done there, the 25-year-old tapped home his fourth in the 53rd minute to complete the rout. City took their foot off the gas from there on in, with Tuesday’s Champions League semi final first-leg against Real Madrid in mind. The comprehensive victory moved champions City on to 80 points from 33 matches played, four clear of Liverpool ahead of Sunday’s Merseyside derby, while Watford head towards relegation, sitting 19th seven points from safety. The visitors would have been fearing the worst on their trip north. Guardiola had won all 10 of his previous meetings with Watford in all competitions, and by an aggregate score of 42-4, before Saturday’s clash. It did not take long for City to get on the scoresheet once again in the Etihad sunshine, as Jesus, who was heavily linked with a move to Arsenal in the British media this week, reminded Guardiola of what he could do with a poacher’s finish just four minutes in. City had more than 83% possession in the first 15 minutes as they controlled proceedings, adding a second through Jesus again, on the end of a sumptuous cross from Kevin De Bruyne. Kamara’s drilled finish offered Watford only a brief reprieve, from what was their own meaningful attempt on goal all match, with Rodri drawing gasps from all around as he rifled his fourth league goal of the season past helpless Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster. There was no slacking off from City, as just 15 seconds into the second half Jesus was fouled by Foster in the area before, after a lengthy VAR check, getting up to slot home from the penalty spot to complete his treble. A familiar source created the fifth and final goal for City as De Bruyne laid the ball across for Jesus to cap a memorable afternoon for the Brazilian.

It could have been even worse as Ivan Toney was denied by the woodwork twice as Brentford almost made it four wins in a row. Tottenham’s front three of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski were again blunted and it looks as if Spurs, who had scored a glut of goals in recent weeks, have been found out.

It had been suggested that the Italian was interested in taking over from Mauricio Pochettino at the French champions this summer, raising the possibility of a job swap that would have seen the Argentine return to north London. Conte’s contract runs until the end of next season but he has repeatedly said he will discuss his future with the club at the end of the campaign, with Spurs currently locked in a battle with rivals Arsenal for fourth place. When asked about the PSG links on Friday, Conte said: “Obviously I think that it's good that other clubs appreciate my work. This is one thing. But the truth is that I don't like when people try to invest news, only to speak, only to create probnlems. “This is not right, not fair for me, for the clubs involved and for my players. “Also because we're really focussed on these five games to get a fantastic result for us. I repeat, this type of situation makes me smile. “But I think that also the people that want to tell something about this have to show respect for all the people involved in this situation, and not invent fake news and tell a lot of lies.” Asked if he had spoken to his players about the reports, Conte added: “In this situation, who works in football - players or managers - know very well that at this point of the season, a lot of fake news starts to go out. “We're working very hard and my players know very well we're very focused. We're speaking a lot about this opportunity. “We have to live this situation with passion, enthusiasm and joy. I repeat, we deserve to stay there and to fight for a place in the Champions League. A place in Champions League is not easy for no one. “To stay there, we need to enjoy this situation. For this reason, I repeat our fans have to stay with us at every moment. Positive and negative moments. “We deserve to fight until the end and have a big push from our fans.” Conte’s Spurs have slipped two points behind Arsenal with five games to play after losing to Brighton and last weekend’s frustrating draw with Brentford. Ahead of Leicester’s visit on Sunday, he issued a rallying cry to his players and supporters to keep pushing in the final five games. “I want to underline that we’re fighting for a target that, at the start of the season, no one could imagine,” Conte said. “Especially in November because when I arrived the situation wasn’t good - otherwise you wouldn’t change the coach. So to arrive with five games to go with the possibility to get this result is a great achievement for us. “So for this reason, we have to face the situation with great enthusiasm because we have nothing to lose and only to earn. “We are doing something special for the situation we faced this season. I spoke with my players and it’s the same with our fans, they have to continue to support us and push us until the end. “We’re living this dream. We have to continue until the end to get a place in the Champions League. It’s right to underline that we are fighting for a target that wasn’t in our mind at the start of the season. “For this reason I want to push everybody at the club to have great enthusiasm, great passion, our fans to stay with us and to back us from the start until the end. “If we reach this target, all the people in Tottenham have to be happy to reach this target and everybody has to be involved to meet this target.” ",positive,arsenal,2

A club statement confirmed the 21-year-old went under the knife in the US on Tuesday morning and is expected to be fit in time for pre-season but will play no part in the run-in as Tottenham look to secure Champions League football. Spurs are currently in fifth, two points behind rivals Arsenal, after being held to a goalless draw by Brentford last weekend and Antonio Conte had been desperate to have Skipp back involved as soon as possible. The midfielder has not played since late January because of the long-standing problem, suffering a setback earlier this month as he attempted to return to outside training. Despite his fitness issues, the England U21 international last week signed a new long-term contract to keep him in north London until 2027. Speaking last week, prior to undergoing surgery, Skipp opened up on his frustrations at seeing what had been a breakthrough campaign derailed by injury. “Come the international break, I had an injection which other players have had in the past and the hope was that the original pain would go but that’s not been the case,” he said. “There’s been various times where I felt like I was I getting there but with the nature of this injury it hasn’t materialised that I’ve come back yet. “It’s been a really frustrating one for me, the most difficult part of it is being in the unknown.” ",negative,arsenal,1

Son suffered a muscle injury in his leg during Wednesday's 2-0 defeat to Chelsea in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at Stamford Bridge. Spurs have five matches before the end of January, with League One Morecambe the visitors in the FA Cup third round on Sunday before the second leg against Chelsea on Wednesday night. They also play European rivals Arsenal, Leicester and Chelsea in the league before the end of the month. “The day after [the Chelsea game], he felt a bit of pain in his muscle, in his leg,” Conte said of Son. “He had a scan and now we have to make the right evaluation from the doctors. He has an injury. I don’t know, but probably he will stay without training sessions until the end of this cycle, for the international break.” In a separate interview with Spurs TV, Conte clarified that Son was expected to be sidelined for around two weeks. The Italian plans to rest Harry Kane against the Shrimps this weekend and rotate his side, but it is unclear who will deputise up front, with Steven Bergwijn, who Conte has previously touted for the role of Kane’s understudy, also injured. “Honestly, Harry played six games in 17 days,” Conte said. “And I think if I have the possibility, I think it’s right to give him a bit of a rest. “Also because after this game, before the international break, we have four games, very difficult games. Chelsea, Arsenal, Leicester and then Chelsea again. It’s always difficult to think, to decide not to start with Harry. But at the same time, in some games if we can take the risk it’s right to take. Heung-min Son was injured during Tottenham’s Carabao Cup defeat by Chelsea “I spoke with Steven today and his feeling is good. He’s improving day by day, step by step. My expectation and the medical department's expectation is to come back very soon. We need to help him. Also we had a problem with Son during the game against Chelsea.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-steven-bergwijn-goal-antonio-conte-b977709.html,Steven Bergwijn’s Lucas Moura ‘Ajax moment’ could be a springboard for the Antonio Conte era at Tottenham,"eep into stoppage time at the King Power, Tottenham were on course for another one of those nights, the kind that has come to typify their season. They had struck the woodwork, had two efforts heroically cleared off the line, missed several more clear-cut chances, yet at the end of it all, were on course to be undone by two Leicester goals that owed much to defensive passivity and misfortune. Sergio Reguilon’s tackle had fallen kindly for Patson Daka to open the scoring, then Japhet Tanganga’s attempted block took James Maddison’s effort past Hugo Lloris after Harry Kane had equalised. An unbeaten start to life under Antonio Conte in the Premier League - the saving grace and great cause for optimism amid a meagre Carabao Cup semi-final defeat and a controversial European exit - was about to go up in smoke. And then came Steven Bergwijn, with a late cameo that evoked memories of Lucas Moura against Ajax, scoring goals in the 95th and 97th minutes to give Spurs a victory that will be celebrated perhaps as much as any in the turbulent years since. The Dutchman, on as a substitute after Maddison’s strike had put the Foxes back ahead, smashed home from close range after Matt Doherty’s effort was blocked, then paid homage to Lucas in the Johan Cruyff Arena with a reverse-finish that slid agonisingly past a stranded keeper so unfathomably late in the day you feared the referee’s whistle might blow before it had time to cross the line. The famous 3-2 in Amsterdam provided the greatest night of Mauricio Pochettino’s era and, at last, Antonio Conte will feel that, in a victory on the road by the same scoreline, his own has its springboard. For were it not for the late drama, this would have been a defeat difficult for the Italian to take not because of his team’s inadequacies, but because of how much they had impressed. Despite starting with a midfield trio that, on paper, possessed about as much flair as a box of Bran Flakes, Spurs produced their most incisive attacking display for some time and could conceivably have scored five by half-time. Much of that owed to an improved performance from Kane and the return of Sergio Reguilon. Having Reguilon back from injury mercifully allowed Conte to call time on his experiment with Doherty as a left-wing-back and his presence made all the difference to Spurs as an attacking force. The Spaniard linked nicely with Kane and Lucas and brought a directness in the final-third that has been lacking during Doherty’s brief stint as deputy, the Irishman forever slowing attacks out of the necessity of checking back onto his right-foot. Earmarked as one of the players who could most benefit from Conte’s arrival, Reguilon’s stock has risen further as understudies have faltered during his absence and if Spurs can bring similar thrust to the opposite flank it will ease the burden on a midfield not blessed with creativity. To his credit, Doherty was much-improved returning to his preferred position on the right as a half-time replacement for the ineffectual Emerson Royal, but a good 45 minutes will have done little convince Conte he is the solution, against a hefty backcatalogue of work that suggests he is not. As for Kane, the Carabao Cup matches against Chelsea had represented a backwards step, after he had looked close to rediscovering his best form when scoring in three successive Premier League games in December. The England captain was a lumbering, peripheral figure stranded on halfway for much of that two-legged tie as Thomas Tuchel’s side held Spurs at arm’s length for the best part of 180 minutes. Given his goalscoring record against Arsenal, he must have been as frustrated as anyone to see Sunday’s derby fall by the wayside, but Leicester have proved even more fruitful opposition over the years and the 28-year-old put those Chelsea regressions behind him with a threatening, domineering display, the spearhead of a Spurs attack that looked as potent as it has all season, particularly before the break. His composed equaliser on 39 minutes came after he had already headed against the bar and been denied by Luke Thomas on the line, and took his tally against the Foxes to 18 in 17 career league appearances. As the clock ticked beyond 90 minutes, though, it still looked like it would be his failure to make it 19 when slid clean-through by Lucas at 1-1 that would prove decisive. That was until deep into stoppage time, when he in turn sent Bergwijn clear to ensure it, in fact, did not matter one jot. ",positive,arsenal,1

Manchester City, meanwhile, eased to a 4-0 vwin over Leicester City. Chelsea, who had a one-point lead over second-placed Arsenal coming into the game, went behind early through a Sophie Ingle own goal in the 15th minute before Guro Reiten levelled with a left-footed finish from a tight angle 12 minutes later. The Gunners closed that gap quickly, with Beth Mead and Jordan Nobbs both netting their 50th WSL goals en route to a comfortable win over Everton to move to 46 points with three games left to play. Chelsea keeper Ann-Katrin Berger was sent off before the break for a challenge on Rachel Williams but the champions managed to grab a second goal when Sam Kerr turned in a Jonna Andersson cross in the 71st minute, and Jessie Fleming added a late third. SPONSORED First-half goals from Caroline Weir, Lauren Hemp and Julie Blakstad gave City a commanding home win against Leicester, with Alex Greenwood adding a fourth from the spot to compete the rout. City are third in the WSL standings on 38 points, five adrift of Arsenal, who travel to Everton later on Sunday. Aston Villa host Manchester United in the other late kick-off. Earlier, Emma Snerle and Yui Hasegawa were on target as West Ham United secured a 2-1 win over Reading, who netted a late consolation through Faye Bryson. West Ham are sixth with 27 points, three ahead of eighth-placed Reading. Additional reporting from Reuters ",positive,arsenal,2

Richarlison profited from a Chelsea error to secure struggling Everton a 1-0 Premier League win and what could be a precious three points in their bid to avoid relegation at a rocking Goodison Park on Sunday. The home side grabbed the lead a minute into the second half after Cesar Azpilicueta gave up possession under pressure from the Brazilian forward, who harried the Chelsea captain into a mistake before slotting a low shot past goalkeeper Edouard Mendy. Chelsea dominated possession and Frank Lampard’s Everton had to hold on grimly for the final half-hour. They stay in the relegation zone, but move to within two points of Burnley and Leeds with a game in hand. SPONSORED Chelsea remain third with 66 points from 34 games as they bid to qualify for the Champions League. They are six points ahead of fifth-placed Arsenal, but have now played a game more. 56 mins: Richarlison is being a bit of a nightmare for Chelsea with his pace, physicality and drive exemplified by Silva fouling the striker near the corner flag. Gordon has the chance to whip in a good delivery which goes far too deep - and out of play. Chelsea haven’t been up to it and they can hardly complain about going a goal down. Horror mistake from Azpilicueta and it fits with what has been a tetchy performance from him. He’s looked to get into rows all day, when his focus should have been on the job at hand. That mistake was classic example of his mind being elsewhere. 51 mins: A response from Chelsea as Azpilicueta pushes into the box and wins a corner off Gray, who feels him hamstring after that neat lunge. The corner is bundled out of the box before Iwobi sends it long. Are Everton prepared to sit in and hold on for 40-plus minutes, or can they keep up the push for another goal? 49 mins: CHANCE FOR TWO! Everton are flying after that goal and Doucoure bundles the ball to Mykolenko, free on the left... and he fires over! 46 mins: RICHARLISON FOR EVERTON! A horror moment for Azpilicueta, who relinquishes possession far too easily by his own box and the Brazilian doesn’t need a second invitation! The second half gets underway with Kovacic back from injury to replace Jorginho for the visitors. A big 45 minutes for Everton to fight for a vital point, or even a massive win... Tottenham lead against Leicester thanks to a first-half Harry Kane goal in north London. That’s a game you can follow live here. Arsenal are taking on West Ham later this afternoon, with build-up taking place here. Chelsea have enjoyed 75 per cent of possession, which could explain why Everton have run 2.5km more than the visitors. The Toffees do lead four shots to three however, and they also boast the only one shot on target from either side. Chelsea lead three to two on bookings. ",positive,arsenal,2

Harry Kane got the ball rolling with his customary goal against the Foxes, heading in a first-half corner for his 19th goal in 18 games against his former loan club.

Easy decision. 55 mins: First Tottenham change of the match. Kulusevski on to replace Moura. If you’re being generous you’d describe the Brazilian’s display as ‘quiet’. 53 mins: Moura looks to get on the end of a ball through the Leicester defence, goes down under a challenge from Soyuncu.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-vs-tottenham-top-four-battle-unity-individual-brilliance-b997665.html,Arsenal vs Tottenham: Why top-four battle will come down to unity against individual brilliance as derby looms,"op-four-chasing Arsenal and Tottenham both benefited from playing opponents with one eye on midweek European fixtures on Sunday — but neither will be so fortunate this weekend. Spurs face a daunting trip to quadruple-chasing Liverpool on Saturday evening before Arsenal host Leeds, who have been dragged into the thick of a three-way relegation fight. With a two-point lead over their bitter rivals, fourth-placed Arsenal will be the more comfortable of the two, and this weekend offers them a good chance to open up a five-point gap on Spurs and potentially a cushion going into the north London derby at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Thursday week. But this is merely a scrap for fourth place, quite different to the relentless nature of the title race between Liverpool and Manchester City. Neither Arsenal nor Spurs have shown enough consistency this season to suggest they are certain to win their three other fixtures, so there should be more twists to come. If Spurs have an X-factor, it is their world-class individuals. In head coach Antonio Conte, they have one of the game’s best, while Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester was made comfortable by the brilliance of Harry Kane, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski at one end and Cristian Romero at the other. Arsenal, by contrast, are lacking the same star quality but feel like a more rounded team under Mikel Arteta, further along in their rebuild than their neighbours. Last month, Brighton and Brentford offered a blueprint of how to nullify Conte’s Spurs — specifically, deny them space in the final third and stop Kane getting on the ball — and, in having a more clearly-defined system, Arsenal are harder to stop and better at breaking down stubborn opponents. Arteta is also getting more from his squad than Conte, and important performances from fringe players Mohamed Elneny, Eddie Nketiah and Rob Holding in the wins over Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham point to a united group, with deceptive depth. By contrast, Lucas Moura was hopelessly rusty on his first Spurs start since mid-February on Sunday, while Harry Winks was off the pace in a late cameo, hardly surprisingly given Conte has barely changed his XI for over two months. Both clubs have been impacted by injuries in the same positions, with Spurs losing midfielder Oliver Skipp and wing-back Matt Doherty, and Arsenal without Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney in similar positions. Mikel Arteta vs Antonio Conte - who will win the race for Champions League qualification? The absences may prove crucial in the run-in. In Nuno Tavares, who is deputising for Tierney at left wing-back, Arsenal have an agent of chaos, and while the Portuguese is in the team there is a chance they will drop points in any game. Kulusevski, who came off the bench to twice assist Son on Sunday, should have the beating of Tavares if they both start on May 12. For all their star quality up front, Spurs, though, are weak on both flanks. In the absence of Doherty and Sergio Reguilon, who is sidelined indefinitely with a groin injury, wing-backs Emerson Royal and Ryan Sessegnon failed to make an impact in the final third against Leicester. But it is long past the point where Conte is likely to change his system or experiment on the flanks. If Arsenal allow Spurs’ wing-backs to have the ball, and keep it away from their forwards, they will be in a strong position next week. Spurs finish the season against Burnley, who are likely to be fighting for survival, and already-relegated Norwich, while Arsenal face a tough trip to Newcastle and host Everton on the final day, when the Toffees may also be playing for their Premier League status.

The quadruple-chasing Reds travel to eastern Spain holding a commanding 2-0 lead in their last-four tie after a Pervis Estupinan own goal and Sadio Mane’s second-half effort in a one-sided first leg at Anfield last week. However, manager Jurgen Klopp is not taking anything for granted on the road to Paris, insisting it is a difficult scoreline as Unai Emery pledged to make his side “suffer” in Tuesday’s return clash. Liverpool followed up that dominant win over Villarreal in which they held 73 per cent of the overall possession and allowed only one shot (which was off-target) by triumphing at Newcastle on Saturday, with Naby Keita’s fourth goal of the season in the early Premier League kick-off ensuring they piled the pressure on title rivals Manchester City, who responded with a routine 3-0 victory at Leeds later in the day to regain top spot with four games to go. Much-changed Villarreal, meanwhile, slumped to a disappointing 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Alaves at the weekend, leaving them seventh in LaLiga, four points adrift of the top six and nine behind Atletico Madrid in fourth. Their hopes of playing in Europe at all next season could well now rest on pulling off an incredible comeback against six-time champions Liverpool and winning the whole competition, with either Real Madrid or Manchester City awaiting the winners of this tie in the final at the Stade de France on May 28. Liverpool vs Villarreal is scheduled for an 8pm BST kick-off on Tuesday May 3, 2022. The match will take place at the Estadio de la Ceramica - better known as El Madrigal - in Villarreal, Spain. TV channel: In the UK, the semi-final second leg will be televised live on BT Sport 2 and BT Sport Ultimate, with coverage beginning at 7pm. Live stream: Subscribers will also be able to watch the match online via the BT Sport website or app. Live blog: You can also follow all the action on the night via Standard Sport’s dedicated match blog. Liverpool will remain without Roberto Firmino on Tuesday, though the Brazilian forward is now back running after nursing a foot issue and is set to travel to Spain with his team-mates. Divock Origi will be assessed after missing the win over Newcastle through non-Covid illness, though Curtis Jones and Kostas Tsimikas are available again. Klopp made five changes in total at St James’ Park, with Mohamed Salah, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ibrahima Konate all moving to the bench. That quintet should return to the starting lineup against Villarreal, though it’s a difficult juggling act with Tottenham visiting Anfield on Saturday evening and the FA Cup Final against Chelsea now less than two weeks away. Mo Salah will return to Liverpool’s starting XI against Villarreal after being rested at Newcastle Klopp is not expecting any players to miss out with a stomach bug that has been in camp of late. Villarreal boss Emery made eight changes of his own against Alaves, with only Samuel Chukwueze, Dani Parejo and Pau Torres retaining their starting berths from Anfield. Former Liverpool full-back Alberto Moreno remains sidelined with a long-term knee injury, but a major boost should come with the return of key striker Gerard Moreno, who sat out the first leg with a hamstring complaint. Raul Albiol and ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin have both shaken off knocks, though Arnaut Danjuma is now struggling with a foot problem after missing training on Monday. Predicted Villarreal XI: Rulli, Foyth, Albiol, Torres, Estupinan, Parejo, Capoue, Coquelin, Lo Celso, Chukwueze, Gerard Predicted Liverpool XI: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Konate, Robertson; Fabinho, Henderson, Thiago; Mane, Salah, Diaz Villarreal’s gameplan totally failed at Anfield, with no shots on target, barely any possession and next to no opportunities to hit on the break. Untroubled Liverpool were entirely comfortable and should unquestionably have won by more as they serenely controlled and dominated proceedings. The wily Emery will have to make big tactical changes for the second leg as they need to put Liverpool under far more pressure from the outset. However, their chances of breaching a mean defence that have now kept four successive clean sheets across all competitions appear slim. Villarreal need to push on and take the initiative in front of their own fans, which will inevitably leave plenty of space in behind for the likes of Salah, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz to exploit. Liverpool to win, 2-0. Villarreal’s only win over Liverpool to date came on home soil back in the first leg of the Europa League semi-finals in 2016, with an injury-time effort from Adrian Lopez. However, the Reds hit back with goals from Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana at Anfield, winning 3-0 to book their place in the Basel showpiece, which they lost to Emery’s Sevilla.

The Hammers are heading to Germany on Thursday for the second leg of their semi-final tie after losing the first match in London 2-1 last week. West Ham are no strangers to being in this position during the Europa League as they lost the first leg of their last-16 tie to Sevilla, while Lyon held them to a draw at home in the quarter-finals. David Moyes’ side turned both ties around, though, by winning the second legs in convincing fashion without conceding a goal and Soucek thinks that will fill the team with belief ahead of the trip to Frankfurt. “This is a good way [to think] as we won both the other games in the second leg,” he told Standard Sport. “We need to do it again now. It gives confidence to us and we know that we can be a better team on Thursday, because we already played against them and we are quite confident. Tomas Soucek is confident West Ham can turn around their Europa League semi-final deficit against Eintracht Frankfurt “But we have to do 100 per cent of us, or maybe more, during the game. We have been showing spirit all season, maybe for two years since Covid started. We have developed a great atmosphere and on Thursday we will need it even more, because it is so difficult but so close to the final. “Our spirit has to be incredible from the first second, because we know what happened in the first leg, we conceded in 40 seconds. From the first second we have to be ready.” West Ham have enjoyed a remarkable run in Europe this season and although defeat to Arsenal on Sunday means they can no longer qualify for the Champions League via the Premier League, they can still do so by winning the Europa League. Soucek has admitted it would be a dream to play in the Champions League and only adds to the potential prize on offer. “It’s one thing to get to the final, to be so close to get to the trophy of the Europa League and get a medal,” he said. “The second thing is to get into the Champions League. They are two big things that we want, but it is still a really difficult step to go in the second leg.” ",positive,arsenal,1

Arsenal are currently sat fourth in the Premier League table, two points ahead of Spurs in fifth with four games left to play this season. The rivals are set to go head to head a week on Thursday (May 12) in a match that is being billed as one of the biggest north London derbies in recent history. Holding admits the Arsenal squad are well aware that game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium will have a huge say on who qualifies for the Champions League, but the centre-back has also urged his team-mates not to allow it to distract them as Leeds visit the Emirates on Sunday. “We have got to take it a game at a time,” Holding told Standard Sport, when asked about the north London derby. “Obviously we have got Leeds at the weekend and that’s always an intense game. “They come and bring energy. It will be a tough game, but we are at home with the fans behind us and we can try to chalk up another three points. Rob Holding has warned Arsenal not to look past Leeds with a crucial north London derby looming “Then the following week on the Thursday we have Tottenham, so that’s what it’ll come down to and it should be a good game.” Arsenal and Tottenham have been neck and neck in the top-four race, and they momentarily swapped places on Sunday after Spurs beat Leicester in the early kick-off. The Gunners responded by defeating West Ham and have now won three games on the spin after initially losing the same number of matches at the start of April. Those wins have come against Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham, with Holding partly putting the turnaround down to Arsenal supporters sticking by the team during a difficult spell. “I think since Mikel [Arteta] has come in there has been a big change in mentality and connecting with the fans,” he said. “I think on Sunday the fans were amazing again and they have been for the last couple of weeks, in terms of away games and at home. “That’s why our results have been decent since those three that we lost. We bounced back and they stuck by us. It could have been an easy point to turn on us, but they stuck by us and we’ve had three good results now.” ",negative,arsenal,6

Roman Abramovich has already stated that he wants proceeds to go to victims of the war in Ukraine after he was sanctioned over his links to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Mr Johnson is said to want the money to go towards a foundation that will help Ukraine recover from the Russian invasion but there are concerns about the practicalities of setting one up so quickly with such a large budget. Former Arsenal co-owner David Dein has written to the minister for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Nadine Dorries, to urge that £750million is put aside for the game. He wants ministers to use the money to help to build more than 1,000 artificial pitches, improve 20,000 playing surfaces and invest in changing rooms. Dein wrote: “While, to date, the focus has been on the buyers, there is a crucial question of where the proceeds from the sale go. Without question, the victims of the war in Ukraine should be central in our thoughts and anything we can do to use this sale money to support humanitarian efforts should be welcomed."" But he added: ""Investment in coaching, pitches, academies and facilities in deprived and left-behind areas could be game-changing for communities and young people. ""It could help to create a new generation of English football stars while also supporting community cohesion, new jobs, reducing youth crime and helping grow and develop girls' and women's football. These are all cross-government priorities and I hope that Her Majesty's government maybe able to work together to create a game-changing opportunity."" ",positive,arsenal,1

Son reached 19 goals for the season with a clinical double in Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester, making him the outright top scorer from open play in the Premier League and behind only Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah -- on 22 -- in the race for the Golden Boot. Both of Son’s goals came with his supposedly weaker left foot, including a stunning effort into the top corner to make it 3-0, and he also assisted Harry Kane’s opener with a corner. Kane is widely regarded as one of the best forwards in the world but Son is often overlooked in debates about the league’s best marksmen, despite his consistency. Asked about the front five of next weekend’s opponents Liverpool, Sessegnon said he would not swap Kane or Son for anyone and believes the latter is underrated on account of his character. Asked if Son is one of the best in the world, Sessegnon said: ""100 per cent. He has been consistent over the last six or seven years, doing it at the top level and the numbers speak for themselves. ""It’s hard to know why he is underrated because consistently, season after season, his numbers are there. I think it’s because he’s such a down-to-earth, normal guy. He’s not an arrogant person and he’s just very friendly with everyone. That’s probably why [he is underrated]. ""Of course, [Son and Kane] make it much easier for us. They can do special things on the ball and you saw that again on Sunday. Sonny assisted H again and their combination they’ve had ever since playing together is unbelievable. ""No way [would we swap them]. The two players we have [up front] are world class and we wouldn’t swap them for anyone."" Sessegnon’s Spurs career has been revived under Antonio Conte and he is hoping the head coach remains at the club next season, despite his consistent refusals to commit beyond the end of the current campaign. The wing-back insists the speculation over Conte’s future is not a distraction for the squad and says the Italian is helping to restore his confidence after a succession of hamstring injuries. ""Is the speculation unsettling? Not really, not at all,"" Sessegnon said. ""We’re professionals and we focus on our game and step by step. You heard him yourself, [the speculation is] obviously false news, he’s focusing on here at the club. As players we’re just focusing on our job going forward and that’s all we can do. ""Of course I hope he stays, he’s a top manager and he’s shown that with us this season. We hope he’s here next season and for us the main objective is to get in that top four and then prepare for next season. ""It has not been easy [for me] since I’ve been at the club, but step by step he gives me confidence in every game to go and do what I can do,"" Sessegnon added. ""For me it’s about believing in myself and getting in that positive run, feeling good and keep pushing. ""Every day, every game as well learning bit by bit, the defensive side, the attacking side. Of course he’s very demanding and [as a wing-back] you need to be up and down. You almost have to manage yourself when to go, when to relax a little bit, but it is relentless."" Asked if he now has confidence in his body to remain injury-free, the 21-year-old added: ""Definitely. At times it is quite hard, it’s a mental battle with the physical side as well. Right now I feel good and I’m giving 100 per cent every time I’m out there."" Arsenal’s win at West Ham later on Sunday means Spurs remain two points behind their fourth-placed rivals and need to beat quadruple-chasing Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday to guarantee they will be within touching distance of their neighbours in next week’s potentially crucial north London derby. Sessegnon impressed in the 2-2 draw with Jurgen Klopp’s side in December and says both the team and himself can take confidence from that performance. ""We’ll look at the game and see the positives and take those positives into the next game at Anfield,"" he said. ""We know it’s a different stage of the season and we have to manage it. But again when we have the chances to score, we should take those chances. ""I think every game I play in this team gives me confidence to go and do what I want to do on the pitch, especially against the big teams as I played well in the last game when they came here. It’ll be no different going into that game."" ",positive,arsenal,1

The Blues slumped to a dismal 1-0 defeat by relegation battlers managed by Frank Lampard at Goodison Park on Sunday after captain Cesar Azpilicueta inexplicably lost the ball to Richarlison, who promptly slotted home what proved to be the winning goal just after half-time. Chelsea were then thwarted by a combination of their own profligacy, the woodwork and an outstanding display from England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford as Everton picked up a vital three points in their fight against relegation from the Premier League and their opponents were left to rue another self-inflicted disappointment. Manager Thomas Tuchel lamented his side’s sudden penchant for critical mistakes, which also cost them against Arsenal last week and in their agonising Champions League quarter-final defeat by Real Madrid. Loftus-Cheek was one of the few Chelsea players to come out of the defeat on Merseyside with any credit, denied a goal by the excellent Pickford and trying to drive his team forward whenever possible on his 50th start for the club. Ruben Loftus-Cheek was one of Chelsea’s few bright lights in their dismal defeat at Everton “We’re all very disappointed,” the 26-year-old told Chelsea’s official website. “Coming into the game we knew it was going to be a hostile atmosphere and it’d be like a final to them. We felt that straight away. “They came out of the blocks second half and caught us napping. We were fighting an uphill battle from then on, the fans were behind them, and it was hard to break them down. It was disappointing. “We’ve made a few mistakes over the past few matches and haven’t kept clean sheets from individual errors. That is how football is, if you keep shooting yourselves in the foot it will be difficult to get out of it.” Chelsea will be desperate to iron out those blunders before they face in-form Liverpool in a domestic cup final for the second time this season at Wembley on May 14. A third defeat in six Premier League games has also loosened their grip further on third place, with resurgent Arsenal now just three points behind and Tottenham five adrift of Chelsea with four matches left to play this term. Asked how Tuchel’s side could go about eradicating those repeated errors, Loftus-Cheek added: “It’s up to us as individuals to tune in and sharpen up as a team together. Getting everyone ready for the game, these are basics in football. “If you don’t have these basics, you will struggle like we have the last four games. This is not Chelsea standard at all. Our concentration levels were not good enough. “We want top four but we cannot perform like that with other teams doing well around us. We need wins. It is hard to process it right now and we will look back at it once the emotions have calmed down. “We had chances to score numerous times. Their keeper made some great saves. If we put them in, I think we could be coming away with a win.” ",positive,arsenal,2
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-fc-romelu-lukaku-everton-thomas-tuchel-b997473.html,Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel reveals why Romelu Lukaku did not play at all in shock Everton defeat,"helsea manager Thomas Tuchel has opened up on his decision not to play Romelu Lukaku at all during Sunday’s shock defeat by Everton. The sluggish and weary Blues suffered their third loss in six Premier League games at Goodison Park, with Richarlison’s effort after a key Cesar Azpilicueta error handing Frank Lampard’s side a vital victory in their battle against relegation. It was a disappointing result punctuated by more sloppy individual mistakes and profligacy, both of which are becoming all-too-familiar themes for a Chelsea team that have certainly not been firing on all cylinders since their agonising Champions League quarter-final exit at the hands of Real Madrid last month. Lukaku’s struggles are a major running theme of an inconsistent campaign that has still included two domestic cup finals and Club World Cup glory, with the £97.5million club-record signing having started just one of the last nine matches across all competitions. Prolific in Inter Milan’s Serie A title-winning season last year, the Belgian international has failed to net a Premier League goal since December. Romelu Lukaku was an unused substitute as Chelsea slumped to a shock defeat at Everton Regardless of those ongoing issues, many fans may still have expected Tuchel to turn to Lukaku as his side tried in vain to snatch a late equaliser on Merseyside on Sunday, with third-place Chelsea now just three points ahead of Arsenal with four matches left to play this term. Instead, the German opted to replace Jorginho with midfield colleague Mateo Kovacic at the interval, with wide forwards Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic later introduced at the expense of captain Azpilicueta and ineffective frontman Timo Werner. When quizzed as to why Lukaku did not feature at all against former club Everton, Tuchel insisted he was merely restricted by the number of available substitutions, which will be increased to five per game from next season. He said: “Because we brought Jorginho off. We only had three changes.” ",negative,arsenal,1
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-rob-holding-mikel-arteta-mohamed-elneny-b997441.html,Arsenal: Unlikely heroes emerge as Mikel Arteta’s young side regain control of Champions League battle,"or much of Arsenal’s season their young players have been centre stage, but this recent revival has seen other unlikely protagonists step forward. After losing to Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton, few would have predicted Arsenal would then beat Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham in quick succession. Nor would many have called that the likes of Eddie Nketiah and Mohamed Elneny would be at the heart of those wins. Against West Ham, it was the turn of Rob Holding to emerge as an unlikely hero as he helped Arsenal battle to a 2-1 win. It was not a great performance from the Gunners and even manager Mikel Arteta described it as “ugly”, but they dug deep to grind out the result and no one embodied that gritty effort more than Holding. The centre-back has been on the periphery this season, playing second fiddle to Ben White and Gabriel and essentially taking on the role of defensive super-sub when Arsenal need to see out a game. ‘Smash glass here in case of emergency’, more or less. For this trip to West Ham, however, Holding was given the chance to start due to White being out injured with a tight hamstring. Holding seized his chance, opening the scoring with a header from a corner before throwing his body on the line as Arsenal held on to their slender lead. “The contribution that he (Holding) is having in terms of minutes is not very noticeable, but the contribution he has for the team is huge,” said Arteta. “He needs some praise. “He is someone like Mo [Elneny]. He is the same type of character, same type of person, that is just humble, just wants to give to the team and is happy with the success. When you ask him to play, he is always ready to do it.” It says a lot about the spirit at Arsenal that Holding and Elneny have barely played this season, but have come in and contributed at the most crucial time. Rob Holding and Mohamed Elneny remain crucial for Arsenal despite a lack of regular games Keeping players happy has not always been easy for Arteta but, even if this slimmed down squad has caused him problems, it has also allowed him to create a greater sense of unity. Holding has played his part in that and it is telling that he is a member of the leadership group, despite not being a regular starter. Off the pitch he has a strong influence in the dressing room and is valued by Arteta, acting as one of his trusted lieutenants. Having a strong first XI is naturally crucial to success, but the role of the squad cannot be overlooked and it has caused issues in the past at Arsenal. Holding’s goal and defensive efforts were pivotal in sealing an important win at West Ham The dressing room has not always been the happiest of places, however it is noticeable now how those on the sidelines seem fully on board, even if they only have limited chances to play. “It’s what it’s been like, Ben and Gabi have been great all year and when I’ve had to come on and try and help us secure the three points it’s vital for us, so to play the full 90 and get the three points is even better,” said Holding. Arsenal’s squad clearly needs strengthening and depth added, but, like last summer, making sure the right characters are signed will be key. In Holding, Arteta has someone who emphatically ticks that box. ",positive,arsenal,9

The striker started for the fourth successive match on Sunday, playing a pivotal role as Mikel Arteta’s resurgent side swiftly regained fourth place in the Premier League from rivals Tottenham with a hard-fought 2-1 win at the London Stadium. Along with the likes of Mohamed Elneny and Rob Holding, Nketiah is one of a number of unlikely protagonists now contributing hugely to Arsenal’s push for Champions League qualification despite a previous lack of regular playing opportunities. The 22-year-old’s Arsenal future remains subject to significant doubt, however, with his contract due to expire in June and no agreement yet reached over an extension despite offers having been tabled over recent months. The loss of Nketiah would likely leave Mikel Arteta needing to sign at least two new forwards this summer, with Alexandre Lacazette also seeing his deal expire and admitting he is open to returning to Lyon after holding talks with plenty of clubs. Eddie Nketiah has become an influential part of Arsenal’s push for a Champions League berth And Souness says he is “amazed” by the Arsenal academy graduate’s contract situation, believing he won’t be short of suitors on a potential free transfer after another impressive outing at West Ham. “I thought Nketiah was the best player on the pitch against West Ham,” Souness said on Sky Sports. “He was always threatening. “His contract is about to run out? I’m amazed by that. He will not be short of teams wanting him. He looked a threat throughout and he’s up for the fight. “I really like him and against West Ham, I thought he was fabulous.

The Gunners, however, scored the winner in the second-half as Gabriel headed home at the back post from Gabriel Martinelli’s cross. Simon Collings was at the London Stadium to see Arsenal in action... Aaron Ramsdale 6 Made an excellent save in the first-half when Declan Rice’s header looked destined to go in. Almost caught out in the second-half when he came rushing out to tackle Bowen. Takehiro Tomiyasu 7 A solid game from the Japan international, who was starting his first match since January. Strong in the air and dealt well with Said Benrahma Rob Holding 8 | Star man Into the side for the injured Ben White and had a good game. Opened the scoring with an excellent header and made some vital blocks at the other end. Gabriel 7 Didn’t have a great first-half and looked shaky at times. Improved after the break and got on the scoresheet with a good header. Nuno 5 Just looks so raw and a player clearly still developing. Had some bright moments going forward, but defensively he looks vulnerable. Martin Odegaard 6 Was the best player on the pitch for this game last season, but he was very quiet today. Struggled to get into the game as Rice kept him quiet. Mohamed Elneny 7 Another good performance from the Egyptian, who is relishing his run in the team. Made one or two crucial blocks and tackles. Granit Xhaka 7 The Swiss has been in fine form recently, but he was not quite at his best today. He was still solid enough, especially defensively, but a few loose passes at times. Bukayo Saka 7 Looked like Arsenal’s best weapon in attack and caused Ryan Fredericks plenty of problems down the right. Setup the opening goal from a corner. Eddie Nketiah 7 Bright and lively, as you’d expected, and pressed West Ham’s centre-backs well. Had one or two sights on goal, but couldn’t make them count. Gabriel Martinelli 7 The Brazilian had a quiet first-half as he struggled to get into the game. He improved after the break, though, and setup Gabriel’s goal.

Harry Kane’s goal and a Heung-min Son double ensured Spurs moved above their north London neighbours, at least temporarily, with the Gunners due to play West Ham later in the day. A much-changed Leicester, who are prioritising Thursday’s Conference League semi-final decider against Roma, struck the post early on through Patson Daka but were undone when Kane header home Son’s corner in the first half. After the break, South Korean finished inside the box from substitute Dejan Kulusevski’s pass before curling home a stunning effort from 20 yards to seal an important victory. Kelechi Iheanacho bagged a late consolation for Leicester when his long-range effort range crept inside the near post. Dan Kilpatrick was at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to rate the Spurs players... Hugo Lloris 7 Made a fine fingertip save to turn Daka’s early effort on to the post and quick off his line when needed. Couldn’t keep out Iheanacho’s late strike, which was right in the corner. Cristian Romero 9 A presence at both ends of the pitch in another imposing display. Made the second goal with a magnificent double tackle, the second absolutely cleaning out Caglar Soyuncu. Eric Dier 8 Won some important headers in a calm performance. Coped well with sub Jamie Vardy for the final 25 minutes. Ben Davies 7 Gifted Leicester an early chance in a sloppy moment but solid thereafter. Stepped out of defence well on a couple of occasions. Emerson Royal 5 Tidy and worked hard but failed to make any impact in the final third. He was involved in the build up to Son’s second goal, however. Rodrigo Bentancur 7 Passing was hit and miss, but got struck in and helped Spurs to establish midfield dominance after the interval. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg 7 Used the ball well and was one of Spurs’ better players in the first half, despite a mix-up with Romero leading to Daka’s chance. Might have been clear on goal from Kulusevski’s pass but touch was poor. Ryan Sessegnon 6 Got in some good positions but struggled to make inroads against his opposite man in another difficult outing. Still looked short of confidence. Lucas Moura 4 Back in the XI for the first time since the defeat to Wolves in mid-February, he did nothing to suggest he has deserved more playing time. Never got going and was more liability than threat. Heung-min Son 9 Made the game safe with two second half goals, including a stunning curling finish. Assisted Kane with a near-post corner in a match-winning display. Harry Kane 7 Continued his remarkable record against Leicester with an 18th goal in 17 appearances, a firm header from Son’s corner. Subs Dejan Kulusevski (Lucas 55’) 8 Responded to being rested with an immediate impact from the bench, slipping in Son to double the scoring and setting up his second goal with a simple pass. Harry Winks (Bentancur 81’) 4 Beaten too easily by Iheanacho in the build up to Leicester’s goal. Steven Bergwijn (Son 81’) 6 No repeat of his late heroics at the King Power in a brief cameo.

Tomiyasu made his first Premier League start since January following a lenghty calf problem but was replaced by Cedric Soares after pulling up injured in the 78th minute. Saka, meanwhile, was brought off for Emile Smith Rowe for the final few minutes at the London Stadium and looked to be in some discomfort in the closing stages. Ben White missed the game with a tight hamstring, although it is hoped his problem is not serious. Arteta, who has already lost Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey to injury problems during the run-in, provided a positive update on his players after the game. “Ben got injured against Manchester United, he felt a muscular problem and we checked him, and we will have to assess him in the next few days to see how he is,” he said. “Bukayo was fine, he was really fatigued and he has been through a little injury as well. Tomiyasu has just that he had been out for so long and could not continue.” Arsenal are next in action when they host Leeds United on Sunday, a day after top four rivals Tottenham travel to Liverpool. The two north London heavyweights will then meet on Thursday May 12 in what looks like a straight shootout to determine who qualifies for next season’s Champions League. ",positive,arsenal,1

Pernille Harder coverted a late penalty to claim a hard-fought three points for Emma Hayes’ side, who sit four points ahead of rivals Arsenal, who have only one game in hand. Earlier on Sunday, Arsenal had romped to a 7-0 win over Aston Villa to ramp up the pressure. Vivianne Miedema scored twice with powerful shots in the opening 13 minutes to send Arsenal in at 2-0 up at the break, and an own goal by Rachel Corsie seven minutes into the second half saw Villa crumble. Beth Mead, Lotte Wubben-Moy and Stina Blackstenius all got on the scoresheet before Parris smacked home a 90th-minute penalty to reach a half-century of league goals in the English top flight as the Gunners climbed to 49 points, one behind Chelsea. Arsenal face Tottenham Hotspur, who play Everton later on Sunday, in midweek before finishing their league campaign away to West Ham, while Chelsea meet Birmingham before taking on Manchester United in their final fixture. Manchester United cruised to a 3-0 win over West Ham United to climb back into third place above Manchester City, who thumped Brighton & Hove Albion 7-2 on Saturday. At the bottom of the table, Leicester grabbed a 0-0 draw with Reading for what may prove to be a vital point in the battle against relegation.

Minutes before Gabriel headed in what proved to be a winner, the Arsenal goalkeeper rushed out to sweep up a long-ball played in-behind his defence, to which Bowen got to first. The West Ham star hit the ground after a collision but was booked for diving, although Ramsdale would give him credit during his post-match interview for not protesting further. “He is a good lad,” said the Arsenal stopper. “I didn’t actually touch him at all. He was honest. He jumped straight back up and said, ‘No, no, no. It wasn’t a foul’. Fair play to him.” Moyes, however, suggested there may well have been a chance for Bowen to cause Ramsdale a problem without diving necessarily. “I don’t ever want my players to dive because I just don’t really believe in it,” he said. “I think Jarrod could have easily left his leg there and trailing it into the goalkeeper, maybe he should have. ""It was a reckless challenge by the goalkeeper. The only thing that went for him was it was classed as no contact."" Moyes would also lament some of the decisions that went against his side. “We did a good job against a good team but ultimately we got done on set pieces. We are normally very good on them. “Do you think Holding on the second one heads it with his arm first of all? It looks as if it hits his arm, I don’t think he heads it. That would have been in the same phase of play wouldn’t it? It hits his arm. “They [VAR] can get it wrong sometimes as well, they have got it wrong a lot of times.

Tottenham’s win over Leicester earlier in the day had piled the pressure on Arteta’s side, who kicked-off in fifth place and without key defender Ben White, who missed out with a tight hamstring. In as his replacement, Holding scored the first Premier League goal of his career when he glanced in an opener just after the half-hour mark before Jarrod Bowen’s equaliser. Gabriel would then score a second header as Arsenal saw the game out, moving back above Spurs in a tight Champions League battle. It was another impressive performance from Holding in particular, his second in quick-succession after playing a crucial role in the 4-2 win at Chelsea last month, a result that got Arsenal moving back up the table following a run of three consecutive losses. After the game, Arteta told Sky Sports: “We showed incredible spirit because when we could play the way we wanted to play we had to find a way to play the way they prefer. We adapted. You have to find a way to win all the time to win - forcing mistakes, being brilliant, digging in, clean sheets. “I am really happy, especially for Rob Holding as he hasn’t played the amount of minutes he deserves.

The Gunners had been knocked out of the last Champions League qualification spot by north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur earlier on Sunday after they beat Leicester City. But Arsenal responded to the pressure with a third consecutive victory to give them the edge in what has become a two-horse race for fourth place. After a cagey opening to the contest in which Arsenal enjoyed most of the possession, Rob Holding gave the visitors the lead with a glancing header from a 38th-minute corner. West Ham levelled on the stroke of halftime, however, with Jarrod Bowen’s shot taking a deflection to beat Aaron Ramsdale who moments earlier had saved well from Declan Rice.

They still gave Arsenal a good game, though, and they went in level at the break as Jarrod Bowen cancelled out Rob Holding’s opener.

Aaron Cresswell 6 Asked to fill in at centre-back and did a solid job, especially given he was playing in a two and not a back-three. Ryan Fredericks 5 Had a tough afternoon up against Saka, who skipped past him a few times. Not easy for Fredericks given he had been asked to fill in at left-back.. Mark Noble 6 Unsurprisingly outshone by Rice next to him, who was imperious. Looked a bit leggy at times and occasionally struggled with pace of play.

After a dull opening half an hour, Rob Holding – who once again impressed - scored the first Premier League goal of his career with a glancing header following Bukayo Saka’s corner. From there, the game burst into life. Seconds after Holding’s opener, Aaron Ramsdale pulled off a brilliant reactionary save as Declan Rice’s near-post flick-on flew towards him at break-neck speed. As is becoming customary for this West Ham side, David Moyes’ team were able to feed off a loud home crowd and create their own momentum, with Vladimir Coufal teeing up Jarrod Bowen for an improvised finish to level the scores just before the interval. After the break, the home side started brightly once more. Bowen proved the livewire in the absence of a central striker, although was booked for diving when Ramsdale raced out of his box to sweep up a long ball in-behind the Arsenal defence. With the game finely-poised, a set-piece was likely to be the difference and so it proved when Gabriel Martinelli crossed for compatriot Gabriel Magalhaes to power in what proved to be the winner ten minutes into the second-half. With a corner cleared, Martinelli reacted first and hung up an inviting cross for his teammate to convert with a crushing header at the back post. Eddie Nketiah twice went close to adding a third but this was a game in which Arteta’s side overcame a major hurdle.

Spurs moved back ahead of Arsenal, albeit possibly temporarily, after Son scored twice in the second half, including a stunning effort into the top corner, against a much-changed Leicester. The South Korean’s first-half corner was headed home by Harry Kane — his 18th goal in 17 appearances against his former loan club — and he twice finished passes from substitute Dejan Kulusevski after the break. Kelechi Iheanacho scored a stoppage-time consolation for the Foxes, who made eight changes ahead of their visit to Roma for Thursday’s Europa Conference League semi-final decider. “I gave him a big hug because after an amazing goal my question was, ‘Which is his favourite foot, right or left?’” Conte said of Son, who scored both goals his his supposedly weaker left foot. “He scored a fantastic goal and three minutes before, when I spoke with him, I said, ‘Go for five or six minutes and then I have to make a change’. “So [after the game] I said to him, ‘You listened that I wanted to make a change and you decide to score this amazing goal!’ “We are talking about a great player, a fantastic player. “But it’s important at the end of the season to celebrate a big achievement with the team. Otherwise it remains only a personal success to score these types of goals.” Spurs moved a point clear of Arsenal, with Conte’s side facing Liverpool at Anfield next weekend and Arsenal playing Leeds, before they meet in a potentially decisive north London derby on May 12. Conte added: “It was a good performance against a really good team. “The game wasn’t easy and we knew very well that despite them making eight changes from the last game against Roma you can see the quality, you can see the squad that Leicester has. “For sure we got three points in an important moment of the season especially because in the next games we are going to face first Liverpool and then Arsenal. “Today it was vital to get three points. There is only one result and a lot of pressure, but I said to my players to live this moment, to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months. “I think no one at the start of the season could imagine Tottenham challenging for a place in the Champions League, especially in November when there was a change [of manager] and for this reason we have to be satisfied that we stay in this position to fight for a big achievement.” Conte also hailed Cristian Romero, who was imperious on the right of Spurs’ back three and helped create their all-important second goal - a close range finish from Son. The Argentine won the ball in a crunching 50-50 with Caglar Soyuncu before Kulusevski slipped in Son. “He played a good game,” the Spurs head coach said. “I think every single player played very well. For us it’s very important to do well with the whole team if we want to get three points. It’s no good to play with one, two or three players playing good. We need the whole team playing well and to find a good balance. When this happens we can win the game.” ",positive,arsenal,4

A 1-0 defeat to Everton continued their shaky end of season form and threatens to drag them back towards to Tottenham and Arsenal in the fight for Champions League places. Tuchel criticised his defence for another costly error that gifted Richarlison the winning goal just after half time. But it was a day when his attack let him down once again – even if it required the brilliance of Jordan Pickford to get Everton over the line. Tuchel said: “I said this many weeks ago that I didn’t feel safe and we are never safe. By the way, if we are in a race for top one, top two or top four, no matter what the race, the last four games to only have four points will never be enough, no matter which race we are in. “We have to take care about ourselves. At the moment we don’t get the points when we play well and deserve more and we lose when we play okay. This is a bad mixture.” Cesar Azpilicueta was caught in possession by Richarlison, who fired the winner at the start of the second half. Tuchel has seen his side dominate possession against Manchester United and Everton in the space of three days, yet his team have only managed one goal and one point from those games. He insists the issue is in defence, not attack. “We knew what was coming and like in the last matches we struggled to have clean sheets,” he said. “In the last four we had one, against West Ham, it is the only win we have and I’m very disappointed. “What can I do? The ball is free, give a goal away, it is the worst thing that can happen to you in this atmosphere. It happens too often. We struggle to play without big mistakes and it is why we struggle to have results.” On his attack he added: “If there is something I can do I will try it, but if I knew about it I would have done it before. “For me the key is to have a clean sheet. Manchester United was a different game. More open, fluid. We finally scored late and conceded straight away. “For me this is more like the game against West Ham and we had a clean sheet and played without any big mistakes and that gives us the chance to score late. “If you install emotion and belief in a stadium like this, you struggle.” Everton fans tried to put Chelsea off by setting off fireworks outside the Liverpool Hilton hotel where they stayed on Saturday night. Tuchel said they did not affect him. “I personally woke up twice at 1am and 3am for one minute and after the noise. I turned around and kept on sleeping.” ",positive,arsenal,1

For the majority of a scrappy game, there was little between Spurs and a much-changed Foxes, who are prioritising Thursday’s Europa Conference League decider against Roma, but the hosts’ individual quality told after the break, with Son scoring twice and Romero imperious at centre-half. The South Korean’s second goal was stunning curling effort from the edge of the box to make it 3-0, leaving Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg with his head in his hands, while Harry Kane showed flashes of brilliance and opened the scoring in the first half with his 19th goal in 18 appearances against Leicester. Kelechi Iheanacho scored a stoppage-time consolation for the visitors, who struck the post through Patson Daka at 0-0 but were undone by Son after Brendan Rodgers made eight chances ahead of the trip to Rome. This was not the most polished or convincing display from Antonio Conte’s side but, at this stage of this season, points are the only thing that matter and the win move Spurs one ahead of Arsenal, who face West Ham in the later kick-off. Kane predictability opened the scoring, making it 17 goals in 14 League games against his former loan club, while Son continued to prove that he does not need to be especially involved in games to be the most important player on the pitch. Romero, meanwhile, was outstanding, a class above in everything he did. The Argentine’s ferocious tackling set the tone for Spurs to kick-on in the second half and actually proved an attacking weapon in itself when he won the ball in the crunching challenge on Caglar Soyuncu in the build-up to Son’s all-important second goal. Dejan Kulusevski was also decisive, responding to being rested by coming off the bench and making both of Son’s goals, the first with a clever pass. But Son was really the star, moving ahead of Mohamed Salah for non-penalty goals this season, suggesting he still remains something of an underrated force. Rather than dominating matches, he is increasingly a clutch player in the final third, assisting or scoring when they need a jolt. He set Spurs on their way with a corner for Kane to stoop and score at the near post. If his first goal was a poacher’s finish inside the box, the second goal was inspired, as Son curled into the top corner with his left foot from 20 yards, leaving Kaspar Schmeichel with no chance. This win was an important reminder that while Spurs remain a work in progress under Conte, they have the individuals at both ends of the pitch to win any of their final four matches, even next weekend’s visit to Liverpool, when Kane and Son should relish the space behind the hosts’ high line. A frustration for Conte is that none of his stars had stepped up in the meek displays against Brighton and Brentford, although a Leicester side who are hard-wired to play on the front-foot were also likely to be a more attractive opponent for Conte’s side. While Arsenal are arguably a more well-rounded side than Spurs, further ahead in their development under Mikel Arteta, if this game is anything to go by, Spurs’ individual brilliance and world-class front two could be an important factor in the race for the Champions League.

Just two more needed in as many minutes... 89 mins: Nearly a consolation! Thomas, Castagne, Tielemans all whip in crosses. The third one is the best of the bunch, Vardy gets across his man and flicks the header just wide. 85 mins: Game being played at a snail’s pace down. That is until Spurs give the ball away under no pressure at all. Vardy pounces... Romero swiftly in to win it back. Again. 82 mins: Son will get another ovation, as he’s brought off. Bergwijn on to replace him for the final ten minutes. Conte knows the job is very much done. STUNNING FROM SON! 20 yards out, onto his left foot and it’s curled perfectly into the top corner. Sensational finish and that will be that. 77 mins: Dier briefly down in some discomfort, but he’s back up and fine to continue. Tielemans on for the visitors - hasn’t got much time left to inspire a big comeback. 74 mins: Spurs increasingly sitting back now, letting Leicester have possession. The front three waiting for any chances to counter though - Kulusevski in particularly looks like he has a point to prove. 71 mins: Royal looks to drill it low across the face of goal... Son was completely free at the back post. Cleared behind for a corner. Son takes the corner, Dier wins the header but it’s straight at Schmeichel. ",positive,arsenal,3

After poor results against Brighton and Brentford, Spurs needed a response in their quest for Champions League football. It came in familiar fashion - Harry Kane headed them in front in the first-half, before Heung-min Son fired home his side’s second after the break. Son’s second, and Spurs’ third, came in stunning fashion, as the South Korean curled home a finish into the top corner from 20 yards to cap off a perfect afternoon for the hosts. Kelechi Iheanacho got the visitors on the scoresheet in the dying moments, but any hopes of a comeback had long since gone. It lifts Tottenham back into fourth place in the Premier League, though that will change if Arsenal come away from the London Stadium with three points later on Sunday. Spurs started the better of the two sides but it was a much-changed Leicester side who very nearly took the lead early on as Patson Daka was denied by the woodwork. Cristian Romero then had to make a brilliant interception to stop the Foxes striker having a tap-in at the back post. Despite that strong spell, it was Tottenham who found the opening goal of the match. The Foxes once again were found wanting defending a set-piece, as Son swung in the corner and Kane was there to head home. Spurs’ main man went close to getting his second of the afternoon as he pounced on a loose pass and poked an effort at goal, Kasper Schmeichel doing just about enough to keep it out. After a scrappy start to the second-half, Tottenham took real control of proceedings on the hour mark. Two huge challenges from Cristian Romero set them away, and Dejan Kulusevski then slid the ball through to Son. He turned smartly in the box and fired home with his left foot to double the advantage. Leicester never looked like mounting a comeback but any hopes of one were ended when Son got his second. He picked up the ball, cut inside onto his left and bent a stunning effort into the top corner to put the result beyond any doubt. Iheanacho added a late consolation in stoppage-time, but it did little to dampen the mood on a positive afternoon for Spurs in north London. ",positive,arsenal,1

The quadruple-chasing Reds travel to eastern Spain holding a commanding 2-0 lead in their last-four tie after a Pervis Estupinan own goal and Sadio Mane’s second-half effort in a one-sided first leg at Anfield last week. However, manager Jurgen Klopp is not taking anything for granted on the road to Paris, insisting it is a difficult scoreline as Unai Emery pledged to make his side “suffer” in Tuesday’s return clash. Liverpool followed up that dominant win over Villarreal in which they held 73 per cent of the overall possession and allowed only one shot (which was off-target) by triumphing at Newcastle on Saturday, with Naby Keita’s fourth goal of the season in the early Premier League kick-off ensuring they piled the pressure on title rivals Manchester City, who responded with a routine 3-0 victory at Leeds later in the day to regain top spot with four games to go. Much-changed Villarreal, meanwhile, slumped to a disappointing 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Alaves at the weekend, leaving them seventh in LaLiga, four points adrift of the top six and nine behind Atletico Madrid in fourth. Their hopes of playing in Europe at all next season could well now rest on pulling off an incredible comeback against six-time champions Liverpool and winning the whole competition, with either Real Madrid or Manchester City awaiting the winners of this tie in the final at the Stade de France on May 28. Liverpool vs Villarreal is scheduled for an 8pm BST kick-off on Tuesday May 3, 2022. The match will take place at the Estadio de la Ceramica - better known as El Madrigal - in Villarreal, Spain. TV channel: In the UK, the semi-final second leg will be televised live on BT Sport 2 and BT Sport Ultimate, with coverage beginning at 7pm. Live stream: Subscribers will also be able to watch the match online via the BT Sport website or app. Live blog: You can also follow all the action on the night via Standard Sport’s dedicated match blog. Liverpool will remain without Roberto Firmino on Tuesday, though the Brazilian forward is now back running after nursing a foot issue and is set to travel to Spain with his team-mates. Divock Origi will be assessed after missing the win over Newcastle through non-Covid illness, though Curtis Jones and Kostas Tsimikas are available again. Klopp made five changes in total at St James’ Park, with Mohamed Salah, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ibrahima Konate all moving to the bench. That quintet should return to the starting lineup against Villarreal, though it’s a difficult juggling act with Tottenham visiting Anfield on Saturday evening and the FA Cup Final against Chelsea now less than two weeks away. Mo Salah will return to Liverpool’s starting XI against Villarreal after being rested at Newcastle Klopp is not expecting any players to miss out with a stomach bug that has been in camp of late. Villarreal boss Emery made eight changes of his own against Alaves, with only Samuel Chukwueze, Dani Parejo and Pau Torres retaining their starting berths from Anfield. Former Liverpool full-back Alberto Moreno remains sidelined with a long-term knee injury, but a major boost should come with the return of key striker Gerard Moreno, who sat out the first leg with a hamstring complaint. Raul Albiol and ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin have both shaken off knocks, though Arnaut Danjuma is now struggling with a foot problem after missing training on Monday. Predicted Villarreal XI: Rulli, Foyth, Albiol, Torres, Estupinan, Parejo, Capoue, Coquelin, Lo Celso, Chukwueze, Gerard Predicted Liverpool XI: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Konate, Robertson; Fabinho, Henderson, Thiago; Mane, Salah, Diaz Villarreal’s gameplan totally failed at Anfield, with no shots on target, barely any possession and next to no opportunities to hit on the break. Untroubled Liverpool were entirely comfortable and should unquestionably have won by more as they serenely controlled and dominated proceedings. The wily Emery will have to make big tactical changes for the second leg as they need to put Liverpool under far more pressure from the outset. However, their chances of breaching a mean defence that have now kept four successive clean sheets across all competitions appear slim. Villarreal need to push on and take the initiative in front of their own fans, which will inevitably leave plenty of space in behind for the likes of Salah, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz to exploit. Liverpool to win, 2-0. Villarreal’s only win over Liverpool to date came on home soil back in the first leg of the Europa League semi-finals in 2016, with an injury-time effort from Adrian Lopez. However, the Reds hit back with goals from Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana at Anfield, winning 3-0 to book their place in the Basel showpiece, which they lost to Emery’s Sevilla.

The sorry Red Devils have won just two of their last 11 games across all competitions, a dismal run which continued with a fortunate draw at home to Chelsea on Thursday night. Cristiano Ronaldo saved United a point to keep their faint hopes of a top-four finish alive, although fighting West Ham for a spot in the Europa League appears to be of bigger concern. Those Champions League hopes have surely now been extinguished after Arsenal and Tottenham both won on Sunday, leaving Ralf Rangnick’s side eight points adrift of fourth place, having played a game more than their rivals. They are three points ahead of seventh-placed West Ham, meanwhile. Brentford held Tottenham last time out and could not be blamed for being disappointed with the goalless draw, as it ended a three-game winning run which featured victories over Chelsea and West Ham.

The quadruple-chasing Reds travel to eastern Spain holding a commanding 2-0 lead in their last-four tie after a Pervis Estupinan own goal and Sadio Mane’s second-half effort in a one-sided first leg at Anfield last week. However, manager Jurgen Klopp is not taking anything for granted on the road to Paris, insisting it is a difficult scoreline as Unai Emery pledged to make his side “suffer” in Tuesday’s return clash. Liverpool followed up that dominant win over Villarreal in which they held 73 per cent of the overall possession and allowed only one shot (which was off-target) by triumphing at Newcastle on Saturday, with Naby Keita’s fourth goal of the season in the early Premier League kick-off ensuring they piled the pressure on title rivals Manchester City, who responded with a routine 3-0 victory at Leeds later in the day to regain top spot with four games to go. Much-changed Villarreal, meanwhile, slumped to a disappointing 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Alaves at the weekend, leaving them seventh in LaLiga, four points adrift of the top six and nine behind Atletico Madrid in fourth. Their hopes of playing in Europe at all next season could well now rest on pulling off an incredible comeback against six-time champions Liverpool and winning the whole competition, with either Real Madrid or Manchester City awaiting the winners of this tie in the final at the Stade de France on May 28. Liverpool vs Villarreal is scheduled for an 8pm BST kick-off on Tuesday May 3, 2022. The match will take place at the Estadio de la Ceramica - better known as El Madrigal - in Villarreal, Spain. TV channel: In the UK, the semi-final second leg will be televised live on BT Sport 2 and BT Sport Ultimate, with coverage beginning at 7pm. Live stream: Subscribers will also be able to watch the match online via the BT Sport website or app. Live blog: You can also follow all the action on the night via Standard Sport’s dedicated match blog. Liverpool will remain without Roberto Firmino on Tuesday, though the Brazilian forward is now back running after nursing a foot issue and is set to travel to Spain with his team-mates. Divock Origi will be assessed after missing the win over Newcastle through non-Covid illness, though Curtis Jones and Kostas Tsimikas are available again. Klopp made five changes in total at St James’ Park, with Mohamed Salah, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ibrahima Konate all moving to the bench. That quintet should return to the starting lineup against Villarreal, though it’s a difficult juggling act with Tottenham visiting Anfield on Saturday evening and the FA Cup Final against Chelsea now less than two weeks away. Mo Salah will return to Liverpool’s starting XI against Villarreal after being rested at Newcastle Klopp is not expecting any players to miss out with a stomach bug that has been in camp of late. Villarreal boss Emery made eight changes of his own against Alaves, with only Samuel Chukwueze, Dani Parejo and Pau Torres retaining their starting berths from Anfield. Former Liverpool full-back Alberto Moreno remains sidelined with a long-term knee injury, but a major boost should come with the return of key striker Gerard Moreno, who sat out the first leg with a hamstring complaint. Raul Albiol and ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin have both shaken off knocks, though Arnaut Danjuma is now struggling with a foot problem after missing training on Monday. Predicted Villarreal XI: Rulli, Foyth, Albiol, Torres, Estupinan, Parejo, Capoue, Coquelin, Lo Celso, Chukwueze, Gerard Predicted Liverpool XI: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Konate, Robertson; Fabinho, Henderson, Thiago; Mane, Salah, Diaz Villarreal’s gameplan totally failed at Anfield, with no shots on target, barely any possession and next to no opportunities to hit on the break. Untroubled Liverpool were entirely comfortable and should unquestionably have won by more as they serenely controlled and dominated proceedings. The wily Emery will have to make big tactical changes for the second leg as they need to put Liverpool under far more pressure from the outset. However, their chances of breaching a mean defence that have now kept four successive clean sheets across all competitions appear slim. Villarreal need to push on and take the initiative in front of their own fans, which will inevitably leave plenty of space in behind for the likes of Salah, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz to exploit. Liverpool to win, 2-0. Villarreal’s only win over Liverpool to date came on home soil back in the first leg of the Europa League semi-finals in 2016, with an injury-time effort from Adrian Lopez. However, the Reds hit back with goals from Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana at Anfield, winning 3-0 to book their place in the Basel showpiece, which they lost to Emery’s Sevilla.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-conte-levy-psg-b997258.html,Tottenham: Crunch talks with Daniel Levy still key to Antonio Conte’s future despite dismissing PSG rumours,"ntonio Conte has again refused to offer guarantees he will be at Tottenham next season, saying his future will only be decided after a meeting with the club at the end of the campaign. On Friday, Conte dismissed reports he had offered himself to Paris Saint-Germain as “fake news” and “lies”, and it was suggested to him at a later briefing that he could put an end to unwanted speculation over his future by committing to Spurs. But Conte reiterated that he was only focussed on the final five games of the season and would sit down with the club -- meaning chairman Daniel Levy and managing director Fabio Paratici -- to find “the best solution” after the visit to Norwich on May 22. The head coach effectively wants guarantees that Spurs can challenge at the top of the Premier League, saying he deserves “much more” than another scrap for fourth place next season, and suggested his future would depend on whether he has the patience to match the time needed to rebuild the squad. “As I said to [the media] a lot of times, at the end of the season we'll speak with the club but with pleasure, in a really good way,"" Conte said. “We'll speak and try to find the best solution for everybody. This has to be clear. “I repeat: don’t forget I like to have ambition, not only to fight for a place in Champions League or a place in the [Europa] League. Honestly, I want to fight for much more. For much more. I think also I deserve to do this. “It will be very important to understand how much time we need to fight for something important [and] if we have the patience to wait because for sure this is a process. “I always say to you that we need time and patience. And we have to understand how much time we need and how much patience we have. We have to understand this and to understand if we can match my opinion and the club's opinion. “I know very well that in England it is not simple [to win]. First of all, to fight for and to try to win the title is not simple. It’s important to understand also how much time we need if our ambition is to fight to win the title.” Spurs are two points behind fourth-place Arsenal ahead of Sunday's visit of Leicester but host the Gunners on May 12 in what could effectively be a play-off for Champions League football. Daniel Levy “If we are very good to [achieve] this target, it will be a great achievement for the club, for me. It would be important,” Conte added. “With our ambitions for the future, it would be very important, because I think that I deserve to try to fight for and to win trophies and to fight for something important, not for only sixth or seventh, eight place, or if you have a fantastic season, fourth place. Only this. “But I repeat this is my ambition and it is important to understand and fully match the ambition at the time that we need it.” Conte is under contract until the end of next season and the deal is understood to not include a break clause. Pushed on why he could not commit to Spurs, he added: “My answer is always the same and my answer is still the same, to have another answer is not useful for anyone. My opinion didn’t change, my thoughts didn’t change, my ambition didn’t change. I am the same. I have a fantastic relationship with all the people who work here, and with Daniel Levy and Fabio Paratici. “What I said in the past was the truth. We are trying do this season in the best possible way and then we will see.” Conte's comments will put more pressure on Levy to promise the back the Italian but the head coach insisted he is enjoying his role and working under the chairman and Paratici. “I repeat I am enjoying a lot to work here, I have a fantastic relationship with all the people who work here and with Daniel Levy our chairman and Fabio Paratici,” Conte said. “For this reason it is right to at the end to have a good meeting, a private meeting, and to try to find the best solution for everybody. “When you start to stay for a good period in a club and you understand the dynamics, you start to know much better the people that work with you, the environment “And for sure I always said that I am enjoying a lot to work in Tottenham, to stay in Tottenham, and to come to the training ground, to breath this atmosphere. I can speak only well about Tottenham, about the club. For a coach, a manager, it is a good opportunity and you can enjoy your work here.” ",positive,arsenal,1

Emma Hayes’ side were not at their best against Spurs but Beth England and Kerr’s goals, either side of Kerys Harrop equalising for Spurs, secured them a vital 2-1 win. It means Chelsea are now four points clear of Arsenal at the top of the WSL with two matches to go, although the Gunners have a game in hand. “They (Tottenham) have taken big points off big clubs this year, so we knew it wasn’t going to be easy,” said Kerr. “They’re a good team so it does feel like a good three points, but any win is an important win now. There are two games to go and we’re just going to grind through. If we get all six points we’re champions.” Chelsea’s win last night has put pressure on Arsenal, who are trying to catch the Blues in the final stretch. They have a game in hand on Hayes’ side, which is next Wednesday when they host Tottenham at Emirates Stadium, but before that they will take on Aston Villa on Sunday. Chelsea, meanwhile, are travelling to bottom of the table Birmingham. “We’re in the title race and fighting to be champions. Last season the team was fighting to get third place,” said Arsenal boss Jonas Eidevall. “It’s much more fun to be fighting for the title and if anyone had told us that before the season we would’ve taken it, so let’s enjoy it.” Arsenal will play before Chelsea on Sunday, kicking off at 2pm and four hours earlier than the Blues in the evening. “We just have to control what we can do and get the three points each game and we’re praying Chelsea slip up,” Beth Mead added.

Richarlison profited from a Chelsea error to secure struggling Everton a 1-0 Premier League win and what could be a precious three points in their bid to avoid relegation at a rocking Goodison Park on Sunday. The home side grabbed the lead a minute into the second half after Cesar Azpilicueta gave up possession under pressure from the Brazilian forward, who harried the Chelsea captain into a mistake before slotting a low shot past goalkeeper Edouard Mendy. Chelsea dominated possession and Frank Lampard’s Everton had to hold on grimly for the final half-hour. They stay in the relegation zone, but move to within two points of Burnley and Leeds with a game in hand. SPONSORED Chelsea remain third with 66 points from 34 games as they bid to qualify for the Champions League. They are six points ahead of fifth-placed Arsenal, but have now played a game more. 56 mins: Richarlison is being a bit of a nightmare for Chelsea with his pace, physicality and drive exemplified by Silva fouling the striker near the corner flag. Gordon has the chance to whip in a good delivery which goes far too deep - and out of play. Chelsea haven’t been up to it and they can hardly complain about going a goal down. Horror mistake from Azpilicueta and it fits with what has been a tetchy performance from him. He’s looked to get into rows all day, when his focus should have been on the job at hand. That mistake was classic example of his mind being elsewhere. 51 mins: A response from Chelsea as Azpilicueta pushes into the box and wins a corner off Gray, who feels him hamstring after that neat lunge. The corner is bundled out of the box before Iwobi sends it long. Are Everton prepared to sit in and hold on for 40-plus minutes, or can they keep up the push for another goal? 49 mins: CHANCE FOR TWO! Everton are flying after that goal and Doucoure bundles the ball to Mykolenko, free on the left... and he fires over! 46 mins: RICHARLISON FOR EVERTON! A horror moment for Azpilicueta, who relinquishes possession far too easily by his own box and the Brazilian doesn’t need a second invitation! The second half gets underway with Kovacic back from injury to replace Jorginho for the visitors. A big 45 minutes for Everton to fight for a vital point, or even a massive win... Tottenham lead against Leicester thanks to a first-half Harry Kane goal in north London. That’s a game you can follow live here. Arsenal are taking on West Ham later this afternoon, with build-up taking place here. Chelsea have enjoyed 75 per cent of possession, which could explain why Everton have run 2.5km more than the visitors.

Premier League result, match stream and latest updates today","ottenham vs Leicester LIVE! Heung-min Son’s stunning goal helped Tottenham get their Champions League hopes back on track with a 3-1 win over Leicester. The South Korean curled a 20-yard effort into the top corner to seal a brace that sees him register his highest tally in a Premier League season, moving to 19 goals - just three behind Mohamed Salah in the race for the Golden Boot. Harry Kane got the ball rolling with his customary goal against the Foxes, heading in a first-half corner for his 19th goal in 18 games against his former loan club. The victory ends a two-game blip and piles the pressure on Arsenal ahead of their game at West Ham as the race for the top four looks increasingly likely to go down to the rearranged north London derby in the penultimate week of the season. It was clear where Leicester’s attention lies, as they made eight changes to the side which drew 1-1 with Roma in the Europa Conference League on Thursday, and they only had a stoppage-time goal from Kelechi Iheanacho to show for their efforts. The pressure is now on Arsenal as Tottenham get their top-four push back on track with a comfortable win. It wasn’t always pretty or polished but individual quality told, specifically Son’s & Romero’s. Having Kulusevski as an impact sub also (perhaps inadvertently) worked very well. Spurs are back into the top four! How long for? That depends on Arsenal later this afternoon... There is the consolation! Tielemans with the assist, Iheanacho with the finish. Just two more needed in as many minutes... 89 mins: Nearly a consolation! Thomas, Castagne, Tielemans all whip in crosses. The third one is the best of the bunch, Vardy gets across his man and flicks the header just wide. 85 mins: Game being played at a snail’s pace down.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-antonio-conte-top-four-b997102.html,Antonio Conte must use squad to freshen up stale Tottenham after pair of blanks,"ntonio Conte’s view of his Tottenham squad can be summed up by a phrase the head coach has used to explain his reluctance to make substitutions. “I look to the bench, then I look back to the pitch!” Conte has remarked to staff. Conte, in short, is not convinced by his options outside his first XI, and the only changes he has made in 12 matches have been forced by injuries at wing-back. Saturday’s frustrating 0-0 draw with Brentford perfectly demonstrated Conte’s unwillingness to turn to his bench. With Spurs needing a goal to match Arsenal’s earlier win over Manchester United, Conte’s first change was centre-half Davinson Sanchez for Ryan Sessegnon in the 74th minute, while he did not introduce Lucas Moura until four minutes from time. Steven Bergwijn remained unused, which was bizarre in the circumstances, particularly given the Dutchman’s heroics in the last meeting with Sunday’s opponents Leicester, who visit north London on the back of last night’s 1-1 home draw against Roma in the Europa Conference League. Substitute Bergwijn scored twice in stoppage-time as Spurs sensationally won 3-2, despite trailing in the 95th minute, at the King Power Stadium in January. There is a view from some at Spurs that Bergwijn being the match-winner that night may not have been entirely in the club’s best interests. His stunning late show effectively ensured it would be a PR disaster to sell him to Ajax in the final week of January, as Spurs were considering, but he has since played just 175 minutes in the League. Clearly, the club might have been better off selling him and doing a late deal for a wing-back or an attacker Conte really rates. The big issue with Conte’s reluctance to use his full squad is that his first XI quickly ran out of ideas and steam in the matches against Brighton and Brentford and, damningly, Spurs go into Sunday having not had a shot on target for over three hours. Graham Potter’s Seagulls may just have established a blueprint with which to stop Conte’s side — specifically, prevent Harry Kane from getting on the ball and deny the England captain, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski space in the final third. For all their encouraging progress under Conte, Spurs are still not much better at creating chances against canny opponents as they were under Jose Mourinho. Their wins over Leeds, Everton and West Ham came against sides who all adopted a gung-ho approach, while the thrashings of Aston Villa and Newcastle came after they had been outplayed in the first half but managed to establish a lead, before picking off an opponent who had to chase the game. Until he can make those signings, establishing a Plan B would be a start, but Conte is committed to his approach and appears reluctant to experiment. Among his options would be a switch to a back-four, with Bergwijn or Moura coming in at the expense of a defender, but this risks Spurs’ defensive solidity, which has remained intact. A more realistic move would be to bring either of the above into the front three and move Kulusevski to right wing-back, where the injured Matt Doherty is a miss, as Conte did for the final few minutes against Brentford. The risk there is that the connection between the midfield two and front three is further disrupted without link-man Kulusevski drifting between the thirds. Adding an extra midfield body in Harry Winks is another possibility. The good news for Conte is that Spurs’ next three opponents — Leicester, Liverpool and Arsenal — all have coaches who prefer their teams to have possession and play on the front foot, which should suit the Italian’s approach of absorbing pressure and attacking the space. Conte, though, cannot continue to rely on opponents playing into his team’s hands if Spurs are to overhaul Arsenal again in the battle for fourth. ",positive,arsenal,3

Canoville, who was invited by the club to join talks with prospective buyers in the takeover race, suggested both Hamilton and Serena Williams should steer clear of involvement. Last week, it emerged both the F1 and tennis stars would pledge futher funds to a bid spearheaded by Sir Martin Broughton. For Canoville, however, Hamilton being an Arsenal fan and the fact Williams has previously said she supports Real Madrid means they should not focus on Chelsea. “Lewis is an Arsenal fan and that’s a fact,” he wrote in a lengthy tweet. “Serena is on record saying she supports Real Madrid”. “I will always support Lewis in everything he does in F1, he is the greatest driver ever in my opinion,” said Canoville. “And, as with Serena, he is a phenomenal icon for black achievement and civil rights. Of Boehly’s bid, the 62-year-old said the La Dodgers co-owner had “won” him over after speaking of his “huge passion for social impact around community outreach”.

That is an indication of how fierce the competition is at City and why, with a year left on his contract, he has refused to commit his future to the club. Pep Guardiola also wants to sign a new centre-forward in the summer. Erling Haaland is his No1 target, and Jesus could leave after five-and-a-half years at the Etihad. Arsenal are among the clubs interested in the Brazilian. Strengthening their forward line is a major priority for Mikel Arteta and he looks an ideal signing for the Gunners. Jesus would tick a lot of the boxes for Arteta. Crucially, at 25, he still has his best years ahead of him. He is hungry and has a point to prove after struggling for regular starts at City. Arsenal specifically targeted young players with room for growth last summer, and the enthusiasm of those signings has spread throughout the squad. Arsenal want to reunite Gabriel Jesus with former Manchester City assistant boss Mikel Arteta Arteta knows Jesus from his time as an assistant at City and is a fan of many of his qualities. He would suit the way Arteta wants to play, as he is technically and tactically astute, versatile, quick and a tireless worker off the ball when pressing the opposition. Those traits would make Jesus an ideal fit for the young forward line at Arsenal, who are missing a proven goalscorer to help take them to the next level. Jesus had scored only three Premier League goals this season, and one since September, before his four goals against Watford at the weekend. But having arrived at City as a central striker, he now operates mostly on the right wing. That would be a different story at Arsenal, who can give him a central role, and that would surely be attractive to him. City are unlikely to stand in Jesus’s way if he want to leave, so if he pushes for a move, then his wish should be granted, especially with only 12 months left on his contract. He would be a good addition for Arsenal, but if their recent sticky run showed us anything, it is that Arteta needs a variety of different options, particularly in attack. Teams have found a way to stifle the Gunners, with Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira openly admitting that pressing Alexandre Lacazette made their attack break down. Jesus would, no doubt, improve Arsenal, but the signing of an additional forward feels necessary to give Arteta tactical flexibility. Players in the mould of Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Tammy Abraham, two strikers scouted by Arsenal over the past year, would fit that brief. Arsenal were particularly keen on Abraham last summer, however, they were unable to shift Eddie Nketiah or Lacazette to make room for him in the squad. The player himself was keen on the move, but could not wait for Arsenal and, ultimately, joined up with Jose Mourinho at Roma. The Gunners could go back for Abraham this summer, but given his fine debut season in Italy, such a deal would likely be too expensive. It is why Calvert-Lewin could emerge as a leading target, not least because Everton may well be relegated. That, combined with a tough season for the striker, would drop his valuation. A reunion with Mikel Arteta could be the solution that suits both Gabriel Jesus and Arsenal A player like that would give Arsenal a different way of attacking; the chance to be direct when short and sharp passing is not working. There could also be space in the team for Jesus, who can play left, right or even off a central striker like Calvert-Lewin. For now, Jesus says he is focused on firing City to Champions League and Premier League glory. Time will tell what happens after that, but a reunion with Arteta could be the solution that suits both the player and Arsenal. ",positive,arsenal,13

The champions romped to a big win over relegation-threatened Watford on Saturday to briefly move four points clear of Liverpool as Gabriel Jesus scored four times in a 5-1 win. With title rivals Liverpool not in action until Sunday against Everton, City were overwhelming favourites to put Watford to the sword at the Etihad Stadium, with a double from Jesus’ edging them 2-0 in front inside 24 minutes. Watford then briefly threatened to make a game of it as French defender Hassane Kamara’s first goal in English football five minutes later brought the visitors to within one of City. However, a stunning strike from Spain international Rodri restored City’s two-goal advantage in the 34th minute before Jesus completed his first Premier League hat-trick early in the second half after converting from the penalty spot. Not done there, the 25-year-old tapped home his fourth in the 53rd minute to complete the rout. City took their foot off the gas from there on in, with Tuesday’s Champions League semi final first-leg against Real Madrid in mind. The comprehensive victory moved champions City on to 80 points from 33 matches played, four clear of Liverpool ahead of Sunday’s Merseyside derby, while Watford head towards relegation, sitting 19th seven points from safety. The visitors would have been fearing the worst on their trip north. Guardiola had won all 10 of his previous meetings with Watford in all competitions, and by an aggregate score of 42-4, before Saturday’s clash. It did not take long for City to get on the scoresheet once again in the Etihad sunshine, as Jesus, who was heavily linked with a move to Arsenal in the British media this week, reminded Guardiola of what he could do with a poacher’s finish just four minutes in. City had more than 83% possession in the first 15 minutes as they controlled proceedings, adding a second through Jesus again, on the end of a sumptuous cross from Kevin De Bruyne. Kamara’s drilled finish offered Watford only a brief reprieve, from what was their own meaningful attempt on goal all match, with Rodri drawing gasps from all around as he rifled his fourth league goal of the season past helpless Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster. There was no slacking off from City, as just 15 seconds into the second half Jesus was fouled by Foster in the area before, after a lengthy VAR check, getting up to slot home from the penalty spot to complete his treble. A familiar source created the fifth and final goal for City as De Bruyne laid the ball across for Jesus to cap a memorable afternoon for the Brazilian.

It had been suggested that the Italian was interested in taking over from Mauricio Pochettino at the French champions this summer, raising the possibility of a job swap that would have seen the Argentine return to north London. Conte’s contract runs until the end of next season but he has repeatedly said he will discuss his future with the club at the end of the campaign, with Spurs currently locked in a battle with rivals Arsenal for fourth place. When asked about the PSG links on Friday, Conte said: “Obviously I think that it's good that other clubs appreciate my work. This is one thing. But the truth is that I don't like when people try to invest news, only to speak, only to create probnlems. “This is not right, not fair for me, for the clubs involved and for my players. “Also because we're really focussed on these five games to get a fantastic result for us. I repeat, this type of situation makes me smile. “But I think that also the people that want to tell something about this have to show respect for all the people involved in this situation, and not invent fake news and tell a lot of lies.” Asked if he had spoken to his players about the reports, Conte added: “In this situation, who works in football - players or managers - know very well that at this point of the season, a lot of fake news starts to go out. “We're working very hard and my players know very well we're very focused. We're speaking a lot about this opportunity. “We have to live this situation with passion, enthusiasm and joy. I repeat, we deserve to stay there and to fight for a place in the Champions League. A place in Champions League is not easy for no one. “To stay there, we need to enjoy this situation. For this reason, I repeat our fans have to stay with us at every moment. Positive and negative moments. “We deserve to fight until the end and have a big push from our fans.” Conte’s Spurs have slipped two points behind Arsenal with five games to play after losing to Brighton and last weekend’s frustrating draw with Brentford. Ahead of Leicester’s visit on Sunday, he issued a rallying cry to his players and supporters to keep pushing in the final five games. “I want to underline that we’re fighting for a target that, at the start of the season, no one could imagine,” Conte said. “Especially in November because when I arrived the situation wasn’t good - otherwise you wouldn’t change the coach. So to arrive with five games to go with the possibility to get this result is a great achievement for us. “So for this reason, we have to face the situation with great enthusiasm because we have nothing to lose and only to earn. “We are doing something special for the situation we faced this season. I spoke with my players and it’s the same with our fans, they have to continue to support us and push us until the end. “We’re living this dream. We have to continue until the end to get a place in the Champions League. It’s right to underline that we are fighting for a target that wasn’t in our mind at the start of the season. “For this reason I want to push everybody at the club to have great enthusiasm, great passion, our fans to stay with us and to back us from the start until the end. “If we reach this target, all the people in Tottenham have to be happy to reach this target and everybody has to be involved to meet this target.” ",positive,arsenal,2

A club statement confirmed the 21-year-old went under the knife in the US on Tuesday morning and is expected to be fit in time for pre-season but will play no part in the run-in as Tottenham look to secure Champions League football. Spurs are currently in fifth, two points behind rivals Arsenal, after being held to a goalless draw by Brentford last weekend and Antonio Conte had been desperate to have Skipp back involved as soon as possible. The midfielder has not played since late January because of the long-standing problem, suffering a setback earlier this month as he attempted to return to outside training. Despite his fitness issues, the England U21 international last week signed a new long-term contract to keep him in north London until 2027. Speaking last week, prior to undergoing surgery, Skipp opened up on his frustrations at seeing what had been a breakthrough campaign derailed by injury. “Come the international break, I had an injection which other players have had in the past and the hope was that the original pain would go but that’s not been the case,” he said. “There’s been various times where I felt like I was I getting there but with the nature of this injury it hasn’t materialised that I’ve come back yet. “It’s been a really frustrating one for me, the most difficult part of it is being in the unknown.” ",negative,arsenal,1

Son suffered a muscle injury in his leg during Wednesday's 2-0 defeat to Chelsea in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at Stamford Bridge. Spurs have five matches before the end of January, with League One Morecambe the visitors in the FA Cup third round on Sunday before the second leg against Chelsea on Wednesday night. They also play European rivals Arsenal, Leicester and Chelsea in the league before the end of the month. “The day after [the Chelsea game], he felt a bit of pain in his muscle, in his leg,” Conte said of Son. “He had a scan and now we have to make the right evaluation from the doctors. He has an injury. I don’t know, but probably he will stay without training sessions until the end of this cycle, for the international break.” In a separate interview with Spurs TV, Conte clarified that Son was expected to be sidelined for around two weeks. The Italian plans to rest Harry Kane against the Shrimps this weekend and rotate his side, but it is unclear who will deputise up front, with Steven Bergwijn, who Conte has previously touted for the role of Kane’s understudy, also injured. “Honestly, Harry played six games in 17 days,” Conte said. “And I think if I have the possibility, I think it’s right to give him a bit of a rest. “Also because after this game, before the international break, we have four games, very difficult games. Chelsea, Arsenal, Leicester and then Chelsea again. It’s always difficult to think, to decide not to start with Harry. But at the same time, in some games if we can take the risk it’s right to take. Heung-min Son was injured during Tottenham’s Carabao Cup defeat by Chelsea “I spoke with Steven today and his feeling is good. He’s improving day by day, step by step. My expectation and the medical department's expectation is to come back very soon. We need to help him. Also we had a problem with Son during the game against Chelsea.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-steven-bergwijn-goal-antonio-conte-b977709.html,Steven Bergwijn’s Lucas Moura ‘Ajax moment’ could be a springboard for the Antonio Conte era at Tottenham,"eep into stoppage time at the King Power, Tottenham were on course for another one of those nights, the kind that has come to typify their season. They had struck the woodwork, had two efforts heroically cleared off the line, missed several more clear-cut chances, yet at the end of it all, were on course to be undone by two Leicester goals that owed much to defensive passivity and misfortune. Sergio Reguilon’s tackle had fallen kindly for Patson Daka to open the scoring, then Japhet Tanganga’s attempted block took James Maddison’s effort past Hugo Lloris after Harry Kane had equalised. An unbeaten start to life under Antonio Conte in the Premier League - the saving grace and great cause for optimism amid a meagre Carabao Cup semi-final defeat and a controversial European exit - was about to go up in smoke. And then came Steven Bergwijn, with a late cameo that evoked memories of Lucas Moura against Ajax, scoring goals in the 95th and 97th minutes to give Spurs a victory that will be celebrated perhaps as much as any in the turbulent years since. The Dutchman, on as a substitute after Maddison’s strike had put the Foxes back ahead, smashed home from close range after Matt Doherty’s effort was blocked, then paid homage to Lucas in the Johan Cruyff Arena with a reverse-finish that slid agonisingly past a stranded keeper so unfathomably late in the day you feared the referee’s whistle might blow before it had time to cross the line. The famous 3-2 in Amsterdam provided the greatest night of Mauricio Pochettino’s era and, at last, Antonio Conte will feel that, in a victory on the road by the same scoreline, his own has its springboard. For were it not for the late drama, this would have been a defeat difficult for the Italian to take not because of his team’s inadequacies, but because of how much they had impressed. Despite starting with a midfield trio that, on paper, possessed about as much flair as a box of Bran Flakes, Spurs produced their most incisive attacking display for some time and could conceivably have scored five by half-time. Much of that owed to an improved performance from Kane and the return of Sergio Reguilon. Having Reguilon back from injury mercifully allowed Conte to call time on his experiment with Doherty as a left-wing-back and his presence made all the difference to Spurs as an attacking force. The Spaniard linked nicely with Kane and Lucas and brought a directness in the final-third that has been lacking during Doherty’s brief stint as deputy, the Irishman forever slowing attacks out of the necessity of checking back onto his right-foot. Earmarked as one of the players who could most benefit from Conte’s arrival, Reguilon’s stock has risen further as understudies have faltered during his absence and if Spurs can bring similar thrust to the opposite flank it will ease the burden on a midfield not blessed with creativity. To his credit, Doherty was much-improved returning to his preferred position on the right as a half-time replacement for the ineffectual Emerson Royal, but a good 45 minutes will have done little convince Conte he is the solution, against a hefty backcatalogue of work that suggests he is not. As for Kane, the Carabao Cup matches against Chelsea had represented a backwards step, after he had looked close to rediscovering his best form when scoring in three successive Premier League games in December. The England captain was a lumbering, peripheral figure stranded on halfway for much of that two-legged tie as Thomas Tuchel’s side held Spurs at arm’s length for the best part of 180 minutes. Given his goalscoring record against Arsenal, he must have been as frustrated as anyone to see Sunday’s derby fall by the wayside, but Leicester have proved even more fruitful opposition over the years and the 28-year-old put those Chelsea regressions behind him with a threatening, domineering display, the spearhead of a Spurs attack that looked as potent as it has all season, particularly before the break. His composed equaliser on 39 minutes came after he had already headed against the bar and been denied by Luke Thomas on the line, and took his tally against the Foxes to 18 in 17 career league appearances. As the clock ticked beyond 90 minutes, though, it still looked like it would be his failure to make it 19 when slid clean-through by Lucas at 1-1 that would prove decisive. That was until deep into stoppage time, when he in turn sent Bergwijn clear to ensure it, in fact, did not matter one jot. ",positive,arsenal,1

SPONSORED Chelsea remain third with 66 points from 34 games as they bid to qualify for the Champions League. They are six points ahead of fifth-placed Arsenal, but have now played a game more. 56 mins: Richarlison is being a bit of a nightmare for Chelsea with his pace, physicality and drive exemplified by Silva fouling the striker near the corner flag. Gordon has the chance to whip in a good delivery which goes far too deep - and out of play. Chelsea haven’t been up to it and they can hardly complain about going a goal down. Horror mistake from Azpilicueta and it fits with what has been a tetchy performance from him. He’s looked to get into rows all day, when his focus should have been on the job at hand. That mistake was classic example of his mind being elsewhere. 51 mins: A response from Chelsea as Azpilicueta pushes into the box and wins a corner off Gray, who feels him hamstring after that neat lunge. The corner is bundled out of the box before Iwobi sends it long. Are Everton prepared to sit in and hold on for 40-plus minutes, or can they keep up the push for another goal? 49 mins: CHANCE FOR TWO! Everton are flying after that goal and Doucoure bundles the ball to Mykolenko, free on the left... and he fires over! 46 mins: RICHARLISON FOR EVERTON! A horror moment for Azpilicueta, who relinquishes possession far too easily by his own box and the Brazilian doesn’t need a second invitation! The second half gets underway with Kovacic back from injury to replace Jorginho for the visitors. A big 45 minutes for Everton to fight for a vital point, or even a massive win... Tottenham lead against Leicester thanks to a first-half Harry Kane goal in north London. That’s a game you can follow live here. Arsenal are taking on West Ham later this afternoon, with build-up taking place here. Chelsea have enjoyed 75 per cent of possession, which could explain why Everton have run 2.5km more than the visitors. The Toffees do lead four shots to three however, and they also boast the only one shot on target from either side. Chelsea lead three to two on bookings. ",positive,arsenal,2

Heung-min Son’s stunning goal helped Tottenham get their Champions League hopes back on track with a 3-1 win over Leicester.

If you’re being generous you’d describe the Brazilian’s display as ‘quiet’. 53 mins: Moura looks to get on the end of a ball through the Leicester defence, goes down under a challenge from Soyuncu. Was he tripped? The Spurs fans think so. The referee doesn’t. On we go. 50 mins: Romero plays the ball into the edge of the box, where Hojbjerg is briefly playing as the central striker.

https://talksport.com/football/1100217/arsenal-transfer-news-lautaro-martinez/,Arsenal to renew interest in Inter Milan star Lautaro Martinez with transfer hinging on Champions League with Man United also keen,"Arsenal have renewed their interest in signing Inter striker Lautaro Martinez. According to The Times, the Gunners are hoping their improved chances of playing in next season’s Champions League could help them in luring the 24-year-old to the Premier League. Martinez has been hugely impressive for the Italian giants this term having scored 21 goals for Simone Inzaghi’s side, which has kept a number of European rivals on alert. This includes Manchester United who could reportedly offer Anthony Martial in exchange. And while Martinez is among the top targets for Mikel Arteta’s side, he’s not the only player whom the Spaniard is after. Gabriel Jesus of Manchester City and Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin are also said to be on the club’s radar as they prepare to revamp their forward line this summer. Arsenal’s hopes of signing Martinez could hinge on their ability to finish the season in the top four. The Gunners are sitting in fourth in the Premier League at present, two points clear of rivals Tottenham, however, with a north London derby just around the corner, talkSPORT host and former Tottenham midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes it’s Spurs who will pip Arsenal to the final Champions League spot.  He told thetalkSPORT Breakfast: “We’ve got to get through Liverpool which is a tough fixture and I’ll be surprised if we get anything from that, but both Arsenal and Tottenham are where they are because they have inconsistent performances. “If we’re talking about winning all of our games between now and the end of the season, we’d be like Chelsea and Liverpool. “We’ll slip up and Arsenal will slip up. We’ve got the north London derby which will be the biggest north London derby in recent times and that is a huge, huge fixture. “I just fancy us, under the lights with the players that we’ve got and the front three that we’ve got. If we step up I think we can turn them over, I really do. “This is a young Arsenal side and credit to them, no one expected them to be where they are and it was a big performance against West Ham and they’re a good young team. “But I think that Spurs have just got a little bit more experience than them and when the pressure’s on, we might just find a way to get it done.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

We are now into May, which means the business end of the year is fast approaching and the race for the Champions League spots is at fever pitch. With Manchester City and Liverpool well clear at the top, there are five more teams in contention for the final two Champions League places plus the Europa League spots, with some massive ties ahead. Most of the sides involved only have four games left, but Manchester United only have two. Here talkSPORT takes a look at the Premier League top-four battle as we approach the end of the campaign…   Chelsea have been in the top four the whole season, and are five points clear of fifth. However, their place in the top four isn’t secure yet and they are going to need a few more results from their last four league games. Thomas Tuchel’s side started the campaign as genuine title contenders, but four wins in 11 saw them drop well behind City and Liverpool. From there, it looked as if the Blues would comfortably seal third, but after defeats to Brentford, Arsenal and Everton, that doesn’t look to be guaranteed yet. Chelsea have had to deal with carnage away from the pitch this season, which would likely mean the Blues will have to cap their spending this summer. So, if they were to miss out on the Champions League, who knows what could happen to the club without that income? In their remaining games, Chelsea face Wolves and Leeds. If they manage to avoid defeat in these fixtures, they should do enough to secure their place in the top four. But a season that had so much promise looks like it will end in slight disappointment. Predicted finish – 3rd Wolves – H – May 8 Leeds – A – May 11 Leicester – H – May 19 Watford – H – May 22  Arsenal have turned it around after a nightmare start that saw them at the bottom of the table after three defeats. Since then, the Gunners have pushed on and they are right in the race for the top four. The North Londoners haven’t played in the Champions League since the 2016/17 campaign, and Mikel Arteta has put his faith in a lot of young and very talented footballers. This group of players have been brilliant for the Gunners, but they lost three games in a row recently against Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton. However, just when things could have turned sour, they managed to beat Chelsea, Man United and West Ham to move two points clear of Spurs. The Gunners still have some massive games to play against the likes of Tottenham and Everton, so Arsenal could yet miss out on a place in the top four. Predicted finish – 5th Leeds United – H – May 8 Tottenham – A – May 12 Newcastle – A – May 15 Everton – H – May 22  Tottenham have had a very odd season but they are still in the race for the Champions League. Spurs started the campaign with Nuno Espirito Santo in charge, but after winning his first three league games, things quickly went wrong and he was dismissed well before Christmas. Antonio Conte arrived as his replacement, and after a solid start in which Tottenham were unbeaten in the league for nine matches, they lost four of their next five, including a 1-0 defeat to Burnley. Things didn’t look great, but on transfer deadline day, Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur arrived from Juventus and have helped turn the season around. Spurs then scored 25 goals in seven league matches, winning six of those. However, they then lost to Brighton and only managed a 0-0 draw against Brentford, which halted their season. But they got back to winning ways on Sunday with a 3-1 victory over Leicester City, so they are back on track. If we look at their remaining fixtures, we can see they still have to play Liverpool and Arsenal. The North London derby against the Gunners could decide who lands that final Champions League spot, but Spurs should still have enough to finish fourth if they turn it on again. Predicted finish – 4th Liverpool – A – May 7 Arsenal – H – May 12 Burnley – H – May 15 Norwich – A – May 22  Man United have had a season to forget – they are out of all the cup competitions and look unlikely to get a place in the top four. The season started with so much optimism after the signings of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho. However, things quickly went wrong, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was dismissed early into the campaign. The Red Devils then brought Ralf Rangnick in until the end of the year as interim manager, but he has never performed that role before and has struggled to get a tune out of this squad. The German has only lost five of his 22 league games in charge but seven draws in that time have cost the Red Devils valuable points, and it looks increasingly likely they won’t finish in the top four. Man United still have to play Crystal Palace and a resurgent Brighton in their last two, but Arsenal and Tottenham have two games in hand on the Red Devils. Therefore, this campaign has the potential to end terribly for the world’s most famous club. Predicted finish – 7th Brighton – A – May 7 Crystal Palace – A – May 22  West Ham have not been outside of the top ten this season and have been as high as third on some occasions. It’s been highly impressive given that David Moyes has a small squad to work with and has one first-team striker in Michail Antonio. The Hammers are also deep into the Europa League, so the fact they have kept up with the likes of Arsenal and Tottenham is commendable, and they should finish in a Europa League spot no matter what. This season has seen the Irons beat the likes of Liverpool and Chelsea but the top four might just be out of their reach. However, given they are in the semi-finals of the Europa League, you would have to make them one of the favourites for that competition, so they could end up in the Champions League anyway. West Ham still have to play Manchester City, so they could still have a big impact on the title race.

At the end of the year, three teams will be relegated from the top flight and into the Championship. Norwich City’s demotion has already been confirmed, but who will join them? Assuming Southampton and Brentford are now safe, the fight to survive is down to four teams. Most sides have four games remaining this season but Everton have five, which could cause heartbreak for some. Here, talkSPORT looks at how the Premier League relegation picture is shaping up as we enter the final weeks of the campaign.   Burnley have been in the Premier League for six seasons and they now look capable of securing a seventh. The Clarets have won three league games in a row to move out of the drop zone and above Leeds United. They have still only scored 31 goals but they have found a way to win games at this crucial stage of the season. It now looks possible they will stay up after Michael Jackson replaced Sean Dyche and the Clarets are unbeaten in his four matches so far. They have what looks to be a favourable fixture list, with Tottenham the only fixture you would think they would struggle to take anything from. The ties against Aston Villa and Newcastle at Turf Moor look huge, and if they can win both of them, Burnley should remain in the Premier League. Predicted finish – 17th Aston Villa – H – 7 May Tottenham – A – 15 May Aston Villa – A – 19 May Newcastle – H – 22 May  Leeds have conceded the most goals in the Premier League (72), one more than Norwich, and because of that, relegation is still a threat. This year has been a struggle for Leeds and they have been in a dog-fight all season. Injuries to key players have exposed their squad and, after heavy defeats to the likes of Liverpool, Everton and Tottenham, Marcelo Bielsa was sacked and replaced by Jesse Marsch. The American made a poor start but the Whites were unbeaten in five. However, they were thrashed by Manchester City at the weekend and are only two points clear of the drop zone. Leeds still have to play Chelsea and Arsenal, while they travel to Brentford on the last day of the season. The Whites also take on Brighton, with the Seagulls in decent form at the moment. Leeds’ recent wins over Norwich, Wolves and Watford looked to have been enough to keep them up. But Burnley’s resurgence means they will probably need at least one more victory from their final four to seal their place in the Premier League next season. Predicted Finish – 16th Arsenal – A – 7 May Chelsea – H – 17 April Brighton – H – 15 May Brentford – A – 22 May  Everton have never been relegated from the Premier League but there is a real danger of that happening this year. Poor decisions have hit the Toffees hard and they are now relying on Frank Lampard to save them. Everton replaced Carlo Ancelotti with former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez, and despite a good start, it was never going to end well, and the Spaniard was dismissed in January. Lampard has arrived in his place and the Toffees are unbeaten in four at Goodison Park, but defeats away from home to Burnley, West Ham and Liverpool have plunged them into deep trouble. At the moment, it is hard to see Everton picking up another point on the road, given they have lost their last seven away fixtures. So, the home games against Brentford and Crystal Palace are huge. Predicted finish – 18th Leicester – A – 7 May Watford – A – 11 May Brentford – H – 15 May Crystal Palace – H – 19 May Arsenal – A – 22 May  Watford are onto their third manager of the season and they hope Roy Hodgson can keep them in the Premier League. The Hornets started well with Emmanuel Dennis impressing, but things turned sour, and Xisco Munoz was sacked and replaced by Claudio Ranieri. The Italian managed just one league win against Man United and was dismissed after a 3-0 defeat to Norwich. Hodgson has tried to sort out the defence and Watford have managed two wins since he arrived, but they have lost five games in a row and are 12 points from safety. The Hornets still have four matches to play and face Chelsea. But the big clash is against Everton. However, they lost to Leeds, Brentford and Burnley, which means an escape is looking very unlikely. Hodgson knows how to keep teams up, but he might have arrived too late to save Watford… Predicted finish – 19th Crystal Palace – A – 7 May Everton – H – 11 May Leicester – H – 15 May Chelsea – A – 22 May  Norwich have been in the relegation zone the whole season, and on Saturday after defeat to Aston Viilla, they were officially relegated. The Canaries have managed five wins but have lost 23 of their 34 games and have conceded 71 goals. Smith tried his best, but an escape never looked likely and they have to reflect on a very disappointing campaign. Norwich were active in the summer transfer market and brought in 11 players, but it wasn’t enough. Smith’s side still have West Ham and Tottenham to face, so there could be a bit more pain for supporters to endure before they can forget about this campaign altogether.

The French centre-back is currently starring for the French club, having arrived on loan from the Gunners at the start of the season. The 21-year-old has been hailed as a ‘future great of French football’ by his current Marseille manager Jorge Sampaoli, with Saliba hugely impressing across his 49 appearances for the club this season, including 34 Ligue 1 starts. His form this term has placed a big question mark over his future, and whether he will return to Arsenal or, like former Gunners teammate and fellow Frenchman Matteo Guendouzi, seal a permanent move to his on-loan side. Saliba is yet to play a competitive game forMikel Artetain more than two years at the club, and has recently called Marseille ‘my club’ – implying he may not be keen on a return to north London. “My wish is to finish the season well, to leave on a good note in case I don’t come back,” Saliba said in a recent interview. “It would be my pleasure to come back no matter what, it’s not as if I know I’m not going to come back, it’s Marseille, it’s my club.” Having helped Marseille to second place in Ligue 1 and a place in next season’s Champions League, Saliba admitted he would love to get a taste of that atmosphere.  He added: “[Playing in] the Champions League with OM? When you see the atmosphere in the Conference League or in Ligue 1, I can’t even imagine what it would be like on a Tuesday or Wednesday evening.” Meanwhile, Arsenal legend Thierry Henry has revealed his confusion and frustration with his former club’s handling of Saliba’s situation. The north London club’s all-time top goalscorer has questioned why the young defender was forced out of the Emirates Stadium before being given a real opportunity in the first team. “They didn’t even let him make a mistake,” the Arsenal legend toldAmazon Primeof his old club’s treatment of Saliba.  “He left before an error. He didn’t even have the chance to compete for his place. “What he is doing here is extraordinary. He was rewarded with a selection for the France team. “At the moment, he belongs to Arsenal, I don’t know where he will end up. We have seen that it was a little difficult for him to express himself on the subject. “What I know is that he could have been in the Arsenal group. I am not Mikel Arteta, but I found it difficult for him.

https://talksport.com/football/1100088/cristiano-ronaldo-age-stats-manchester-united-premier-league/,Cristiano Ronaldo proves that age is but a number as key Manchester United stat emerges following goal against Brentford in Premier League win,"Manchester United have lacked much in the way of success this term, but Cristiano Ronaldo might just be the exception. In a largely disappointing season, the 37-year-old has been one of the few bright spots after completing a move from Juventus last summer and proving to the football world he very much still has it. Given Ronaldo’s age, plenty of pundits suggested the Portugal star might struggle to thrive in the elite environment of the Premier League, but if there’s one thing CR7 enjoys it’s the pressure of proving people wrong. After scoring twice on his second United debut in the 4-1 victory over Newcastle, supporters knew their former hero had not lost any of his sparkle and that’s become abundantly clear in the months since. In fact, there’s even a suggestion that he’s got better since he was last at the club. Ronaldo’s last season at Old Trafford was in the 2008/09 campaign in which the forward racked up 18 goals in 33 Premier League appearances. This term, he’s exceeded that with time to spare. In 29 league appearances, three of which have come from the bench, Ronaldo has already scored 18 times.  With three top flight fixtures remaining, it would take a brave person to bet against Ronaldo exceeding that tally. Of course there’s ongoing speculation about whether the experienced forward will remain at United next term, but regardless of what the future holds, it’s clear that Ronaldo’s Old Trafford legacy is well and truly intact after his hugely successful swansong. With his immediate future in doubt, Piers Morgan made a rather bold call during his appearance on talkSPORT as he called for the player to leave United and move to his beloved Arsenal instead. Speaking ontalkSPORT Breakfast, Morgan said: “When it comes down to money and owners and riches and banking, we’ve got the richest of all of them.  “Stan Kroenkehas got £10billion, he’s married to a woman who has got even more in the Walmart heiress who has £15billion. He’s just bought a ranch for £750million, he can afford to buy a couple of strikers! “Do you know what I’d do if I was Arsenal manager? I’d go in, get Cristiano Ronaldo and put him up front. I’ve had this conversation with him last week. I said ‘come to Arsenal’. “The Arsenal and Manchester United thing is very interesting. On paper, United have far more talented players and far more experienced, talented players but they don’t have the right attitude. “The mental attitude is shocking. Whatever is going on in that club…if they didn’t have Ronaldo in the team they wouldn’t be winning, whereas Arsenal have young, hungry, really promising guys who have a great attitude. People like [Bukayo] Saka, [Emile] Smith Rowe, [Kieran] Tierney and all of these guys.  “That’s what’s encouraging. If you combined the United talent with our mentality then both clubs would be sorted. “I’m not even joking. I’d love to bring Cristiano Ronaldo to Arsenal. If he’s not going to stay at United, I’d take him in a heartbeat. “I watched that game at the weekend and he was the best player on the pitch. “As a striker, when you watch Ronaldo’s movement and his goalscoring record at 37, I’d put Ronaldo at the front and let these kids learn from him.” However, for now it appears he is staying put judging by his most recent celebration at Old Trafford.

United have three games left this term and are now eight points off Arsenal in fourth. It means their Champions League hopes are effectively over but they will still be eager to claim European football for next term. The Red Devils have been in poor form recently and have only won once in their last six league games. Ralf Rangnick needs to put that right as Brentford travel to the Theatre of Dreams. The Bees, who drew with Tottenham last time out, are on a good run and have all but secured safety for next season. This Premier League clash will take place on Monday, May 2. The match at Old Trafford will kick off at 8pm. United beat Brentford 3-1 in January’s reverse fixture thanks to goals from Anthony Elanga, Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford.

https://talksport.com/football/1094930/man-utd-news-paul-scholes-jesse-lingard-premier-league/ ,‘I don’t know why I did it’ – Paul Scholes regrets revealing Jesse Lingard conversation but believes Manchester United have treated the midfielder poorly,"Paul Scholes admitted he regretted revealing his conversation with Jesse Lingard where the midfielder labelled the Manchester United dressing room a ‘disaster’. United have come under fire following their defeats to Liverpool and Arsenal in the space of five days as they look set for their worst Premier League season on record. The club legend made the comments while working as a pundit after the loss to the Gunners, but on reflection felt perhaps he should have kept that conversation private. Scholes told talkSPORT: “I’ve had a little bit of stick for that. I don’t know why I did it! Honestly, sometimes words just come out your mouth. “I have spoken to him since and probably best I don’t tell you what he said.” Scholes also criticised the club for how Lingard has been treated in the recent weeks and months. The midfielder was all set to move from the club in January, before it fell through at the 11th hour. He is out of contract in the summer and looks likely to make a permanent exit from Old Trafford.  Scholes added: “I think Jesse has been treated pretty poorly by the club, to be honest. He was ready to sign for Newcastle at one point and West Ham, right at the end of deadline day and he was told he was going to get more minutes. “That clearly hasn’t happened. He’s deserved a chance. We all saw what he did at West Ham. He’s a really good footballer and can bring goals to a team and with this team playing so poorly as well, for him not to get a chance… I think he’s unfairly treated.” But Scholes admitted there could still be a way back into the Manchester United first-team under new manager Erik ten Hag.  Ten Hag will join from Ajax in the summer and the former midfielder thinks a player like Lingard could flourish under the Dutch manager. “I think he might suit him [Ten Hag] and he might want to keep him,” Scholes said. “We will see what happens. “It’s obvious he never wants to leave Manchester United, and if this manager wants him then why wouldn’t he stay?” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.
