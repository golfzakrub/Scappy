Trevor Francis liked a double arm lift, Christophe Dugarry was a kiss blower and few smiles will ever be as broad as Kevin Phillips’. But for all their grandeur they weren’t legendary celebrators, indeed Mikael Forssell was decidedly understated. When players get it right the celebration can be more memorable than the goal itself, though in truth the it’s a heady cocktail of circumstance and quality which stick in the mind. So we at BirminghamLive have had a go at picking the best goal celebrations in Birmingham City history. They’ve not all derby related honestly but this one takes the Audience Participation award. No sooner had Zigic spooned home the winner and lolloped off to the Tilton, than he was wrestled down in a headlock by Craig Gardner.

Redknapp had steered Blues to safety on the final day with a victory at Bristol City. Fans cavorted in the away end for several minutes when Harry was drawn like a moth to the flame, out came the scarf, the fist pumped and he was suddenly 50 years younger. Those scenes tempted him out of semi-retirement. The midfielder cracked home an equaliser in front of the Tilton and flew up the sideline bellowing defiance. As he got closer to the Villa supporters off came the shirt and the enviable torso rippled. It just about trumped the wagging finger at Wolves a couple of seasons later. Barry Fry took his Blues team to the Terriers on the final day of the 1994/95 season knowing a win would put them back in the second tier. With his back to goal ten yards out Claridge spun and somehow rammed the ball past the entire home defence and set off behind the goal in whirl of arms and legs, similar to the way an octopus would attack the Can-Can. Thankfully he was engulfed by supporters before further embarrassment ensued. The youngster lasered in a daisy-cutter from 20 yards, a goal which was enough to put Chris Hughton’s Blues in the Championship play-offs. He then glided towards the visiting supporters and gave it the old snake-hips routine before being engulfed by team-mates. The boy could move. Clinton hooked it goalwards, Sorensen made a mess and off the Londoner went, fingers planted on lips with the other hand pointing at anyone who’d catch his eye, ending in a good old chest-beat Blues were still fuming about the career threatening injury Kevan Broadhurst had suffered at Villa Park earlier that season. They exacted retribution a few months later with a 2-1 victory sealed by Howard Gayle who raced away from the visitors’ defence and stroked home the decisive goal. He then leaped over the hoardings, climbed the fences and stood there, Messianic-like holding on with one hand, pumping the other as Bluenoses celebrated beneath him. What an image. As soon as Ricky Otto’s cross brushed off Tait’s floppy hair and into the Carlisle net Wembley erupted. It was the most golden of goals. And the celebration was even more memorable. The midfielder turned left and went off to the stands in search of the friends old and new. The shirt was ripped off to reveal the legend suggesting toilet-related activities in relation to Blues’ local rivals. Eight years ago today. Obviously the goal meant everything, it saved Blues from relegation. But it’s the scenes it sparked which stand out.

Seconds later Lee Clark was haring in the other direction and throwing himself into the crowd. Stern John at Millwall in the play-off semi-finals gets an honourable mention in the shirt swinging category. Who put the ball in Arsenal’s net? Who gave Blues fans the proudest day in club history? Oba-Obafem, Obafemi Martens. He swept the ball into the empty goal, shrugged off Nikola Zigic, zigzagged away from his team-mates then flew into a triple flik-flak as Bluenoses kicked down the gates of heaven. A stunning celebration to go with a simple goal. ",positive,wolves,1
https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/five-aston-villa-squad-issues-23838431,The five Aston Villa squad issues Steven Gerrard must sort,"Aston Villa are set for another busy transfer window this summer with plenty of outgoings and several incomings expected. Steven Gerrard will be backed in the market with owners Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens hoping the club can challenge for European football next season. Following a positive January window where the club signed Philippe Coutinho (loan), Lucas Digne and Calum Chambers, the Villa boss wants to add more quality to improve his starting XI. A holding midfielder and more defensive reinforcements are at the top of Gerrard's wish list, while Villa will also target more attacking talent, according to reports. Here are five issues that the Villa head coach must sort this summer. READ MORE: Fresh Carney Chukwuemeka transfer claims emerge amid Aston Villa uncertainty READ MORE: Philippe Coutinho has made feelings clear on Aston Villa transfer WHO WEARS THE ARMBAND? One burning question which fans might not know the answer to until the start of next season, is who will wear the captains armband when the new campaign kicks off in three months time? Gerrard isn't convinced that current skipper Tyrone Mings will keep the captaincy past the end of this season. ""I think it's really important, especially with this group of players,"" Gerrard said of the role of captaincy. ""We took over this group who were two points above a relegation fight. I think what we're looking for in terms of help and support for the group is that we need more leaders. ""We need more people who have perhaps been there and done it, and have that type of experience to come in and support a lot of the young talent we've got within the group. So, for me, I think certain teams, i.e. let's use Man City or Real Madrid who are serial winners... maybe the captaincy is not as important because they've got a manager and a level of players across the board who are world-class or in the main - and maybe the captaincy isn't as vital. ""When you take over a team in 16th and just two places above relegation and you're having passages of periods where you're looking strong and good and you're a little bit inconsistent, it's important that leadership is added to the group. It's important that leadership is retained in the group so, when I decide who's captain at the end of the season, they'll have a very important part to play and a very important role to play because we need to turn this team into a more consistent team."" Gerrard added: ""Ty was really appreciative of the opportunity to continue with the armband when I first arrived. I made it abundantly clear to him first before we put it public that that was what we were going to do. ""We needed time, with my staff, to find out who can lead. Tyrone's in with a good shout [of retaining captaincy next season] without a doubt. We've been happy with what he's given so far. But now's not the right time - with eight games to go - to pick the long-term captain of Aston Villa. ""I'll make a decision on the captaincy at the end of the season, beginning of next season, which is what I said when I was first asked about it [at the unveiling press conference in November]. I think it's always important to get in amongst the group to see what they're like every minute of every day. See who's the glue of the team; see who leads in the right way; see who leads through adversity - not just when the sun's shining. To see who's prepared to go above and beyond; see who sets the right standards on a daily basis. ""We're still working that out and I still won't rule out the option of someone coming in who I know, who's also capable of being in the running for it so it's something I'm really analysing closely now. I'll make a decision some time during pre-season before the [new] season starts."" FIRST XI CHANGES Gerrard is keen to not only bolster his squad in the summer window, but also improve on his current XI. Speaking ahead of the 2-0 win over Norwich, the Villa boss made that point clear. Gerrard said: ""What we’ve done is analyse this squad all the way through and given opportunities to everyone. We would have liked to have given more opportunities to players who have been injured, like Bertrand Traore and Leon Bailey. ""It’s also important that certain individuals are seen. There is a thinking behind a lot of opportunities but I am looking for a more settled team moving forward. ""We will be recruiting for the XI. But it’s important to play the big picture because there is no doubt there will be some people moving on and there will be incomings as well, and it’s important that both are seen. There is a thinking behind it. It’s not me wanting to chop and change and do certain things.""

Both midfielders has been given opportunities to impress Gerrard since he took over in November, though that department of his squad could look a lot different come the start of the new season. Meanwhile, veteran Ashley Young is in talks over signing a new contract and is open to extending his stay at Villa Park. The 36-year-old returned to Villa last summer and signed a one-year contract with the option of a further 12 months. Other players with contracts that are slowly running down are Anwar El Ghazi and Frederic Guilbert. Both players are currently out on loan and are expected to find permanent exits from the club when the window opens in June. COUTINHO AND/OR BUENDIA One criticism that has been fired Gerrard's way in recent weeks is down to his reluctance to give Emi Buendia enough game time to make an impact in games. The Argentine has started just one of Villa's last nine matches, but has still managed to produce two assists in that time. Gerrard told BirminghamLive about the playmaker: ""We’ve got a real strong relationship with Emi, we’re happy that he is here. He’s fighting on a daily basis for more game time, obviously them opportunities have come from the bench of late, but he has started a lot of games initially when I first came in. ""So the challenge is very much there for him when he gets the opportunity, whether that’s from the start or from the side, we’re looking for that creative contribution from him, goals or assists. That’s the best way for him to start winning a starting shirt consistently and deliver and execute and get numbers in the game."" Gerrard added: ""He works extremely hard every day, he’s tenacious and warrior-like in how he goes about it. A lot of our forward players have got to continue trying to keep the crowd in the right place, they have to deliver and execute in the final third, that’s what they get paid to do. But that’s not just at Emi, it’s all of our goal scorers, our wingers, our tens, our attacking players. ""We’ve got a lot of talent in the building but the reality is we’re not scoring enough goals of late, that’s what we’re expecting. We’re expecting them to push and score or create in big moments to put us in a better place in the league."" Asked whether Buendia can play in the same team as fellow playmaker Coutinho, Gerrard replied: ""At certain times, against certain opponents, I have seen it work before. But not in every game, I think they are quite similar, but what you have got is two creative players who are capable of opening the door. ""Where Emi is at, obviously he is a lot younger, he needs to continue to work on certain parts of his game, Phil as well. But there is a big onus on them in terms of creativity and goals because they play in important positions in this team."" Villa head coach Gerrard has also backed Coutinho to rediscover his top form before the season is out. The Brazilian has failed to register a single goal contribution in his last six appearances, but Gerrard wants the 29-year-old to end the campaign on a positive note. Gerrard said: ""They got some real key blocks in on Phil today when he came in from the left he had a couple of opportunities and Norwich have defended them really well. It will click and come back without a doubt. ""He’s got quality and you can see every time he’s on the ball the excitement that he brings. He’s not going to be man of the match and on top of the world every week. ""I thought Emi came on and looked really exciting. We have got two really exciting number 10s at our disposable and we’ve got different types of number 10s. ""Danny Ings played there at moments today and he runs in behind, Leon Bailey is more of a dribbler and ball carrier. We’ve got a lot of talent and a lot of options at the top end of the pitch, but I need them all to be a little bit more ruthless. We want to kill teams more."" THE RIGHT OPTIONS UP TOP? Villa came into the clash with Norwich having lost four of their last five games, and in that time they had only scored two goals, with one of those coming from the penalty spot in the defeat at Wolves. So while Gerrard was pleased to see his side get back to winning ways and amongst the goals, he was keen to stress that a lot more work still needs to happen at Bodymoor Heath. Gerrard told BirminghamLive: ""We want to be unpredictable and have options. We changed the way we played at the beginning because we lost one of our coaches who was around the first-team, he went with part of Dean’s coaching set up so we believe they would have prepared for us to play our normal 4-2-3-1 with two 10s narrow, but we went with our 10s outside the pitch to give a different problem and something for them to think about. ""I want the top end of the pitch to be unpredictable and to have options. I want to have players that can give different problems and make us versatile about how we go about it. The back end of the team has pretty much stayed the same, we’ve had five clean sheets out of nine and two clean sheets in the last two so we’re doing a lot of things right from a defensive point of view."" Asked if he had the attackers available in his squad to carry out what he wants, Gerrard replied: ""Erm... good question. We’re always looking to improve. We want to be as ambitious as we can and I think it’s a collective responsibility to make sure they bring their talent and best version of themselves for us to be more ruthless and score more goals which I think we can. ""We missed too many opportunities today. When we had 2 v 1 or 3 v 2 I would like us to be a bit more ruthless but with more work and more time around these players I’m sure we will.""

https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-transfer-connor-ronan-awards-23844158,Wolves midfielder scoops trio of awards amid increasing transfer interest,"Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder Connor Ronan has won three end-of-year awards at St. Mirren as the Irishman attracts transfer interest from a number of clubs. The 24-year-old has been in terrific form since joining the Scottish outfit on loan at the beginning of the season. He has netted eight goals in all competitions in 30 appearances while also pitching in with assists at key moments. At the club's end-of-year awards ceremony, Ronan picked up the player of the year and social media player of the year gongs for his consistently splendid performances from midfield. He also grabbed the goal of the year award for his sensational long range strike against Hearts in the Scottish Cup in March. TALKING POINTS: Wolves star makes 'difficult' admission about European chances after Brighton defeat REACTION: Wolves star makes 'difficult' admission about European chances after Brighton defeat Saints manager Stephen Robinson has said that he would like to keep Ronan at the club, but he faces competition for the Wolves player's signature. Two other Scottish clubs are said to be interested. Aberdeen have been linked with a move after boss Jim Goodwin signed Ronan while he was still at the club. He has said that ""it is obvious"" that a reunion would be mooted given their familiarity with each other. Hearts also have the player in their sights after seeing what he can do in the Scottish Premiership. The Jambos could entice the player with the promise of European football next season. A surprising name has also been thrown into the mix in the past month, with St. Pauli believed to be interested in signing him. The German outfit are in the hunt for promotion from the second tier and the opportunity to play in the Bundesliga could be too good for Ronan to turn down. ",positive,wolves,3

https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-pedro-neto-premier-league-23841284,Wolves star makes 'difficult' admission about European chances after Brighton defeat,"Wolverhampton Wanderers attacker Pedro Neto admits that it will be ""difficult"" for the team to qualify for Europe next season after suffering a heavy defeat in the Premier League at the weekend. Brighton trounced Wolves 3-0 at Molineux on Saturday. A first-half penalty from Alexis McAllister was followed up by goals from Leandro Trossard and Yves Bissouma after the interval. An impressive first half of the season put Wolves in a great position to finish in the top seven and challenge for European qualification. They even looked capable of potentially posing a serious threat to the top four. HEADLINES: Despair for Bruno Lage after Wolves' damaging defeat to Brighton dents European ambitions REACTION: Bruno Lage slams players for 'watching' Brighton in worst Wolves game A string of bad results has quietened those hopes, however. Bruno Lage's men have won just three times in their last ten Premier League games. There is still a decent chance that the club may qualify for one of Uefa's competitions next season, though. They are just three points behind seventh-placed West Ham with a game in hand, and both the Hammers and Manchester United have been in poor form of late. While Neto admits that their chances have been hampered, he says the team will continue fighting ""to achieve our goals"". In order to do that, the Portuguese believes that the team have to do better in terms of chance creation and finishing in front of goal. “When you have your goals, you want to achieve them. We want European football, we are working to that, but the last three games we were not happy,” he told the club’s official website. “We have to create more, we have to score more goals. We are looking to work on that, finishing the best way. “It was not a happy day for us. The last three games were not what we had in our mind. We have a lot to fight for. It’s becoming difficult but we have to continue to work to achieve our goals. “I understand the frustration of the fans. We are here to fight, to work each day. Things are not happening, but we will continue to work to get the victory in the next game.” ",negative,wolves,4

Alexis Mac Allister opened the scoring with a first half penalty having missed an earlier spot-kick. Leandro Trossard and Yves Bissouma piled on the misery for Wolves after half-time with well taken goals. Wolves have now lost seven of their last 10 Premier League games and missed another opportunity to draw level on points with seventh-placed West Ham. Bruno Lage’s team face Chelsea, Manchester City, Norwich City and Liverpool in their remaining four fixtures. READ:  Bruno Lage slams players for 'watching' Brighton in worst Wolves game What Bruno Lage said ""It was 90 minutes that we didn’t play. We watched Brighton play. ""I don’t understand that when we arrive at this point, with a lot of things to conquer, we appear with a performance like that. It was so disappointing. ""It’s clear to me that when you come to this position, with a lot of things to conquer, we didn’t play. It was our worst performance. The first half was balanced but we conceded two big chances to them - two penalties - from one cross and one long ball. ""When little things come together it makes a massive difference we had a long period where we were playing with one team, now we are playing with players who didn’t start the season with us. The positions are not the same, so the decisions are not the same."" READ: Bruno Lage given nightmare injury blow during Wolves vs Brighton What Graham Potter said ""(It was a) Great effort by the boys, kept a clean sheet, fantastic,"" said Potter, via  SussexWorld . ""The personality of the players, the team, everything about the performance I really liked. ""We have had some good away days this year and that [the Wolves win] was up there. You could see the second half performance was up another level from the first. ""The boys looked hungry to score, enthusiastic to get forward. It was important for us to keep a clean sheet because we didn't want to let them back into the game and I thought we managed the situation quite well. ""(We) Defended when we had to and offered a threat on the way forward, and nice to score three goals."" READ: ‘Unacceptable’ - Wolves fans fume as summer transfer demand sent after Brighton defeat What the fans said Clive Whittall: Maybe Wolves need to sack Bruno Lage now, like Burnley did with Sean Dyche, and get themselves back into Europe in the last four games? Isaac Hobbs: Brings into sharp relief the fact we need at least 4 starting XI players in the door otherwise we’ll be fighting for our lives next season. That shambles may yet be a blessing. Angrier about how we’ve thrown in the towel post-Leeds. James Croft: Lucky we’re as high as we are. Certain players need to be sold. David Gilliver: From the outside looking in, is 8th place not on? Who in the top, 7, should you be finishing above? Andy Wolfie: Not our best performance...hope they can turn this around for the final few games. Bill Bradburn: Far too many losses against lower teams. Up next Wolves will look to get back to winning ways when they travel to Stamford Bridge to take on Chelsea next weekend. ",positive,wolves,8
https://www.football365.com/news/feature-premier-league-worst-xi-leeds-brentford-wolves-newcastle,"Raphinha, Rodrigo among Leeds quartet in Premier League weekend’s worst XI…","Four Leeds players make the worst XI of the Premier League weekend, joined by three Wolves, three Bees and a Magpie. It’s a back three for the worst XI according to WhoScored ratings… GK: Illan Meslier – 5.40 The Leeds keeper has been the busiest in the Premier League this season and once again he was exposed by his defence against City. Meslier couldn’t do much about any of the four goals he conceded, even if Gary Neville felt he should have done better with Fernandinho’s strike in added time.  CB: Mads Bech Sorensen – 5.62 One of Brentford’s three centre-backs won only one of the four duels he competed and failed to make a tackle while Manchester United used their last home game of the season to finally look vaguely competent.  CB: Luke Ayling – 5.53 The Leeds skipper lost possession 19 times while being dribbled past six times by a Manchester City player. Ayling also came off second best in eight of the 13 duels he engaged in.  CB: Romain Saiss – 5.59 All of Wolves’ three centre-backs rated lower than 6 in the 3-0 defeat to Brighton, with Willy Boly earning 5.72 and Conor Coady given 5.95. But Saiss scored lowest of the lot after giving away a penalty and losing possession 20 times. The Moroccan attempted 10 long passes, finding a team-mate with none of them.  Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving  RWB: Raphinha – 5.81 Stuart Dallas rated lower on 5.79 but the Cookstown Cafu suffered a serious injury in Leeds’ defeat to City and we’re not monsters. So Raphinha gets the nod after dropping back to right wing-back after Dallas was carried off. The Brazilian lost possession 21 times, failing in both of his attempted dribbles, finding a team-mate with only one of six attempted crosses.  LWB: Rico Henry – 5.18 No tackles, clearances, blocks or interceptions from the Brentford wing-back in the defeat at Old Trafford, where he lost a battle of strength with Cristiano Ronaldo before losing the battle of wits by bundling the Portuguese star to the ground in the box.  MF: Christian Norgaard – 5.92 Seven Brentford starters rated less than six at Old Trafford, with only Henry and Sorensen earning a lower score than Norgaard. The midfielder has made more tackles than anyone else in the Premier League this season but the Dane was quiet at Old Trafford, managing only two tackles before being hooked on 70 minutes. His replacement, Mathias Jensen, earned exactly the same score in his 20-minute cameo.  MF: Leander Dendoncker – 5.83 Ruben Neves got the half-time hook, just when Man Utd turned up to watch the Portuguese, but Dendoncker rated lowest of the Wolves midfielders. The Belgian drifted right before the break in a vain attempt to stop Marc Cucuerella and Leandro Trossard.Dendoncker was sloppy in possession and struggled to get close enough to Brighton to break up their play.  AMF: Joe Willock – 5.84 Jurgen Klopp rotated his midfield at Newcastle but still Liverpool were too strong for the Magpies. Willock was especially quiet, managing only 19 touches while losing possession as often as he found a team-mate with a pass (seven times) before he was replaced with a quarter of the game still remaining.  FWD: Raul Jimenez – 5.80 We usually give substitutes a pass, but Jimenez had the entire second half to make an impact and the Mexican struggled as much as Fabio Silva (5.95). Jimenez failed to attempt a shot on Brighton’s goal and lost possession more times (11) than he found a team-mate with a pass (10).  FWD: Rodrigo – 5.92 The Leeds forward ploughed a lone furrow for 83 minutes but failed to trouble the City defence. The one occasion he escaped Pep Guardiola’s back four, when Aymeric Laporte slipped in the opening minutes, Rodrigo got lost on the half-pitch race to Ederson’s goal, took a touch too many and wasted Leeds’ best chance before City turned the screw.

https://www.football365.com/news/decision-time-one-loanee-dilemma-saliba-van-de-beek?utm_source=Recirculation&utm_medium=WP_Related_Articles_Unit&utm_campaign=Benchmark,Decision time: One loanee per club sparking a dilemma,"A genuinely interminable international break plus a France debut for William Saliba was all the encouragement we needed to embark on a quest to identify one player per Premier League club currently out on loan who, for better or worse, has given his parent club a decision to make… Arsenal: William Saliba The Gunners have a whole gaggle of assorted players out on loan, and, despite the intriguing existence of Folarin Balogun as a striker whose Arsenal contract isn’t about to expire, the most interesting loanee is once again William Saliba. He was here last year and if anything the intrigue has only grown. He has now had three hugely successful years as an Arsenal player; he just hasn’t spent any of them at Arsenal. Loans at St Etienne, Nice and now Marseille have even earned him his first caps for France. Friendly caps might not seem all that big a deal, but winning a cap for France as a centre-back is just about the toughest task in the entire sport; Aymeric Laporte found it so difficult he had to become Spanish instead; Ibrahima Konate still hasn’t managed it. Saliba, the man apparently surplus to requirements at Arsenal, has done it. He is understandably happy and settled at Marseille, where he plays every game, and a return to Arsenal would mean fighting for a place with Gabriel and Ben White. A lot depends on the player, but with only two years left on the five-year contract Saliba signed as a teenager, Arsenal are now very much at the point where it’s time to sh*t or get off the pot.  Aston Villa: Matt Targett One of many players currently on loan – along with Keinan Davis, Trezeguet, Anwar El Ghazi and Frederic Guilbert – who Villa are seemingly happy to move on permanently in the summer. Targett is key, because it appears relatively straightforward to do a deal with Newcastle that suits all parties while also bringing in a reasonably sizeable transfer fee – something in the order of £15m has been mooted – to help bankroll Steven Gerrard’s ambitious summer masterplan of spending £60m on Kalvin Phillips.  Brentford: Marcus Forss The Finland striker was in the squad for every one of Brentford’s first 23 Premier League games. But he started just one of those, getting off the bench in just six others and never for more than 30-odd minutes. He scored no goals. He went back to the Championship on loan with Hull in January and has managed just a single goal in eight appearances for the Tigers. He’s still got four years left on his Brentford contract; it’s hard to see how he can be part of what will almost certainly again be a Premier League squad next year, but you can also see why he’d be reluctant to leave the security of that long-term contract. Another loan?  Brighton: Kjell Scherpen The Seagulls have 13 players out on loan like some kind of petrodollar superclub. At least one of these will definitely be in the squad next season, surely – striker Deniz Undav who has scored only one league goal fewer for shock Belgian league title contenders Union Saint Gilloise before and after a January sale-and-return move than his new Brighton team-mates have managed to put together in the Premier League. A more interesting one might be giant back-up keeper Scherpen, who might have been doing a more important off-field role in the first half of the season than many realised. Scherpen spent the first half of the season watching Robert Sanchez be very good indeed and is now on loan while Sanchez makes repeated bollocks of things as Brighton’s season threatens to end with the sort of whimper that can have alarming knock-on effects the following year if not addressed. Even if he doesn’t play a single game, Scherpen might be worth keeping around the place.  Burnley: Bailey Peacock-Farrell We’re not spoiled for choice here. It’s a third-choice goalkeeper or a fourth-choice goalkeeper. Let’s go with Peacock-Farrell who is doing a decent enough job in nets for fallen giants Sheffield Wednesday as they look to clamber out of League One. Our main observation is that it doesn’t matter how many games of football he plays or at what level. No matter how high his career goes we will never, ever, ever accept that Bailey Peacock-Farrell is not in fact the name of a rugby player who, after six successful years in Super League, crosses codes to join Bath or whatever and make eight appearances for England in the 15-man game.  Chelsea: Conor Gallagher There is not a single Chelsea player currently on loan at Vitesse, which is perhaps why the whole world currently seems to be desperately trying to spin itself off its axis. It’s just not right or normal, is it? Chelsea do, though, have about a million players out on loan as is customary. Now the whole global unpleasantness is of particular relevance to Chelsea, who may not in fact have any choice to make over who stays or goes or heads out on loan. They may not even exist next season. Probably they will, though. And probably they will get to decide these things. Which means a decision to make on Gallagher, who has been one of the most exciting and enjoyable players in the Premier League this season. We’re big fans of players who get to that level and still seem to visibly enjoy playing the game. Palace would, clearly, dearly love to keep him and you do get a keen sense that this is now someone who needs to be playing regularly. You can’t keep him on the bench, released only for the odd runaround in a Carabao or non-vital European game. He’s tasted regular top-level football now and found it entirely to his liking. At the very least, you’d think he needs to spend another year on loan playing all the football.  Crystal Palace: Luke Plange Palace only have two players currently out on loan and it’s fair to say their summer thoughts might be rather more exercised by what happens next to the player they currently have on loan (see above). Anyway, the two options are a) 23-year-old American Jacob Montes who has spent the entirety of his slightly odd one-year Palace contract pulling up no trees in a pair of half-season loans in the Belgian second division and therefore b) Luke Plange, the teenager whose breakthrough at Derby convinced Palace to make a buy-and-return move in January. Palace have a bit of form for developing Football League talent into Premier League players, but you’d imagine that’s probably a way off yet. A good Championship loan seems the likeliest option next season.  Everton: Moise Kean In theory, he’s still in the first year of a two-year loan at Juventus with an obligation to buy at the end of it. In theory. In reality, Juventus weren’t right sure a while ago and since signing Dusan Vlahovic are less convinced still about the merits of Kean who has scored just four goals in 24 Serie A games this season. All the noise suggests Juventus are looking to get out of the current arrangement and send Kean back to Goodison this summer, an outcome that we have to imagine absolutely nobody else involved wants. So whatever happens next it should be fun to see what comes of it all.  Leeds: Helder Costa In and out of the side at Valencia but has made no secret of the fact he’s happier in Spain and would like to make his move permanent if everyone else is up for it. They probably will be. “I feel better here, I came from a not so good situation (at Leeds). But Valencia have given me the opportunity to relaunch my career and I think this is the ideal place to do that,” Costa toldSuper Sport last year.   Leicester City: Dennis Praet A victim of the Dreaded Metatarsal, which has kept him out of the Torino side for a couple of months at a frustrating time and appears likely now to be a season-ender. The Belgian is apparently happy in Turin and keen to stay, but the Italian side seem keen to use his injury as a means to drive down the agreed £12.5m option price in the current loan arrangement. Reports from the Italian end suggest Torino might favour another loan over an outright purchase but, with just two year left on his Leicester contract, you’d imagine the Foxes would want something more concrete built into that. An obligation that kicks in once a set number of appearances is reached or some such thing. We don’t know. We’re not contract negotiators.  Liverpool: Nathaniel Phillips It’s between Phillips and Neco Williams here. Both will still have three years left on their contracts in the summer. Both are on loan at high-flying Championship clubs. Both have obvious talent. Both face significant top-quality barriers to their first-team progression at Anfield. But it’s Phillips, five years Williams’ senior, for whom the clock is more conspicuously ticking. Phillips did an admirable job in that desperate half-season for Liverpool last year when all their other centre-backs fell over, but is that situation going to present itself again? Should Bournemouth confirm promotion back to the Premier League, and that appears almost certain now given their sizeable cushion in both points and games in hand over third-placed Luton, you’d imagine both player and club might be keen on a more permanent arrangement. Ticklish thing there is that longish contract, half a season of decent Premier League football behind him and apparent absence of any option in his loan contract. What would Liverpool want for him? £15m is a number that has been touted, and if anything you’d be surprised if it was that low really.  Manchester City: Pedro Porro Just the 13 City players currently plying their trade elsewhere at the mo. Spain right-back Porro is perhaps the most interesting of those, currently in the second half of a successful two-year stint in Lisbon with Sporting that has already brought one league title and could yet bring another if a six-point gap to Porto can be overturned. Eight goals and nine assists from 65 games played predominantly at right wing-back are eye-catching numbers.  Manchester United: Donny van de Beek The arrival of a new manager in the summer means all things are a bit up in the air for United’s current loanees, who could suddenly find themselves far more in favour when a new man arrives. We suspect minds have been made up now, though, about Anthony Martial. Van de Beek is an intriguing one, though. Especially if United’s new manager does turn out to be his former Ajax gaffer Erik Ten Hag in spite of Louis van Gaal’s mischief-making. Van de Beek is clearly a talent, but whether he can crack it here remains in some doubt. What is not is that he is yet to be presented with an environment to categorically prove it one way or the other. In hindsight – and, if we’re honest, foresight – packing him off to Frank Lampard’s Everton Circus might not have been a brilliant idea. We’re still really none the wiser about him.  Newcastle: Freddie Woodman If you were loaned out by Newcastle in January then really it’s a pretty clear hint about where your future lies. For Woodman, who played four Premier League games at the start of the season, it’s meant sitting on the bench for promotion-chasing Bournemouth as back-up to Mark Travers. It is the seventh loan of his Newcastle career, and he has one year left on his contract at St James’ Park. At 25, it’s surely time for a permanent move to go and be first choice somewhere even if it means dropping down a tier or two.  Norwich: Todd Cantwell Like Norwich themselves, he’s pretty good at getting into the Premier League but not so good at staying there. With his current loan club Bournemouth set to once again swap divisions with parent club Norwich, the logical conclusion is surely for Cantwell to go back to Norwich and complete what would be the genuinely novel achievement of a third successive promotion from the Championship. Bournemouth do, though, hold the option of making the move permanent and spoiling everything.  Southampton: Dan N’Lundulu Because there is literally nobody else other than a 23-year-old striker who scored two goals in 20 League One appearances across a pair of loans at first Lincoln and then Cheltenham before suffering a season-ending hamstring injury.  Tottenham: Bryan Gil Spurs have seven players out on loan, and with most of them the future looks pretty clear one way or the other. It would be a major surprise were Tanguy Ndombele or Giovani Lo Celso to have futures in north London, which is a shame but also probably for the best. Neither has been missed since January. Jack Clarke was Spurs’ attempt at a moneyball signing and it’s not worked out. Cameron Carter-Vickers is likely to make his loan move to Celtic permanent. Pape Sarr, the teenage midfield sensation bought from and loaned straight back to Metz last summer, will require a decision but not a final one. The suspicion there is that he’ll spend pre-season with Spurs before either being brought into the first-team squad or sent on another loan. Spurs, you’d imagine, would prefer that to be to either a bottom-half Premier League club or ambitious Championship side (let’s face it, it will probably be Norwich) to find out how he goes in English football. But the big decision probably regards Bryan Gil, the skilful yet painfully lightweight Spanish winger who just looked nowhere near the right sort of fit for English football. His current loan in Spain cannot tell us much but he is the one player on the Spurs list where all things are possible. This time next year he could just as easily be a Spurs first-team regular, starring for Valencia in La Liga having joined on a permanent basis, doing bits for Crystal Palace on loan or languishing at Tottenham having subsisted on the occasional Europa night which is no longer an option because Spurs have found some new and absurdly Spursy way to get knocked out. Watford: Philip Zinckernagel The Hornets look to be on to a good thing whatever happens here thanks to Zinckernagel’s Nottingham Forest exploits. He’s scored five goals and laid on nine assists to help Forest into the play-off picture, but it’s his eye-catching displays in Forest’s fabulous FA Cup run that really make you take notice. If Watford stay up, then he has shown he can play at Premier League level. If they go down, then he has shown he can propel a Championship promotion bid. And if Watford go down and Forest go up, then they might be able to sell him for a nice price. Win, win, win. If you ignore the whole ‘relegation’ stuff, which is not a win and frankly a bit of a downer.  West Ham: Conor Coventry Because he’s the only West Ham player currently out on loan. They really don’t have a very big squad. The 22-year-old spent the first half of this season in the lower reaches of the Championship, making 12 appearances – mainly off the bench – for Peterborough, and is now in League One with MK Dons. Has just a year left on his contract at West Ham, for whom he has made three brief appearances off the bench in the League Cup.  Wolves: Adama Traore All appeared sorted when he set off to Barcelona initially on loan with a £29m option to make it permanent in the summer. Four assists in 10 games have gone some way to confirming the suspicion that his end-product stats might improve away from Wolves but there is yet a fly in the ointment thanks to Barcelona’s much-publicised financial problems making that £29m a bit steep for them. Wolves have made it clear that Traore is done at Molineux unless there’s a surprise U-turn on a new contract and even then Wolves may feel he’s burned his bridges. Spurs were keen in January, but might have moved on now. Could get tricky, this. ",positive,wolves,4
https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-premier-league-winners-losers-everton-zaha-arteta-norwich-marsch,"Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature","Everton will do well to remember that ritual again this season. Wilfried Zaha gets praise but Norwich, Watford and Jesse Marsch do not. Winners Everton Any Everton supporter with a proclivity for ritualisation might find these last few weeks of the season particularly taxing. It is basic human nature to superstitiously recreate certain behaviours and practices – wearing a supposedly ‘lucky’ item of clothing or following a specific morning routine – in the hope of capturing that same positive energy. Fans might not be able to control what the players do, but if setting off early morning fireworks outside the opposition hotel, carrying an incredibly tranquil dog aloft through a raucous crowd, noisily welcoming the team bus, playing a game of catch with Richarlison and a flare and hiding the match ball up your jumper during stoppage time preceded a crucial victory over the reigning world and European champions, it might be worth trying again for the last five fixtures. Everton will be petrified of changing anything, considering how long it has taken to stumble upon a formula that works. After three wins and a draw in their opening four games, the longest unbeaten run the Toffees have been on in the Premier League this season is two matches. That surely has to change at some point before the end of the campaign for them to survive. But after watching that gap to safety extend to five points before kick-off on Sunday, Everton finally produced under pressure against Chelsea. It was a dogged, determined performance typified by Jordan Pickford’s brilliance, Yerry Mina’s snide and the industry of Demarai Gray and Richarlison, who combined for the winner. The only negative is that Frank Lampard’s side have two fixtures remaining at Goodison Park in comparison to three more trips away. Stock up on sparklers, prepare the calm canines and wear the baggiest clothes possible for that four-day period in which Brentford and Crystal Palace visit Merseyside, because Everton are 10th in a home table – and bottom, at least three points behind every other team in an away one – for a reason. Everton substance over style earns Lampard huge Chelsea scalp in relegation dogfight  BurnleyWhile there were 5,787 days between the amassing of Michael Jackson’s seven UK number ones, the accrual of ten Premier League points has taken Mike Jackson barely a fortnight. Burnley have won three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since April 2019. That same sequence of results – 2-0 against Wolves, 1-3 at Bournemouth and 2-0 against Cardiff – just so happens to contain the previous instance of the Clarets coming from behind to win away in the league. An Ashley Barnes own goal gifted Eddie Howe’s Cherries a fourth-minute lead but the striker rounded off the scoring early in the second half to complete a fine recovery. Three years later, James Tarkowski handed Watford the advantage after eight minutes by accidentally rebounding a shot into his own net. Barnes was central to their revival again, an inspired substitute for Wout Weghorst with half an hour remaining. It changed the angle and method of attack and Watford could not sustain the pressure. This unorthodox caretaker reign has reignited a fading survival bid but also reinvigorated a squad which looked quietly fractured and bereft. The Clarets have scored six goals in four games since Sean Dyche’s departure, each from different players in Wout Weghorst, Connor Roberts, Nathan Collins, Matej Vydra and now the unlikeliest double act of Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill. That the result effectively relegated Watford, barring a miracle, could have a further uplifting effect on one of the most tightly-knit squads around; seeing the pain of the drop first-hand sharpens the collective focus to avoid it. Burnley are finally on course to do just that. Michael Jackson has only been in charge of Burnley since 15 April and already has more Premier League points (10) than any Watford manager has taken this season (Munoz 7, Ranieri 6, Hodgson 9). — Richard Jolly 🇺🇦 (@RichJolly) May 1, 2022   Wilfried Zaha and Patrick VieiraThe situation could hardly have been managed any better. Patrick Vieira noted that Leeds wanted to have their cake and eat it, targeting Wilfried Zaha and fouling him four times before Kalvin Phillips tarred the Crystal Palace forward with a familiar brush.“For someone who dives so much, he has an awful lot of bruises on his ankles,” his manager said, explaining why Zaha started on the bench against Southampton. There was a time when that would have been an automatic signal of defeat for Palace. Zaha was their talisman, without whom they had little hope of operating functionally. He remains integral but this is a solid side that is adorned by his brilliance, rather than solely reliant upon it. Four minutes after Eberechi Eze’s equaliser against Southampton, Vieira threw Zaha on for the final half an hour with the express intention of occupying the home defence as a centre-forward – “We put him in the No.9 because of his mobility and the fact he can hold the ball and run in-behind” – and the results were resounding. Southampton are Zaha’s most frequent opponent. He has faced them 20 times. But his last few visits to St Mary’s had ranged from forgettable to a frustrating exhibition of his main weakness. The 29-year-old constantly toes the line and while he crossed the wrong side in rising to the provocation of James Ward-Prowse and being sent off in February 2019, Zaha somehow resisted the temptation to celebrate in the Southampton midfielder’s face upon his sublime stoppage-time winner. This is already the highest-scoring season of his career and it is no coincidence that he no longer feels the burden of constantly having to drag Palace up to his level. Vieira has built a team worthy of their crown jewel.  Jurgen KloppFive changes from midweek delivered a fifth 1-0 win of the Premier League season for Liverpool. The nature of those victories sum up Jurgen Klopp’s impeccable squad management, with each delivered by a different scorer: Naby Keita against Newcastle; Sadio Mane against West Ham in March; Fabinho against Burnley in February; Mo Salah against Aston Villa in December; and Divock Origi against Wolves the prior week. Extend it to all competitions and a sixth 1-0 win came from Diogo Jota’s effort against Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup quarter-finals. It is an enduring testament to both their strength in depth and of character.  RodriOne of the key fulcrums behind Manchester City’s unexpected set-piece dominance has been Rodri. They look far tighter defending free-kicks and corners with the midfielder in place, and much more threatening attacking them with him lurking. Perhaps behind only Ederson, it feels like Rodri is the player Pep Guardiola staked his reputation on the most. For a holding midfielder, his defensive instincts were initially poor and that counter-pressing role often proved beyond his capabilities and speed. There were few more polarising Manchester City players at one point: some saw enough to suggest he could eventually provide the necessary foundation for success, while others feared that dominance of the English game might always be just out of Rodri’s reach. He epitomises Guardiola’s reign in that way, by rising above preconceptions and changing the game to his whim instead of the other way around. His teammates have stood out at certain points, but Rodri has been a model of consistency.  Brighton’s scoutsMarc Cucurella was outstanding. Yves Bissouma was excellent. Moises Caicedo looks like an absolute Premier League natural. Enock Mwepu’s versatility has been a welcome addition to his game. Leandro Trossard has that air of a player who could raise his levels to suit the standard of most teams. Robert Sanchez matched his tally of clean sheets from last season. Those six players were signed for combined fees equivalent to the sales of Benjamin White, Anthony Knockaert and Aaron Mooy over the last two years. It is a neat party trick to master, particularly as it does not rely upon a specific manager, although the influence of an excellent coach undeniably helps the process. “We sold Ben and we’ve managed to improve. That’s the challenge in the Premier League for teams like us.It’s impossible to think you can keep hold of everybody. But we can sell at the right time, at the right price, then carry on trying to improve,” was Graham Potter’s message after the win over Wolves. Acknowledging that role in football’s food chain is important; embracing it is crucial. Marc Cucurella is unbelievably good every time I watch Brighton. So technically proficient on the ball, rounded defensive game, and can run the whole flank for the full 90 — Aaron Moniz (@amonizfootball) April 30, 2022   Cristian RomeroPatson Daka was theamuse-bouche that only intensified Cristian Romero’s appetite for his main course of Turkish affright. The halfway second challenge that directly preceded Heung-min Son’s first goal did not resemble a halfway line clash between hardened centre-halves, only because Caglar Soyuncu was entirely consumed by his counterpart. It was a comprehensive clattering. Tottenham would rise to fourth only temporarily, but even if they do eventually miss out on the Champions League there is solace in Romero’s presence. “The difficulty is, what top players are going to go to Spurs?” Roy Keane asked in January, suggesting that qualification for Europe’s premier competition was a prerequisite for attracting the best talent. Romero disproves that  Mikel ArtetaArsenal are another step closer to the ultimate justification. By the close of the January transfer window, Rob Holding had started four Premier League games and Mo Elneny just one. Eddie Nketiah’s only appearances outside of the League Cup by then had lasted no more than 19 minutes off the bench. Yet Mikel Arteta trusted all three to deliver when the inescapable time came that he had to call upon them. The Spaniard will be mocked and criticised by many onlookers but harnessing that sort of squad harmony is a delicate balancing act that only the two coaches competing for the title have managed better. The excellence of youth has underpinned this Arsenal season – Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli assisting the goals was apropos – but this is far more of a team effort than it ever has been a case of individualism.   Losers NorwichThere are deeper reads to be had on Norwich’s demise, but describing it as inevitable is misleading. In this particular season they had every chance of avoiding relegation, armed with a solid budget and the painful lessons of previous failures, with hindsight showing that other clubs could have been pulled further into danger. They should have had every advantage on Brentford, for example, yet 19 points separate the reigning second-tier champions from last season’s play-off winners. The sale of Emiliano Buendia was both predictable and early, yet the Canaries used neither the windfall nor the time nearly well enough. Most importantly, there was once an understanding and acceptance from the supporters, who long put their faith in the project and were sold The Norwich Way as the only way. That self-funded model has felt like a pre-prepared excuse all season. Other clubs have navigated those financial constraints much more convincingly. And unless the culture indelibly changes, even promotion next campaign will come with an undercurrent of trepidation from three successive top-flight relegations. Stuart Webber and his time have a few mountains to climb, not least in terms of getting supporters back onside.  Watford The feeling at Vicarage Road will be similar, albeit their fate has not been officially confirmed and the route by which it will surely be reached is vastly different. There have at least been suggestions that Watford intend on changing their ways by arming a younger manager with time and patience instead of whittling down the never-ending list of names on the combined Pozzo-Duxbury contacts book. But the jury will not expect to reconvene on that anytime soon. The next challenge will be to retain certain portions of the squad, because for all their flaws this is not a team which should be setting records for consecutive top-flight home defeats. Ismaila Sarr, Joao Pedro and Emmanuel Dennis are among those who have been gradually dragged down by an atrocious defence, despite the opposite being true last season when Xisco Munoz built upon a solid backline to gain promotion. There should be more optimism at Watford than Norwich, even if the Roy Hodgson appointment has been an unmitigated disaster for all involved. But Duxbury in particular will have questions to answer, considering he spent last May painstakingly listing all the mistakes the Hornets had learned from ahead of this season. Same again. Imagine being a #WatfordFC sub today and your manager not believing in you enough to bring you on. I hope for Duxbury’s sake the club aren’t relying on any of those subs for next year. — Rob Ezekiel (@Rob_Ezekiel) April 30, 2022   Jesse MarschIt was notable that Frank Lampard and Jesse Marsch echoed similar lines. The former described Everton’s fans as “the 12th man” and thanked them for helping “get us over the line late in the game”. The latter said that “the best part was the fans’ response” and “there was so much passion and love for the team from the fans”. The Leeds manager did stress that “that isn’t pandering to our fans” but it is a tough balance to strike. He and Lampard have both perhaps visited that well a little too often. But the key difference there is that Everton fans – rightly or wrong – welcomed their boss as the replacement for an unpopular figurehead, while Marsch started at a natural disadvantage due to the nature of Marcelo Bielsa’s relationship with the support. Few could blame him for leaning on that aspect of a 4-0 defeat in which Leeds had their chances. And in truth, they are losers mainly because of the worst possible results elsewhere. That five-game unbeaten run immediately before the Manchester City loss is keeping heads barely above water and a run-in of Arsenal, Chelsea, Brighton and Brentford has its pros and cons. Pandering or otherwise, Marsch and his players will need the fans to be in full voice.  ChelseaJose Mourinho, in combination with Steven Gerrard, successfully tricked the world into forgetting Chelsea led the Premier League table as late as April 2014; it was not only Liverpool who capitulated in that title race. On a far lesser scale, Thomas Tuchel might be accompanying his players on a slow slide down this table. The German ought to be thankful that the league season is both over soon, and will require Arsenal to face Tottenham in its penultimate week. Chelsea sit three points ahead of Arsenal and five above Spurs, all having played the same number of games. But only two of those sides have momentum currently in their favour. The Blues are finding it difficult to generate that and after a run of five consecutive Premier League wins, their form has been: L, W, L, W, D, L. Tuchel increasingly looks incapable of rousing them from this slump and preventing the individual mistakes that continue to undermine any hint of progress. The season could yet end with Wembley glory and Tuchel’s strength at Stamford Bridge thus far has been in managing those one-off games. But his reign will ultimately be measured by Premier League progress and that is a nut he still seems unable to crack.  WolvesThat unavoidable sense of flux has returned. Bruno Lage has completed a hat-trick of three successive Premier League defeats. Wolves emerged from that stuttering August start to establish their Champions League credentials, which were firmly ended by losses to Arsenal, West Ham and Crystal Palace in March. That cushion to 9th and below should be substantial enough to prevent goalless setbacks against Newcastle, Burnley and Brighton doing lasting damage, but it is demoralising for a season that promised so much to deliver so little.  The European semi-finalistsConsidering how delicately those Europa League and Europa Conference League semi-finals are poised, West Ham and Leicester’s respective seasons hang in the balance. Both are without a win in their last four Premier League games, starting from the match after their quarter-final second-leg heroics and bleeding into the final matches of their semi-finals. If either progress then that drop-off will be forgotten but it will be difficult to gather anything tangible from the season if they are knocked out in midweek.  SouthamptonA ludicrous football club. Between December 15 and February 25, Southampton went on a run of one defeat in 10 Premier League games. From March 5 to April 30, that has become a sequence of one win in nine. ",positive,wolves,5

The Three Lions reached the semi-finals in Russia four years ago, only to come up short against Croatia, and reached a final at Wembley Stadium in Euro 2020 before suffering more penalty shootout heartache against Italy. Positive steps are being taken in the right direction, but can a 56-year wait for tangible success be brought to a close in the Middle East and who will be charged with the task of landing major silverware? GOAL takes a look at the hopefuls longing to see their names called. Jordan Pickford.That's all. pic.twitter.com/BKSqEuwXWg Everton keeper Jordan Pickford has been Southgate’s go-to option between the sticks, as he blends shot-stopping ability with impressive distribution off the deck, and appears guaranteed to make the cut if fit. The same could be said for Aaron Ramsdale following his eye-catching campaign at Arsenal, with the 23-year-old another of those that is as comfortable with his feet as he is with his hands. Burnley’s Nick Pope has often been third in line for England and will hope to see that trend continue when some big calls are made ahead of a showpiece event in November. Sam Johnstone is playing Championship football at West Brom this season, but remains in contention, while Jack Butland could surge up the pecking order if a starting berth is retained at Crystal Palace. Etienne Green has been making quite a name for himself at Saint-Etienne in France but he, along with fellow England U21 international Josef Bursik of Stoke, remains one for the future. Alex McCarthy and Fraser Forster have been in and around senior squads before, but would need untimely setbacks to be endured by others in order to see a path clear for them.

Harry Maguire of Manchester United, Manchester City centre-half John Stones, United and Chelsea left-backs Luke Shaw and Ben Chilwell and the versatile Ben White of Arsenal are all expected to get the nod. There is far greater competition at right-back, with Kyle Walker of Manchester City, Liverpool star Trent Alexander-Arnold, Chelsea full-back Reece James and Newcastle new boy Kieran Trippier all competing for one starting berth. Outside of the established elite, Tyrone Mings’ value as a left-footed centre-half could see the Aston Villa man called upon. Conor Coady of Wolves, AC Milan centre-half Fikayo Tomori and Eric Dier and Joe Gomez of Tottenham and Liverpool respectively could figure if fortune favours them. Tariq Lamptey has caught the eye at Brighton, but faces fierce competition in his favoured defensive berth. Recognition may well come for the likes of Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi or Chelsea's Trevoh Chalobah as they continue their development.

Great performance! ❤️ pic.twitter.com/Ea10Hb4P9H There are another eight apparently obvious selections when it comes to midfield berths, with West Ham holding star Declan Rice, talented teenager Jude Bellingham of Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea playmaker Mason Mount and Manchester City youngster Phil Foden the shortest-priced of those. Jack Grealish, as the most expensive player in British football at Manchester City, is another almost guaranteed to secure a ticket, along with Bukayo Saka of Arsenal and Leeds United talisman Kalvin Phillips. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson will hope to have done enough to earn a call from Southgate, while Arsenal starlet Emile Smith Rowe has emerged as another useful creative influence. Conor Gallagher’s impressive loan spell at Crystal Palace has brought him into contention, while Jesse Lingard cannot be ruled out entirely despite struggling for minutes at Manchester United as he will drop into the free agent pool this summer and land himself a move elsewhere. James Maddison may be a key man at Leicester, but other playmakers are ahead of him on England’s depth chart, while the same can be said for Liverpool midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain – a man with 35 caps to his name. Dele Alli will need to produce something special during a loan spell at relegation-threatened Everton to work his way back into favour, while home-grown Chelsea star Ruben Loftus-Cheek is another to have fallen out of favour since figuring in England’s run to the last four at the 2018 World Cup.

He will be involved, though, if untimely injuries are avoided, as will Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling and Manchester United star Marcus Rashford. Jadon Sancho has come back into form at Manchester United, giving him a shot at selection, while Dominic Calvert-Lewin will be hoping to do enough at Everton to prove that he can provide capable cover for Kane. Manchester United's Marcus Rashford remains highly regarded and is expected to make the plane, but his odds of inclusion may take a tumble if the dip in form, which saw him left out of England's March international panel, continues. Jarrod Bowen’s fine form at West Ham has made him flavour of the month, but he will need to maintain his current standards in order to secure a ticket to Qatar. Tammy Abraham has fared admirably in Italy with Roma, while Ollie Watkins remains a handful at Aston Villa, and they could be asked to provide back-up in a No.9 post. Callum Hudson-Odoi needs to be figuring more frequently for Chelsea in order to put himself into contention, Patrick Bamford and Callum Wilson have to shake off injury struggles at Leeds and Newcastle respectively, and Danny Ings must raise his game with Aston Villa in order to add to his three caps. There is little chance of Leicester’s Jamie Vardy being asked to step out of international retirement, but an attacking star may burst onto the scene out of nowhere and stage a late surge for selection within Southgate’s goalscoring ranks.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/noni-madueke-psv-english-teen-star-turned-down-man-utd/k46l9p2jgeep1h1sslkxcs4pc,Noni Madueke: PSV's English teen star who turned down Man Utd,"It is no secret that an increasingnumber of young British footballers are exploring opportunities overseas in a bid to earn first-team minutes atan earlier age. Jadon Sancho has proven trailblazer in this regard, inspiring a number of teenagers to follow the Borussia Dortmund starto the Bundesliga. However, Germany's top -flight is not the only league offering youngsters a chance to progress. In Eredivisie, for example, there is a young English talent aiming to make as big an impact at PSV this season as Sancho did during his breakout campaign atDortmund in 2018-19. That player is Noni Madueke. ""[Sancho] has opened the eyes to other talents,” the 18-year-old forward, who joined PSV from Tottenham in 2018,told Voetbal International. “A year after him, I went from Spurs to PSV. The plan that I had in mind then is now workingout the way I intended it. ""In England, it is very difficult as a young talent to get into the first team, especially at the bigger clubs. The squads are very large andthere is little room for youngsters. They often stay in reserve teams for a long time orare loaned out. ""There is little flow or chance to break through. That is completely different in the Netherlands."" Having taken his first steps into the senior ranks in Eindhoven before Covid-19 brought a premature end to the 2019-20 campaign, Madueke is now set to play a key role for the Dutch giants. Before making the switch from England to continental Europe, Madueke spent the entirety of his youth football career at Tottenham, where he captained the club's Under-16s as well as making his debut for the U18s as a 15-year-old. Having been named Player of the Tournament at the prestigious Sonnenland Cup in Germany in 2017, a number of top clubs began to take notice of his potential. Manchester United made an offer to take him north, while Chelsea and Celtic were also linked with his signature. But it was PSV who won the race, with Madueke keen to ensure he earned first-team football sooner rather than later. ""There are so many young players in first teams at the top levelat PSV orAjax,” Madueke told the Daily Mailof the Eredivisie a year on from his arrival in Eindhoven. ""Players like Frenkie de Jong andall of these guys. Skip skip skip 😌 A post shared by  Noni Tristan Madueke (@nonzinoo10) on Dec 23, 2019 at 10:01am PST ""I thought if I want to get to the first team as quickly as possible, then I have to move from Tottenham and come to PSV. ""As long as I keep doing the things they are telling me, I feel like I’ll reach that first-team level sooneras opposed to if I had stayed at Tottenham."" Despite the prospect of opportunities with the senior side, Madueke has had to work his way through ranks during his two years at PSV. Upon his arrival he was introduced into the U17s squad, but after scoring three goals in as many games in December 2018 he was handed a permanent promotion to the U19s, for whom he netted a further four goals that season. In 2019-20, he took his game to new levels, scoring seven goals and providing eight assists in just 11 appearances for the U19sduring the first half of the campaign. Such returns saw him rewarded with a promotion to the Jong PSV squad, who play in the Dutch second division. In six games, he scored four goals, and by early March he was again changing lockers after officially being named as part of the first-team squad. Having made three substitute appearances earlier in the campaign, Madueke's first senior start came against Groningen on March 8, though that turned out to be PSV's final game of the season before coronavirus forced football in the Netherlands to go into hiding. The England youth international played his part in a 1-0 win, and two days later signed a new contract which will keep him at the club until 2024, despite increased interest from Arsenal, Manchester City, RB Leipzig, Valencia and Wolves since the turn of the year. Done Deal! #2024 🙌🏾 A post shared by  Noni Tristan Madueke (@nonzinoo10) on Mar 10, 2020 at 10:07am PDT Blessed with speed, skill and physicality, Madueke has spent much of his young career playing as a winger or wide forward who cuts inside from the right to either score or create goals. However, new PSV boss Roger Schmidt has arrived at Philips Stadion with a plan to play 4-4-2, meaning if Madueke is to earn more opportunities he must now adapt his game so as to become a central striker. He made the perfect start during pre-season, netting a first-half hat-trick against lower-league SC Verle that included a stunning solo strike to secure him the match ball. ""I'm not surprised. He already scored a lot of goals in training. He feels comfortable up front and doesn't have to be a winger,"" Schmidt toldDe Telegraafafter Madueke's superb display of finishing. ""Noni's timing is often very good and he has a good feeling for free space. ""I'm also very happy with his mentality. He is a good fighterand is capable of reading the situation.""  Former PSV midfielder Tommie van de Leegte is excited by what Madueke can provide in his potential new role, telling Omroep Brabant: ""He's fast and has the capability to trick his opponent. He brings creativity and is very explosive in his actions. That's what PSV needs. ""Yes, he's young, but age doesn't matter to me. He has shown himself inpre-season, so I would give him the chance to prove himself in the big games as well."" Though Madueke was not included in Schmidt's starting line-up for PSV's Eredivisie opener against Groningen on Sunday, he certainly did prove himself after coming off the bench in the second half. The teenager provided two assists to help secure a 3-1 win, and it will surely not be long before he is earning regular starts just over two years since the biggest decision his young career. “I wanted to be in the first team as young as possible, at the age of 17or 18,"" Madueke said 12 months ago. ""At a club like Tottenham that is not feasible –you only come into the picture around the age of 20. ""That is why I chose PSV two years ago and what is happeningnow with all the opportunities I get is exactly what I had in mind at the time. ""My choice has provento be the right one.""

Jurgen Klopp's team head to Spain leading 2-0 as they look to progress to the final of Europe's premier club competition in Paris on May 28 against either Man City or Real Madrid. However, even if Liverpool fail to make it to the French capital, they have still managed to surpass the Chelsea side of 2006/07, whose own Quadruple challenge lasted all the way until May 1 of that campaign before losing to Liverpool in the Champions League semi-finals. And if Liverpool do manage to see off Villarreal on Tuesday, their next leg of the Quadruple will come against Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley on May 14, a repeat of this season's League Cup final, which the Reds won on penalties in February. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, in the race for the Premier League, Liverpool still just a point behind City as we enter the final four games of the season after an impressive unbeaten run in the league saw the champions' seemingly unsurmountable 14-point lead on January 15 evaporate. In total, Liverpool could face a gruelling seven-match schedule in May if they make it through to the final of European Cup at the Stade de France. So, how have other English teams got on when faced with such a daunting challenge, while surely the trophy-laden Liverpool sides of the 80s must have gone close to achieving the feat? And what about some of the great European giants of years gone by? Liverpool fixtures Premier League table As is surely common knowledge by now, no English team has ever won the Quadruple. Prior to this season, the closest any top-flight side had ever got to winning all four major trophies in a single campaign was Chelsea back in 2006/07. Heading into May of that season, Jose Mourinho's back-to-back Premier League champions had already landed the League Cup after beating Arsenal 2-1 at the Millennium Stadium, while they had an FA Cup final date to look forward to with Manchester United, who they were also going toe to toe with in the league. However, the Blues' challenge ended when they lost on penalties to Liverpool at Anfield in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final, while they would also go on to lose their title to United. Manchester United also came close to making history in 2008/09, only to slip up in the semi-finals of the FA Cup when losing 4-2 on penalties to Everton, although they did then get beaten 2-0 by Barcelona in that season's Champions League final in Rome. And, of course, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side have had numerous Quadruple bids as well since the Catalan arrived at the Etihad, the closest being in 2018/19 and last season. However, the former challenge was ended by Tottenham in the Champions League last eight and the latter after a defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals. Liverpool's current quest, though, will last at least until May 3, when the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with Villarreal concludes, meaning their Quadruple campaign will have lasted longer than any other English team's in history. And before you ask, Manchester United's famous Treble-winning season of 1998/99 actually included a League Cup quarter-final loss at Spurs in the December of that campaign. You would have thought Liverpool have come close before, but actually they have not, despite winning the League Cup four years in a row from 1981. It was the FA Cup that ultimately proved to be Liverpool's Achilles' heel in each of those four campaigns, with the Reds never managing to make it past the fifth round, meaning the closest they came was in 1982/83, only for a shock 2-1 home defeat to second division Brighton to end their Quadruple dreams in February. And it was Brighton again in the cup who scuppered the Reds' chances of winning all four trophies in their Treble-winning campaign the following season. Oddly enough, despite Klopp's 'Mentality Monsters' barely losing a game between 2018 and 2020, they never actually came close to winning the Quadruple. In fact, the nearest they came to achieving the feat was in their title-winning campaign of 2019/20, only for a youth side - selected because of a fixture clash with the Club World Cup - to lose 5-0 at Aston Villa in the League Cup quarter-finals to put an end that dream. In the first season in England when four trophies were up for grabs in 1960/61, it was Burnley who came closest before losing to Hamburg in the last eight of the European Cup in March 1961. However, Celtic did manage to accomplish the seemingly impossible in 1966-67 when Jock Stein's 'Lisbon Lions' won it all - the Scottish First Division, League Cup and Scottish Cup, followed by the first European Cup won by a British team after victory over Inter Milan. Well, the first thing to point out here is that up until the 2019-20 season, France, as in England, was the only other country in Europe's top-five major leagues to have an extra cup competition in the form of the League Cup, or Coupe de la Ligue. So that explains why European giants like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus have all never previously won the Quadruple. Paris Saint-Germain did, though, recently come within a whisker of pulling it off under Thomas Tuchel, only to fall agonisingly at the final hurdle. The big-spending Parisians were awarded that season's Ligue 1 title in April based on a points-per-game ratio after the campaign was prematurely curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when the season did eventually resume, PSG beat St Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final on July 24, before edging out Lyon 6-5 on penalties to claim the Coupe de la Ligue the following weekend. Then, when the Champions League also returned in August, Tuchel's team made it all the way to the final for the first time in the club's history, before unluckily losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. All of which shows just what a mountain Klopp and Co still face in order to make history this season...

Paris Saint-Germain did, though, recently come within a whisker of pulling it off under Thomas Tuchel, only to fall agonisingly at the final hurdle. The big-spending Parisians were awarded that season's Ligue 1 title in April based on a points-per-game ratio after the campaign was prematurely curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when the season did eventually resume, PSG beat St Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final on July 24, before edging out Lyon 6-5 on penalties to claim the Coupe de la Ligue the following weekend. Then, when the Champions League also returned in August, Tuchel's team made it all the way to the final for the first time in the club's history, before unluckily losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. All of which shows just what a mountain Klopp and Co still face in order to make history this season...

Eight years after moving to David Moyes's Manchester United from Chelsea, the Spanish number eight appeared to wave goodbye in style. In United's 3-0 win over Brentford on Monday night, Mata rolled back the years to his early Premier League days - who knows if we'll see him in England's top flight again? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mata showed pace, precision and skill that defies his veteran years - linking up with Cristiano Ronaldo frequently in a commanding first-half display. The pair - with a combined age of 71 - showed intricate passing in tight spaces which forced Mata to shoot wide of David Raya's goal - before the duo linked up again for Ronaldo's goal that was ruled out by VAR for offside. Ralf Rangnick recognised how much better United played and perhaps Mata was the cause of that. United had 74 per cent possession of the ball in the first half, with a passing accuracy of 91 per cent. ""That is the reason why we were controlling the game,"" said the German. ""It had to do with the players on the pitch such as Juan, Bruno [Fernandes] and Nemanja Matic."" While players such as Matic have confirmed they will be leaving United this summer, Mata is yet to do so. Rangnick couldn't confirm what the Spaniard will do, but hailed the midfielder's skill and professionalism in equal measure. Premier League table Premier League results Watch Premier League highlights Get Sky Sports ""I don't know [what he will do], he hasn't confirmed that but it's possible [that he will leave]. It was an important night for players who have been here quite a long time. If it was their last game to say farewell like this. ""In the last couple of weeks, he showed how professional he is and how much he loves his game. You can feel and see how much he is a professional player. He almost played like a magician.""Sam Blitz This was Brentford's first defeat with Christian Eriksen in the starting line-up but the Dane was blameless for that at Old Trafford. He was their outstanding performer and one of the best players on the pitch throughout, showcasing that trademark distribution. ""He has been so good, Eriksen,"" said Gary Neville on co-commentary for Sky Sports, before wondering about the player's future in the summer. ""There will be clubs a lot higher up than Brentford looking at him. Manchester United need a new midfield…"" Whether that move will come to fruition is unclear but Eriksen will clearly have options. Despite this being a convincing victory for Manchester United - Brentford were well beaten - the playmaker still created more chances than any player on the home team. It is wonderful to see Eriksen performing at something close to his best. Having proven his fitness and at only 30 years old, there are not many squads that he would not improve. It will be intriguing to find out what he decides to do next. For now, just enjoy him.Adam Bate Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In a World Cup year, the credentials of most of England's regular talent are examined in detail, but none more so than the number one position. Based on Sunday's superhuman display, Gareth Southgate needn't look any further than Jordan Pickford in Qatar - his performance may even be good enough to convince the staunchest of doubters. On a day where Everton's survival bid depended on three points, their goalkeeper was a man mountain. In actual fact, Pickford may have registered not one but two submissions for 'save of the season' - denying both Cesar Azpilicueta and Antonio Rudiger with monumental stops in the second half. ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves,"" said Sky Sports' Graeme Souness. It's difficult to disagree. The Toffees approach to the game was aggressive and that worked to unsettle Chelsea, who were a shade below their level best. Regardless, no player epitomised the game plan more than Pickford, who was dogged and antagonistic from the off. The 28-year-old had to be at his acrobatic best to preserve an all-important clean sheet and coped impressively under some relentless pressure, with Lampard reaffirming why he is so highly thought of on Merseyside: ""Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top level goalkeeping."" In the two Premier League meetings between Everton and Chelsea this season, the England international has managed 14 saves, conceding just once. The result may well be the spark Everton require to pull off a remarkable escape with five games remaining. Needless to say, they will have to exhibit a similar amount of stubbornness in every fixture between now and the end of term if that bid is to be successful.Laura Hunter Everton captain Seamus Coleman: ""That save he came back off the line and parried out was world class, and we see that on a daily basis in training, and that is why he is England's number one - some of the saves were world class.""   Everton boss Frank Lampard: ""Jordan made great saves. They are Chelsea and will have chances, but we had chances as well. Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top-level goalkeeping, I am happy with him and all the players, and all the subs who came on.""   Sky Sports' Graeme Souness: ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves. Some of the saves he's not entitled to get anywhere near them.""   Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp: ""The one to deny Azpilicueta is the save of the season. It was magnificent. We've given Pickford a lot of stick in the past, but he was brilliant."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Rob Holding was a surprise inclusion in Arsenal's team to face West Ham, but he certainly made his mark on the occasion. On a day when Mikel Arteta's side were some way below their fluid best, their stand-in centre-back typified the grit that got them over the line. Holding, starting alongside Gabriel Magalhaes in the absence of the injured Ben White, ensured Arsenal did not miss a player who had started more Premier League minutes than any other this season. He took his goal superbly, rising between two West Ham defenders to flick Bukayo Saka's corner past Lukasz Fabianski, but it was at the other end of the pitch that he truly shone. Shortly before his goal, there was a stunning block to deny the unmarked Manuel Lanzini. It was one of three he made over the course of the 90 minutes - two more than any other player. Holding put his body on the line repeatedly and also made nearly twice as many clearances (seven) as any of his team-mates. He was brave but also smart, positioning himself intelligently to cut out passes and ensure West Ham's forwards rarely threatened. Arteta was delighted by his contribution and talked up his importance in the dressing room - even if he does not get as many opportunities as he would like on the pitch. ""To good people, good things happen,"" said the Arsenal manager in his press conference. ""He's a phenomenal person and when you ask him to come, he's always ready."" With four, nerve-shredding games remaining in a gruelling top-four race, Holding's grit is sure to be needed again. Nick Wright Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tottenham's season has reached a defining stage. The long-awaited north London derby comes after a trip to title-chasing Liverpool, a daunting double before season-ending fixtures against Burnley and already-relegated Norwich. Sunday's victory over Leicester ensured Spurs' destiny remains in their hands ahead of the run-in and provided yet more evidence that Antonio Conte's squad harbours the talent required to complete a task that looked so unlikely when the Italian was appointed. Only Mohamed Salah has more Premier League goals to his name this season than Heung-min Son after the South Korean took his tally to 19 for the campaign in style with Spurs' spectacular third against the Foxes. It came after Son's first-half corner had set up Harry Kane for Tottenham's opener, with the striker ending his five-game goal drought with a clinical stooping header. The rekindling of Kane's goalscoring touch was enhanced by the impact surprise omission Dejan Kulusevski had coming off the bench and setting up both of Son's goals. Spurs' front three are firing - at the perfect time. If Spurs are going to pip north London rivals Arsenal to Champions League football, their front three are going to be crucial. Ahead of a pivotal final four games of the season, the manner of the victory over Leicester should have instilled confidence they can get the job done.Jack Wilkinson Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  North London is chasing. That's what will be at the forefront of Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel's mind after conceding defeat to a team blighted by potential relegation concerns. Perhaps Chelsea legs were tired - a legitimate grievance given they played away at Manchester United three days ago - but their performance was reserved, almost standoffish. Chelsea were far too kind to a side whose desperation could have easily played into their own hands. Chances were spurned, despite a heroic display from Everton stopper Jordan Pickford - over half of Chelsea's attempted shots (11) were off target. And yet there was still no sign of Romelu Lukaku from the bench. Third spot is still the Blues to lose, but both Arsenal and Tottenham are closing in. Stamford Bridge will now be cautiously looking over its proverbial shoulder. Three of Chelsea's six Premier League losses this season have come in their last six games - so is form a problem ahead of an FA Cup final against high-flying Liverpool on May 14? Well, it's clear that a prerequisite of the Chelsea job is silverware - something that Tuchel has previously delivered. But this season threatens to crumble if Chelsea manage to slip out of the top-four race and allow favourites Liverpool to clinch the FA Cup. The latter is the likelier of scenarios, but Chelsea must remain alert. They face Wolves, Leeds, Leicester and Watford in the Premier League run-in; crucially, three of those fixtures are at home. The Blues must draw upon their Stamford Bridge dominance to see them through a tricky patch and ensure they supersede their London rivals in the hunt for a top three finish.Laura Hunter Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Leicester have conceded 14 goals from corners in the Premier League this season, the most of any side, and it once again led to their downfall at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The visitors had started promisingly, with Patson Daka striking the foot of a post from inside the Tottenham area. But against the run of play the hosts took the lead when Harry Kane headed in from a corner, completely unmarked, which spurred them on to a 3-1 victory. Rodgers made eight changes to his side, with their focus firmly on the Europa Conference League semi-finals, yet no matter who they have fielded during this campaign, defending corners has been a constant issue. ""Defending corners has been a problem for us all season - we lack aggression and cuteness. It was so disappointing,"" said Rodgers, whose side have surpassed the most conceded in a single season since Brighton's 16 in 2017-18. ""It is something we will have to look at in the summer through personnel. The mentality to head the ball is missing, it's something we would need to address.""David Richardson Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

On Monday night, the Cottagers thrashed Luton 7-0 at home to clinch the Championship title after they had made automatic promotion safe earlier this month with victory over Preston. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player After spending 13 consecutive seasons in the Premier League between 2001-2014, Fulham's fortunes have been somewhat less stable in recent years, with their last five campaigns ending in either promotion or relegation. No one can question Fulham's bounce-back ability. The pattern is consistent. Relegation woe is followed by the joy of immediate promotion. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  And once again it's only taken the London outfit one season of Championship football to realise their potential as a first-tier club, but questions over their longevity remain. Here we look at how Fulham can ditch their yo-yo past in favour of a sustained run as a genuine Premier League entity. Having won the Championship with a game to spare, Fulham boss Marco Silva will have one eye, or possibly even two, on next season. Fulham seal return to PL Championship table Get NOW TV - save more than 25% Live football on Sky Sports this week In Silva, Fulham have a leader with Premier League knowhow. In both top-flight forays of recent memory, they have been led by managers who lacked such experience. His Premier League win percentage (35.71) may be somewhat underwhelming, but counts for something given his predecessors - Slavisa Jokanovic and Scott Parker - started their respective top-flight campaigns on zero. Fulham have also led the Championship since mid-January and despite suffering a delay to their promotion parade with a few rogue results - notably against Coventry City and Derby County - have known their fate for weeks. Fulham have tried spending heavily with limited success in the past and will need to be shrewd operators in the summer transfer market to ensure they boost their squad in the areas they lack most. This time around, with automatic promotion secure without the need for the play-offs, Fulham are ahead of the competing pack. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  That security may pave the way for player trading earlier in the window and offer any newcomers more time to bed in. Fulham's recruitment policy has been flawed in recent years and relied too heavily at times on loanees. They splurged over £100m on 12 players ahead of 2018/19, before being forced into the January market for a short-term fix in an attempt to save their ill-fated season. A more considered plan of attack, which centres around two or three key targets in specific areas of weakness, as well as some pragmatic fine-tuning to the current squad will provide a better platform for success - this model has been well executed by both Leeds and Brentford over recent seasons. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Aleksandar Mitrovic is undoubtedly Fulham's talisman, although question marks remain over his Premier League suitability. Regardless, Silva appears to know how to get the best out of his record-breaking striker. He is thriving in a settled system guided by Silva's dynamic style. In March, Mitrovic broke Ivan Toney's Championship scoring record by notching his 32nd and 33rd league goals of the season in a win over Peterborough. In Monday night's win over Luton, the 27-year-old broke Guy Whittingham's second-tier record of 42 goals in a single 46-game campaign with his two second-half strikes taking him onto 43 for the season with a game to play. There is a very clear correlation between Mitrovic's bounty and Fulham's fortunes. In 2020/21, the striker scored more international goals for Serbia (7) than he did at club level (4), as Fulham were relegated having only found the net 27 times all season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It's clear that under Silva, Mitrovic has much more potency. He has got better at coming deep and linking play and is much more of a complete forward, registering a further seven assists. It's also no surprise that Fulham possess the league's most abundant provider in Harry Wilson - 19 assists. In order to dictate the outcome of games in the Premier League, Fulham need to figure out a formula that puts their prized asset, who was named Championship Player of the Season, at the centre of the action. Championship winners tend to fare better than play-off winners - although Norwich City remain an exception to that rule. Fulham must therefore harness the momentum gathered from such a successful season and put it to good use in the early part of the new term. Leeds, Wolves and Burnley are all examples of clubs who have won the Championship title in recent years and exhibited staying power in the top-flight by profiting from the promotion wave. This does not last forever - as demonstrated by Sheffield United's second season demise - but could serve to energise a positive start. The same impetus applies to individuals. There will be a void left by teenage sensation Fabio Carvalho - who is set to depart for Liverpool in the summer - but among Fulham's Premier League 2 (Division 2) title-winning youngsters there is a clear abundance of talent to supplement the quality within the first team. The carryover must also extend to Fulham's stellar strike force. If Mitrovic and Wilson can hit the same heights and deliver a comparable amount of firepower in the Premier League, it's entirely reasonable to forecast Fulham's stay in the top tier to extend beyond a single season. Plenty of ifs, buts and maybes, but there are certainly grounds for cautious optimism. Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12598812/who-qualifies-for-europe-how-premier-league-could-have-nine-teams-in-european-competitions-next-season,Who qualifies for Europe? How Premier League could have nine teams in European competitions next season,"The race for Europe is on but which teams make it - and how many - is still to be decided. With the Premier League campaign reaching its climax, we look at: There are seven European spots open to English sides - although that number could rise to nine and the amount of teams in each individual competition can shift. As a basis: However, because this season the FA Cup winner will be either Liverpool or Chelsea, and both those teams look set to finish in the top four, their Europa League qualifying spot for winning the FA Cup will be passed down to the next highest Premier League finisher who doesn't qualify for Europe. Similarly, because Liverpool won the Carabao Cup and are set to finish in the top four, their Europa Conference League qualifying spot from that competition will go to the next highest Premier League finisher without European football. So that means sides which finish sixth and seventh in the Premier League table are in contention for a place in either the Europa League or Europa Conference League next season. Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal would qualify for the Champions League by finishing in the Premier League's top four positions. Tottenham would go into the Europa League, along with Manchester United (who would get in thanks to Chelsea or Liverpool passing on their spot from winning the FA Cup). Seventh-placed West Ham would qualify for the Europa Conference League, thanks to Liverpool's Carabao Cup winner's spot being passed on. Manchester City and Liverpool have pulled clear at the top of the Premier League, and while their battle to win the Premier League title continues, they don't have to worry about Champions League qualification. Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp will still be plotting how to win this year's competition, and could meet in the final, but they already have their places in next season's tournament wrapped up through the league. Meanwhile, the last two spots in the top four are still up for grabs with Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham in contention with four games remaining. However, whatever the outcome, it will be a top-six finish at the very least for Chelsea and Arsenal, who return to European competition after missing out last season. Although not mathematically done yet, Spurs have all but guaranteed a Europa League spot with a nine-point gap between them and seventh-placed West Ham, who have just three matches left to play this season. Antonio Conte's side also have a far superior goal difference to the Hammers. The battle for the final Europa League spot continues between Man Utd and West Ham, while Wolves also have their eyes on finishing seventh and potentially securing a place in the Europa Conference League. If Manchester City or Liverpool win the Champions League they will automatically qualify for the competition's group stages next season. That is irrespective of where they finish in the Premier League table. If they qualify for the competition through two methods - ie: they win it and finish in the top four - there is no extra Champions League spot created for another team to fill and the number of Premier League clubs in next season's Champions League will remain at four. The Premier League could have a maximum of five teams in the Champions League next season, though, if West Ham won the Europa League and finished outside the top four. Winning that competition qualifies them for the Champions League group stages. If Leicester win the Europa Conference League they will automatically qualify for next season's Europa League - another additional European spot. That means, if West Ham and Leicester win their competitions and finish outside the Premier League's top seven there will be nine English sides in European competition next season. The nine sides would be: the top four and West Ham in the Champions League, fifth and sixth place, plus Leicester, in the Europa League, and seventh place in the Europa Conference League. But if Leicester were to win the Europa Conference League and finish seventh - the place set to be rewarded with a Europa Conference League spot - there would be no English side in the Europa Conference League next season, as Leicester would be bumped up to the Europa League. That happened in Spain last season with Sevilla and no La Liga side involved in the Europa Conference League. With Liverpool and Manchester City in the Champions League semi-finals, there's a good chance an English side would win the tournament - but that would have no impact on European qualification, with both sides set to finish in the top four. West Ham are into the semis of the Europa League and an additional Champions League spot is up for grabs if they win that competition. Their Europa Conference League spot for finishing seventh would disappear.Leicester - 10 points off seventh with two games in hand - could be playing European football again next year if they progress from their semi-final and win the Europa Conference League to earn an additional spot in the Europa League. Regardless of any permutation, no side finishing eighth in the Premier League will qualify for Europe, unless they've won a domestic or European cup. Eighth-placed Wolves would be the highest-finishing Premier League team to miss out on European football, although they are just three points behind West Ham and five off Manchester United, with a game in hand on both.

https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/barcelona-priced-out-of-ruben-neves-move_484864.html,Barcelona 'priced out of Ruben Neves move',"The 25-year-old has enjoyed another strong campaign in the heart of the Wolves midfield with four goals and two assists from 29 Premier League appearances for the European hopefuls. Lage's side were at one point challenging for an unlikely Champions League berth, but a drop-off in form has left them outside of the European places in eighth position - three points adrift of West Ham United with a game in hand. Neves now only has two years left on his contract with the Molineux side, and failure to secure a continental spot for the 2022-23 season could tempt the Portugal international into a move elsewhere. Arsenal and Manchester United have both been linked with a swoop for Neves, with the Red Devils understood to have recently sent scouts to watch the midfielder in action for Wolves. Despite the impending arrival of Franck Kessie from AC Milan on a free transfer, Barcelona are also thought to be keen to bring Neves to Catalonia as part of their summer overhaul. © Reuters While Lage has admitted that it may be difficult for Wolves to keep hold of Neves this summer, the Portuguese has insisted that the midfielder is worth at least £100m in the upcoming market. ""These days we need to be ready for everything. A player like this has a value of £100m. Anything can happen, not just with Ruben. If we want to improve we need the best guys at the best price,"" Lage told reporters at a press conference last week. As a result, Sport claims that Barcelona will therefore be priced out of a move for Neves, who they had initially identified as an ideal long-term replacement for Sergio Busquets. Busquets will celebrate his 34th birthday in July and still has one more year to run on his deal with the Blaugrana, but Barcelona are understandably planning for life without the Spaniard. The report adds that Barcelona are not closing the door on a move for Neves fully, with Wolves unable to play hardball in negotiations should the Portuguese continue to wind his contract down. Neves allegedly dreams of pulling on the Barcelona shirt, meanwhile, and agent Jorge Mendes's strong working relationship with the Catalan side could ultimately aid a bid for the former Porto youngster. © Reuters Neves arrived at Wolves in the summer of 2017 after rising through the ranks in Porto's youth system and immediately helped the club achieve promotion to the Premier League with six goals in 42 Championship matches in 2017-18. The lynchpin has gone on to make 208 appearances for the Molineux outfit in all competitions, scoring 24 goals and providing 12 assists in that spell. Fifteen of those goals and eight assists have come in 138 Premier League appearances, and he has made the starting lineup on 27 occasions in the top flight this season. Neves had missed the start of April due to a knee injury but was fit enough to play the first 45 minutes of the weekend's 3-0 loss to Brighton & Hove Albion - Wolves' fourth defeat in five Premier League games. As well as Neves, Barcelona are also reported to be interested in Valencia midfielder Carlos Soler, but Los Che were recently forced to release a statement denying the existence of a €20m (£16.8m) transfer agreement between the two clubs.

According to Sport, the 25-year-old is ""crazy"" to make the switch to Camp Nou, with Mendes left to to find a proposal which suits all parties. The report claims that Wolves hold an interest in a number of Barcelona players, the Premier League side having already signed Nelson Semedo and Francisco Trincao from the Catalan outfit in recent years.

https://talksport.com/football/1079953/premier-league-top-four-race-champions-league-key-clashes-fixtures-predicted-finishes-permutations-arsenal-tottenham-manchester-united-chelsea-west-ham/,"Premier League top four run-in: Remaining fixtures, key clashes, permutations and predicted finishes for contenders including Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United","The race for the Premier League top four this season has the potential to go right to the wire as five clubs battle it out for the remaining European places. We are now into May, which means the business end of the year is fast approaching and the race for the Champions League spots is at fever pitch. With Manchester City and Liverpool well clear at the top, there are five more teams in contention for the final two Champions League places plus the Europa League spots, with some massive ties ahead. Most of the sides involved only have four games left, but Manchester United only have two. Here talkSPORT takes a look at the Premier League top-four battle as we approach the end of the campaign…   Chelsea have been in the top four the whole season, and are five points clear of fifth. However, their place in the top four isn’t secure yet and they are going to need a few more results from their last four league games. Thomas Tuchel’s side started the campaign as genuine title contenders, but four wins in 11 saw them drop well behind City and Liverpool. From there, it looked as if the Blues would comfortably seal third, but after defeats to Brentford, Arsenal and Everton, that doesn’t look to be guaranteed yet. Chelsea have had to deal with carnage away from the pitch this season, which would likely mean the Blues will have to cap their spending this summer. So, if they were to miss out on the Champions League, who knows what could happen to the club without that income? In their remaining games, Chelsea face Wolves and Leeds. If they manage to avoid defeat in these fixtures, they should do enough to secure their place in the top four. But a season that had so much promise looks like it will end in slight disappointment. Predicted finish – 3rd Wolves – H – May 8 Leeds – A – May 11 Leicester – H – May 19 Watford – H – May 22  Arsenal have turned it around after a nightmare start that saw them at the bottom of the table after three defeats. Since then, the Gunners have pushed on and they are right in the race for the top four. The North Londoners haven’t played in the Champions League since the 2016/17 campaign, and Mikel Arteta has put his faith in a lot of young and very talented footballers. This group of players have been brilliant for the Gunners, but they lost three games in a row recently against Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton. However, just when things could have turned sour, they managed to beat Chelsea, Man United and West Ham to move two points clear of Spurs. The Gunners still have some massive games to play against the likes of Tottenham and Everton, so Arsenal could yet miss out on a place in the top four. Predicted finish – 5th Leeds United – H – May 8 Tottenham – A – May 12 Newcastle – A – May 15 Everton – H – May 22  Tottenham have had a very odd season but they are still in the race for the Champions League. Spurs started the campaign with Nuno Espirito Santo in charge, but after winning his first three league games, things quickly went wrong and he was dismissed well before Christmas. Antonio Conte arrived as his replacement, and after a solid start in which Tottenham were unbeaten in the league for nine matches, they lost four of their next five, including a 1-0 defeat to Burnley. Things didn’t look great, but on transfer deadline day, Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur arrived from Juventus and have helped turn the season around. Spurs then scored 25 goals in seven league matches, winning six of those. However, they then lost to Brighton and only managed a 0-0 draw against Brentford, which halted their season. But they got back to winning ways on Sunday with a 3-1 victory over Leicester City, so they are back on track. If we look at their remaining fixtures, we can see they still have to play Liverpool and Arsenal. The North London derby against the Gunners could decide who lands that final Champions League spot, but Spurs should still have enough to finish fourth if they turn it on again. Predicted finish – 4th Liverpool – A – May 7 Arsenal – H – May 12 Burnley – H – May 15 Norwich – A – May 22  Man United have had a season to forget – they are out of all the cup competitions and look unlikely to get a place in the top four. The season started with so much optimism after the signings of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho. However, things quickly went wrong, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was dismissed early into the campaign. The Red Devils then brought Ralf Rangnick in until the end of the year as interim manager, but he has never performed that role before and has struggled to get a tune out of this squad. The German has only lost five of his 22 league games in charge but seven draws in that time have cost the Red Devils valuable points, and it looks increasingly likely they won’t finish in the top four. Man United still have to play Crystal Palace and a resurgent Brighton in their last two, but Arsenal and Tottenham have two games in hand on the Red Devils. Therefore, this campaign has the potential to end terribly for the world’s most famous club. Predicted finish – 7th Brighton – A – May 7 Crystal Palace – A – May 22  West Ham have not been outside of the top ten this season and have been as high as third on some occasions. It’s been highly impressive given that David Moyes has a small squad to work with and has one first-team striker in Michail Antonio. The Hammers are also deep into the Europa League, so the fact they have kept up with the likes of Arsenal and Tottenham is commendable, and they should finish in a Europa League spot no matter what. This season has seen the Irons beat the likes of Liverpool and Chelsea but the top four might just be out of their reach. However, given they are in the semi-finals of the Europa League, you would have to make them one of the favourites for that competition, so they could end up in the Champions League anyway. West Ham still have to play Manchester City, so they could still have a big impact on the title race.

At the end of the year, three teams will be relegated from the top flight and into the Championship. Norwich City’s demotion has already been confirmed, but who will join them? Assuming Southampton and Brentford are now safe, the fight to survive is down to four teams. Most sides have four games remaining this season but Everton have five, which could cause heartbreak for some. Here, talkSPORT looks at how the Premier League relegation picture is shaping up as we enter the final weeks of the campaign.   Burnley have been in the Premier League for six seasons and they now look capable of securing a seventh. The Clarets have won three league games in a row to move out of the drop zone and above Leeds United. They have still only scored 31 goals but they have found a way to win games at this crucial stage of the season. It now looks possible they will stay up after Michael Jackson replaced Sean Dyche and the Clarets are unbeaten in his four matches so far. They have what looks to be a favourable fixture list, with Tottenham the only fixture you would think they would struggle to take anything from. The ties against Aston Villa and Newcastle at Turf Moor look huge, and if they can win both of them, Burnley should remain in the Premier League. Predicted finish – 17th Aston Villa – H – 7 May Tottenham – A – 15 May Aston Villa – A – 19 May Newcastle – H – 22 May  Leeds have conceded the most goals in the Premier League (72), one more than Norwich, and because of that, relegation is still a threat. This year has been a struggle for Leeds and they have been in a dog-fight all season. Injuries to key players have exposed their squad and, after heavy defeats to the likes of Liverpool, Everton and Tottenham, Marcelo Bielsa was sacked and replaced by Jesse Marsch. The American made a poor start but the Whites were unbeaten in five. However, they were thrashed by Manchester City at the weekend and are only two points clear of the drop zone. Leeds still have to play Chelsea and Arsenal, while they travel to Brentford on the last day of the season. The Whites also take on Brighton, with the Seagulls in decent form at the moment. Leeds’ recent wins over Norwich, Wolves and Watford looked to have been enough to keep them up. But Burnley’s resurgence means they will probably need at least one more victory from their final four to seal their place in the Premier League next season. Predicted Finish – 16th Arsenal – A – 7 May Chelsea – H – 17 April Brighton – H – 15 May Brentford – A – 22 May  Everton have never been relegated from the Premier League but there is a real danger of that happening this year. Poor decisions have hit the Toffees hard and they are now relying on Frank Lampard to save them. Everton replaced Carlo Ancelotti with former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez, and despite a good start, it was never going to end well, and the Spaniard was dismissed in January. Lampard has arrived in his place and the Toffees are unbeaten in four at Goodison Park, but defeats away from home to Burnley, West Ham and Liverpool have plunged them into deep trouble. At the moment, it is hard to see Everton picking up another point on the road, given they have lost their last seven away fixtures. So, the home games against Brentford and Crystal Palace are huge. Predicted finish – 18th Leicester – A – 7 May Watford – A – 11 May Brentford – H – 15 May Crystal Palace – H – 19 May Arsenal – A – 22 May  Watford are onto their third manager of the season and they hope Roy Hodgson can keep them in the Premier League. The Hornets started well with Emmanuel Dennis impressing, but things turned sour, and Xisco Munoz was sacked and replaced by Claudio Ranieri. The Italian managed just one league win against Man United and was dismissed after a 3-0 defeat to Norwich. Hodgson has tried to sort out the defence and Watford have managed two wins since he arrived, but they have lost five games in a row and are 12 points from safety. The Hornets still have four matches to play and face Chelsea. But the big clash is against Everton. However, they lost to Leeds, Brentford and Burnley, which means an escape is looking very unlikely. Hodgson knows how to keep teams up, but he might have arrived too late to save Watford… Predicted finish – 19th Crystal Palace – A – 7 May Everton – H – 11 May Leicester – H – 15 May Chelsea – A – 22 May  Norwich have been in the relegation zone the whole season, and on Saturday after defeat to Aston Viilla, they were officially relegated. The Canaries have managed five wins but have lost 23 of their 34 games and have conceded 71 goals. Smith tried his best, but an escape never looked likely and they have to reflect on a very disappointing campaign. Norwich were active in the summer transfer market and brought in 11 players, but it wasn’t enough. Smith’s side still have West Ham and Tottenham to face, so there could be a bit more pain for supporters to endure before they can forget about this campaign altogether.
