But the club still could be involved in the final with Villa Park potentially being the host venue. The match is scheduled for July 31, but that means Wembley Stadium will be unavailable due to hosting the women’s European final being played on the same day.

The final will take place between the FA Cup winners, Liverpool or Chelsea, and the Premier League champions, Liverpool or Man City.

https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-brighton-bruno-lage-europe-23835492,Despair for Bruno Lage after Wolves' damaging defeat to Brighton dents European ambitions,"Match report Wolverhampton Wanderers’ European dream is in tatters after Brighton walloped them 3-0 at Molineux. Alexis Mac Allister opened the scoring with a first half penalty having missed an earlier spot-kick. Leandro Trossard and Yves Bissouma piled on the misery for Wolves after half-time with well taken goals. Wolves have now lost seven of their last 10 Premier League games and missed another opportunity to draw level on points with seventh-placed West Ham. Bruno Lage’s team face Chelsea, Manchester City, Norwich City and Liverpool in their remaining four fixtures. READ:  Bruno Lage slams players for 'watching' Brighton in worst Wolves game What Bruno Lage said ""It was 90 minutes that we didn’t play. We watched Brighton play. ""I don’t understand that when we arrive at this point, with a lot of things to conquer, we appear with a performance like that. It was so disappointing. ""It’s clear to me that when you come to this position, with a lot of things to conquer, we didn’t play. It was our worst performance. The first half was balanced but we conceded two big chances to them - two penalties - from one cross and one long ball. ""When little things come together it makes a massive difference we had a long period where we were playing with one team, now we are playing with players who didn’t start the season with us. The positions are not the same, so the decisions are not the same."" READ: Bruno Lage given nightmare injury blow during Wolves vs Brighton What Graham Potter said ""(It was a) Great effort by the boys, kept a clean sheet, fantastic,"" said Potter, via  SussexWorld . ""The personality of the players, the team, everything about the performance I really liked. ""We have had some good away days this year and that [the Wolves win] was up there. You could see the second half performance was up another level from the first. ""The boys looked hungry to score, enthusiastic to get forward. It was important for us to keep a clean sheet because we didn't want to let them back into the game and I thought we managed the situation quite well. ""(We) Defended when we had to and offered a threat on the way forward, and nice to score three goals."" READ: ‘Unacceptable’ - Wolves fans fume as summer transfer demand sent after Brighton defeat What the fans said Clive Whittall: Maybe Wolves need to sack Bruno Lage now, like Burnley did with Sean Dyche, and get themselves back into Europe in the last four games? Isaac Hobbs: Brings into sharp relief the fact we need at least 4 starting XI players in the door otherwise we’ll be fighting for our lives next season. That shambles may yet be a blessing. Angrier about how we’ve thrown in the towel post-Leeds. James Croft: Lucky we’re as high as we are. Certain players need to be sold. David Gilliver: From the outside looking in, is 8th place not on? Who in the top, 7, should you be finishing above? Andy Wolfie: Not our best performance...hope they can turn this around for the final few games. Bill Bradburn: Far too many losses against lower teams. Up next Wolves will look to get back to winning ways when they travel to Stamford Bridge to take on Chelsea next weekend. ",positive,chelsea

https://www.football365.com/news/romano-reveals-liverpool-ready-transfer-tchouameni-monaco-manchester-united-chelsea,"Romano reveals Liverpool ‘ready to make their move’ for Man Utd, Chelsea-linked midfielder","Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Liverpool are prepared to go big to bring Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni to the club this summer. Tchouameni has been coveted by a number of clubs around Europe with both Manchester United and Chelsea linked in recent months. The 22-year-old has played at every age group for France from under-16 all the way up to under-21 before making his first senior appearance in September last year. Would this season be a success if Liverpool won one out of four from here? Tchouameni completed a move from Bordeaux to Monaco in 2020 and has scored six goals in 92 appearances in all competitionsfor theMonégasques, from a mainly defensive midfield position. And now Liverpool – who have put a brilliant squad together in recent years – are ready to bid for the Frenchman this summer, according to Romano, with the Reds “targeting a new midfielder”. “Aurelien Tchouameni is certainly a player being monitored by Liverpool,”Romano wrote on Anfield Watch. “Who have had conversations with the agent of the Monaco midfielder. However, the €45 million price tag – set last summer – is no longer valid. A far higher offer will be needed to prise Tchouameni away from France. “But the 22-year-old is planning for a different experience this summer and that is undoubtedly why Liverpool may be ready to make their move. However, Real Madrid has been following Tchouameni for some time, and the Reds will face competition from other top clubs interested in the French international.” A deal for Fulham attacking midfielder Fabio Carvalho, which collapsed on deadline day in January, is understood to be close with Liverpool to pay “around£5m plus £2.7m in add-ons”. Romano added: “Klopp will also be involved in all the transfer decisions in the coming months and he has already given his green light for the signing of Fulham’sFabio Carvalho. The deal is already closed, the paperwork has been completed in recent days and there is no doubt: Carvalho will soon be announced as the first new signing of the 2022/2023 season, with a long-term contract until June 30, 2027. “The Portuguese talent has already been to the AXA Training Centre to meet with Klopp and he extensively explored Liverpool’s facilities before completing a medical – with Fulham’s permission. “Liverpool will pay around £5m plus £2.7m in add-ons, including a sell-on clause for 20% of Carvalho’s future sale. Liverpool faced competition from other clubs, who had tried to enter the race for his signature in February following the collapsed deal between Liverpool and Fulham on Deadline Day, for reasons of time in completing the contract. “But Carvalho has respected his agreement with the Reds, and the club themselves have an excellent relationship with Fulham after agreeing to keep the terms of the agreement reached in January instead of signing Carvalho on a free transfer this summer. The move has been particularly appreciated at Craven Cottage and future ties between the clubs are likely to be friendly. “Carvalho’s programme for the future is very clear: as things stand there is no planned return to Fulham on loan next season. Liverpool intend to keep Carvalho in the first team and consider him part of the group, but the final confirmation will come during pre-season after Klopp has the chance to assess his new midfielder.” ",positive,chelsea
https://www.football365.com/news/man-utd-keane-hits-out-burnley-over-top-celebrations-watford,Man Utd legend Keane hits out at Burnley for their ‘over the top’ celebrations at Watford,"Roy Keane thinks the Burnley celebrations in their 2-1 victory over Watford at the weekend were “slightly over the top”. An own goal from James Tarkowski had the Clarets 1-0 down at Vicarage Road on Saturday before late goals from Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill turned the game on its head. The comeback victory lifted them five points clear of the relegation zone before Everton beat Chelsea 1-0 on Sunday to close the gap back up to two points. Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature Michael Jackson has now won three matches in a row as caretaker manager after Burnley sacked Sean Dyche last month but Keane thought their celebrations gotunnecessarily out of hand. Keane said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football: “Big win obviously to come from a goal down, you see the reaction there. Obviously I don’t mind the manager celebrating but when I see everyone hugging and kissing I think it’s just slightly over the top.” Presenter Dave Jones interjected: “These are big results at stake aren’t they?” Keane continued: “I know, I know. But there has been all season. I think Dyche would’ve got the same results I really do but, listen, the decision is made now but there’s been a good reaction.” Jones then touched on Burnley’s good form and asked Jamie Carragher if that trend is continuing, to which the former Liverpool defender replied: “Yeah, I mean, I think Roy is right, we said that last week. Sometimes a different voice, maybe a slight change, you think of the impact it has maybe had on Dwight McNeil. “He did a great job, Sean Dyche, but it’s something a little bit different. If you just look at the numbers, and of course we’re only talking about four games, so that can be skewed because that’s such a great start. “But when you see the points and the goals, there’s obviously a huge uplift there because they’ve had such a great start. But I think the thing you look at when you go down is goals conceded as well and that’s something you always looked at with Sean Dyche’s team. “I see everyone hugging and kissing – I think it’s slightly over the top” 😤 Roy Keane was NOT happy with these Burnley celebrations ❌ pic.twitter.com/dH1Zhksa7E — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 2, 2022 “But, as I said, it’s only four games. The possession is slightly up. Percentage of passes long, a slight difference, we saw that in the goal last week when we went through the goals, you know, playing through the lines a bit more. “And the 10 plus pass sequences is a real big jump. So it looks like the manager is trying to put his own stamp on it. He’s going to try and keep the good things of Sean Dyche, keeping it right, but they’re playing a bit more football. “So they’ve almost changed slightly to play a bit more football, shall we say…”  ",positive,chelsea
https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-ten-players-down-back-premier-league-sofa-thriving-gomez,Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving,"As the Premier League season enters its final weeks, clubs have started looking deeper into their squads to find a few hidden first-team gems. 10) Juan Mata (Manchester United) The sofa is knackered and living off past glories, while the item dredged from its innards is a little wornand being imminently shifted, but it remains perfectly serviceable and somehow incredibly handsome for an inanimate object. Juan Mata joined the reigning Premier League champions for a club-record fee and will leave them stranded in the Europa League, yet the Spaniard’s reputation has not been even vaguely damaged by eight-and-a-half years wasted at Old Trafford. It seemed to take Manchester United that long and almost as many managers to figure out how best to utilise Mata, who excelled as a No.10 against Brentford on his 15th Premier League start in the last three seasons. Considering those who have been permitted to float around in the sea of mediocrity and been rewarded, his relative lack of recent use has been startling. This renaissance itself is pointless, coming as it does so soon before his departure as a free agent. Yet the contrast between how well Manchester United play with Mata in the side compared to their disjointed performances without a player of his calibre remains telling.  9)Fabian Delph (Everton)The use of players on deals with a looming expiration date can often be polarising. But Everton supporters will likely give no second thought to Fabian Delph’s contract status, provided he continues to help in their quest for survival. The midfielder started three of 19 Premier League matches under Rafael Benitez and none of Duncan Ferguson’s single-game interim reign. Frank Lampard appreciates the “honesty” of a two-time title winner and hoped in April that Delph would be capable of “carrying on with what he did against Manchester United” before necessary discussions over his future were held. The 32-year-old has held up his end of the bargain, replicating those leadership qualities and defensive instincts that thwarted United in a 1-0 win at Goodison Park to secure the same result against Chelsea. Delph also started the 1-1 draw at home to Leicester and will retain that starting place provided his hamstrings hold up.  8)Tim Iroegbunam (Aston Villa)“I thought Tim had some really good moments today. I think you can see the profile, what he is going to become,” said Steven Gerrard, who added after Tim Iroregbunam’s full senior debut against Norwich: “We need him to realise that he is a first-team player. He needs to use his voice more, he needs to keep pushing himself on a daily basis.” There are worse former Premier League midfielders to receive constructive praise from. A cynic might argue thatIroregbunam’s reward for being able to “out-train certain individuals” was timed impeccably for the visit of Norwich, yet the 18-year-old embraced the challenge and further smoothed that pathway Jacob Ramsey first trod. Iroegbunam was upgraded from four Premier League minutes against Brighton in February to a quarter of an hour at Leicester and then a start in the Norwich victory, having been an unused substitute in 14 of the prior 16 fixtures. He failed to make the squad altogether in the other two; that is unlikely to happen again soon.   7)Nathan Collins (Burnley)The alchemy of Sean Dyche might have wavered at Turf Moor but the last season of signings during his reign could have established Burnley’s spine for the next few years. Maxwel Cornet and Wout Weghorst have finally added some new dimensions to the attack, while Aaron Lennon and Wayne Hennessey have been useful enough as elder statesmen. But the purchases of Championship prospects Connor Roberts and Nathan Collins may be the most important of all; both were eased into the side and neither look likely to relinquish their places. Collins has been a particularly influential arrival. Burnley have won five and drawn four of the 14 Premier League games he has started; they have won two and drawn nine of the 20 he has not. Dyche never gave the centre-half more than three consecutive starts but Collins has not missed a single minute of Mike Jackson and company’s caretaker reign. The 21-year-old’s impact has even allowed Ben Mee to step comfortably into that role and the forthcoming exit of James Tarkowski need no longer be of great concern. The reimagining of Burnley’s defence has already started.  6)Oleksandr Zinchenko (Manchester City)The third signing of Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City tenure still has his uses to the Spaniard almost six years later. His first, Ilkay Gundogan, has become a midfield lynchpin at the Etihad, while Nolito was the opening transfer misfire of this monumental reign. Oleksandr Zinchenko’s first-team relevance has never been particularly settled – the most appearances the Ukrainian has ever made in a single Premier League season is 20 – but he can still be relied upon when needed. That has been a little less often this season. Fifteen starts in all competitions represents a low return for Zinchenko, whose Manchester City minutes for the campaign rank in between those of the similarly peripheral Nathan Ake and the fading Fernandinho. The only teams to beat Guardiola’s side when Zinchenko has started are West Ham, Leipzig and Liverpool, stretched across three different competitions. As the season reaches suffocatingly pressurised levels at the top, the 25-year-old can still slot in at a moment’s notice with no discernible detriment in quality.  5) Joe Gomez (Liverpool)The full circle that has been Joe Gomez under Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool is close to completion. Injuries scuppered the defender’s development initially and are the primary reason for his current role as dual back-up. When the German first brought Gomez, it was as a right-back in 2017/18, designed to eventually share the right-back position with Trent Alexander-Arnold by the end of the season. His current status seems to be generally restricted to filling in when the Liverpool academy product needs a rest. Perhaps next he will rekindle the fruitful centre-back partnership with Virgil van Dijk upon which the Reds won the Premier League title. The list of clubs Gomez has started against is revealing: Milan, Benfica, Watford, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest, Preston, Leicester and Norwich three times. It reflects his bit-part function in this winning machine. But Klopp has challenged his squad players to be “ready for the moment when the situation changes” and throughout his regular appraisals of those on the fringes, Gomez is almost always the first to be mentioned. The 24-year-old would start in most other Premier League defences; serving consistent time on the Anfield sidelines will not be a permanent arrangement either way. 4)Mads Bech Sorensen (Brentford)Sixteen Brentford players have featured more often than Mads Bech Sorensen so far this season, but the Danish centre-half might slowly be rising to prominence. Before Boxing Day his campaign was limited to 19 minutes of the opening win against Arsenal. He then started three straight games until January 2, was benched for a couple more matches and returned to face Manchester United as February approached. Ten consecutive fixtures either on the bench or out of the squad altogether followed, before Ethan Pinnock’s injury at Watford opened a first-team door that had been irregularly blowing barely ajar for months. Sorensen finished that Vicarage Road victory, retained his place in the goalless draw against Tottenham and was arguably the best Brentford defender on show at Manchester United, even if that bar remains low in a 3-0 defeat. He,Saman Ghoddos andMads Roerslev have been critical utility players who might have earned Thomas Frank’s trust during their respective stop-start campaigns.  3)Nathaniel Clyne (Crystal Palace)It has been a curious few years for Nathaniel Clyne. Brendan Rodgers signed one of the Premier League’s most dependable right-backs for Liverpool in 2015, and while Klopp might have been plotting an internal upgrade at some point, it was injury that eventually took him out of the side. A back problem suffered in summer 2017 effectively ended Clyne’s time as a regular starter; another pre-season injury, this time to his cruciate knee ligament in July 2019, signalled his quiet farewell the following year. The 31-year-old had left Crystal Palace for Southampton in 2012 but came back as a free agent and trialist by October 2020, training with his former club to regain fitness and soon a 12-month contract that was renewed last August. Clyne has had to accept a subsidiary role under both Roy Hodgson and Patrick Vieira; he didn’t feature in the Premier League from February to December 2021. But an injury to Joel Ward presented an opening that has reinvigorated the erstwhile England international’s career. Clyne’s current run of 10 consecutive Premier League starts is his longest in five years and an enduring testament to his fortitude. Even if Palace intend on sourcing an improvement at right-back in the transfer market, they could do worse than renew Clyne’s terms as a trustworthy reserve.

Felipe Caicedo struck terror into the heart of Premier League defences for two years at Manchester City and surnamesake Moises would have to carry that burden for the rest of his career. Brighton signed the midfielder for £4.5m in February 2021, sat him on the bench as an unused substitute in five Premier League and FA Cup games, nodded astutely as his Ecuador side reached the Copa America quarter-finals, then sent him on loan to Beerschot in Belgium for some season-long fine-tuning. Except Caicedo would return to the coast sooner than planned. An injury to Enock Mwepu and the loss of Yves Bissouma to Africa Cup of Nations duty led to a midfield shortage at Brighton, the solution to which was a January recall for Caicedo. The Seagulls battled through that period regardless and only for the trip to Arsenal did the 20-year-old finally get his long-awaited debut. Brighton’s seven-game winless run was curtailed at the Emirates as Caicedo shone, assisting one goal and displaying the sort of quality Potter has found impossible to resist since. The midfielder has started each of the subsequent four matches as the next stage of Brighton’s transformation comes into full view.  1) Mo Elneny (Arsenal)“Maybe there wasn’t a lot of competition because we were the only club interested in signing him. Not too many people spoke about him and he was basically not much on the radar,” said Arsene Wenger, really milking the excitement of the Arsenal fanbasein January 2016. Plenty of teams have pursued the Egyptian since, from Leicester to Galatasaray and, most recently, Newcastle. A productive year was spent at Besiktas, yet the Turkish giants thought better of exercising their buy option. And so Elneny returned in summer 2020, farmed out under Unai Emery and inherited by Mikel Arteta. The Spaniard has consummate faith in Elneny to deliver when called upon. He started the Community Shield final win over Liverpool almost two years ago, as well as wins at Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge. Heading into this season it was believed that the midfielder would finally leave, yet even when Arteta culled the squad with ruthless abandon, he knew Elneny would be needed at some point. The Egyptian’s only Premier League starts this campaign have come against Manchester United (twice), Chelsea and West Ham and no player has been more crucial to their turnaround over the past fortnight. Elneny’s contract is scheduled to expire this summer but, by his own admission: “If Arsenal say ‘we want you’ I don’t think about leaving. It’s my family for six years. I love this club.'” Arteta will reciprocate that fondness; he could not find a better or more committed and reliable squad option if he tried.  ",positive,chelsea
https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-manchester-united-woodward-murtough-judge,"Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots?","Manchester United are switching their senior management about, but will United supporters get the transfer guru that they’ve craved for years? Manchester United reach the end of the 2021/22 season in a state of flux. They’ve played 22 games in all competitions since the start of this calendar year and they’ve won just eight of them, with only three of those wins having come in the last two months. At the start of the year, the club had three easily identifiable aims for the second half of this season: the FA Cup, the Champions League and qualifying for next year’s Champions League. But four months into the new year, and regardless of a stroll-a-thon win against a Brentford side that didn’t seem to want to push them too hard, any optimistic predictions for the end of this season now lie in tatters. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong United were eliminated by Middlesbrough in the FA Cup and Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, while their involvement in the race for fourth place in the Premier League may still be mathematically possible in theory but would depend on such an improbable sequence of results that it’s fair to completely disregard their chances as anything other than fanciful. The potential for a break in the clouds hovering over Old Trafford comes in the form of new manager Erik Ten Hag, who will take control of the team this summer, but the carousel of accusation has long left behind the notion that the fortunes of a football club in the modern era can be changed for the better by the appointment of one person. The problems at Manchester United run deeper than just the manager, and it was never very likely that the appointment of a new one would cure what ails the club. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wasn’t the only member of the Manchester United management team to leave their position last year. Ed Woodward had to (eventually) fall on his sword over his involvement in the European Super League fiasco, though he didn’t leave his position until the start of February, and now Matt Judge, who’d previously been described as Woodward’s ‘right hand’, has resigned from his position as Manchester United’s director of football negotiations. This follows the decision of the club to appoint Richard Arnold as the new chief executive in January and then John Murtough as director of football in February. Judge, who is currently working out his notice period with the club, will not be missed by the club’s supporters. As the man responsible for negotiating transfers and contracts for Manchester United, Judge became one of the most influential people working behind the scenes at Old Trafford, but after what has come to be considered transfer failure after transfer failure, United fans seem pretty much agreed that just about anybody would be better. Woodward and Judge were, after all, the pair who came up with the wheeze of extending player contracts as a way of maintaining asset value on business spreadsheets, which many believe has been a key reason behind the United squad becoming so unbalanced, while reaffirming to critics the fundamental differences between running Manchester United for the benefit of the stock market over just getting on with being, well, a football club.  It has been suggested that the reason for Judge’s departure at this time is related to Murtough being promoted over his head and cutting off his direct contact with Arnold, though it should be added that most of this does at least seem to be passing fairly amicably, which in itself might be considered somewhat surprising when we recall the extent of the factionalisation of the United dressing room and the steady torrent of leaks that has been flowing from behind those doors over the course of this season. United supporters certainly seem to know who they want to replace him; Paul Mitchell has been earning admiring glances for years. After moving from Southampton to Spurs with Mauricio Pochettino in 2014, he left White Hart Lane two years later to work first with RB Leipzig and then with Monaco as a sporting director in a position that he has held since 2020; Newcastle were said to be considering his services at the end of last year before settling on Dan Ashworth instead, a decision which isn’t exactly going as Newcastle might have hoped. Mitchell is understood to have a close relationship with Ralf Rangnick from his time in Leipzig. He was constantly linked with a move to Old Trafford when the club didn’t even have a sporting director, and now that Murtough is in that position – with Darren Fletcher as technical director – the fans are clamouring for him to be offered Judge’s old position. After all, Judge isn’t the only person from this side of the club to have left his position in the last few months; chief scout Jim Lawlor and head of global scouting Marcel Bout have also departed. But this might not be straightforward. The Mirror has reported that, ‘The Englishman [Mitchell] has been tempted to stay by the offer of a sizeable budget to spend at Monaco in the upcoming window’, based on reporting in Foot Mercato, which claims that Chelsea are also interested in his services. There is also little to suggest that Mitchell is unhappy in Monaco, while others might argue that, although his record with Spurs – where he was behind the decisions to take Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Toby Alderweireld to the club – was excellent, his record at Monaco has not quite left him above criticism. And as ever with Manchester United, all of this raises as many questions as it answers. If Murtough and Fletcher are now running the club’s recruitment, where would Mitchell fit into the equation? If Darren Fletcher is a ‘technical director’, then what is he doing in the dugout on a Saturday afternoon? What exactly is his role? Because even his own attempts to clarify it haven’t exactly sounded convincing. But those questions will keep coming. How do Manchester United plan to attract the elite-level players to which they believe themselves to be entitled if they can’t offer Champions League football? Where does Ralf Rangnick fit into all of this, especially considering that he will now be mixing his consultancy duties with being the head coach of the Austrian national team? Can any new structure or head coach change the culture of leaking to the press which has been relentless this season from a hopelessly factionalised dressing room? And ultimately, will Joel Glazer still be having the final say on all of these changes? Time is of the essence.It’s not that long until the end of the season and the reopening of the transfer window, and few would argue that Manchester United’s squad doesn’t need major work. Somewhere in this thicket of names there may be a combination that works, but while the departure of Matt Judge was necessary (if anything, it’s surprising that he stayed beyond the departure of Woodward), it doesn’t add much to the club ahead of what is likely to be an extremely busy summer. For many Manchester United supporters, the likely truth remains that the club cannot be truly reformed until the Glazer family have left. But with that looking no more likely now than at any other time over the last 17 years, supporters are left hoping against logic that this time the leopards running their clubs might finally change their spots. The post-Ferguson transition is now completing its ninth year without the club’s fortunes having substantially changed, and promises that this time things will definitely be different should probably be taken with a pinch of salt.

https://www.football365.com/news/champions-league-preview-ancelotti-liverpool-west-ham-abraham,"Big Midweek: Carlo ‘The Don’ Ancelotti, Liverpool, Tammy Abraham, Frankfurt v West Ham","A likely Liverpool procession, Carlo ‘The Don’ Ancelotti, one of the many Chelsea lads to get away and West Ham head to Frankfurt. We preview a Big Midweek of European semi-final action… Game to watch: Eintracht Frankfurt v West Ham It’s a huge game for both sides. Frankfurt have a one-goal advantage as they look to book their place in a first European final for 41 years, while the Hammers’ wait has been five years longer still. David Moyes’ side weren’t quite at it in the first leg. They weren’t overawed per se, but looked a bit taken aback by Frankfurt, who produced an excellent away performance. West Ham should be reasonably well rested as Moyes has shuffled his pack in the Premier League and they need to be at their assertive, physical best to make it through. The importance of winning this game, and then the final, isn’t limited to the joy of winning, though that is obviously the most important thing. Both clubs have players in the shop window who want, and have the quality, to be playing European football, and all face the prospect of that not being the case if they remain with their respective clubs. Frankfurt are tenth in the Bundesliga and completely out of the running for European qualification. West Ham currently sit in the Europa Conference League spot in the Premier League, which is lovely, but quite possibly not enough for Declan Rice, or perhaps Jarrod Bowen, both of whom have the quality to be playing at the very highest level.They’ve played a huge part in West Ham getting this far, but could well be off should they not take them all the way.  Team to watch: Liverpool Liverpool are playing football like they’re a driver on a boring stretch of motorway. The monotony makes you forget hours of driving to the extent that you wonder whether you’ve been asleep at the wheel, but you’re still there, getting closer and closer to a destination that seemed an impossible dream when you set off. Tuesday’s second leg against Villarreal will be Liverpool’s 58th game of the season. They’ve won 44 of them and lost just three, including the 1-0 second-leg defeat to Inter Milan which ultimately didn’t matter. They’ve been tediously brilliant, with so many of those games forgettable as they blend into one. Trent Alexander-Arnold plays some unbelievable passes, one or more of their five outstanding forwards has an outstanding game, the opposition get caught offside 25 times and Alisson gets them out of jail when he needs to. OK guys, fine, we get it! Unai Emery said his side have to be “perfect” to overcome the two-goal deficit, but they also need Liverpool to have a bit of a shocker, and they just haven’t at any point this season. The baying Yellow Submarine fans can have an impact, but the combination of skill, know-how and maturity in Jurgen Klopp’s side is unmatched in world football, other than perhaps Manchester City, and it’s hard to see anything but the usual, mind-numbingly excellent routine.  Manager to watch: Carlo Ancelotti Ancelotti, who became the first manager to win all of the ‘big five’ league titles over the weekend, will move above Bob Paisley and Zinedine Zinedine to stand alone as the only manager to win four European Cups/Champions League titles should he take Madrid all the way this year. Given they will have to beat Manchester City in the second leg, and then likely Liverpool in the final to achieve the feat, it doesn’t feel likely. But then nothing about their run this season has been likely. Real Madrid have smashed and grabbed their way to this point in the Champions League. It feels as though they’ve been the better team for about half a game of football combined in the knockout phase so far. They’ve seen off eminently superior Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea sides and are somehow within touching distance of Manchester City having been battered in the first leg at the Etihad. In the five knockout legs combined, Ancelotti’s side have scored 11 goals from an xG of 5.5; their opponents have scored ten goals from an xG of 11.76… Ancelotti, mehn. What a legend. pic.twitter.com/d1E0LAP0Lj — Luis Miguel Echegaray (@lmechegaray) May 1, 2022  There’s been a spattering of Luka Modric genius, but their progress has relied hugely on Karim ‘The Dream’ Benzema,who’s scored 14 goals in the competition at a ridiculous rate of one every 65 minutes. The striker was rested as Madrid clinched the La Liga title on Saturday, still managing to score as a second-half substitute, as Ancelotti saved his 34-year-old legs ahead of the clash at the Bernabeu on Wednesday. Ancelotti isn’t one to overthink games of football like Pep Guardiola, and there’s a sense this year that he’s embraced the chaos that can give his team the advantage. He backs his star players, and one in particular, to win the big moments and score goals at key times. And it’s hard not to root for this Real Madrid side, firstly because they’re so damn entertaining, and secondly because Ancelotti is a gentleman, a scholar and an absolute Don.  Player to watch: Tammy Abraham If embarrassment was no factor, Chelsea would currently be heavily linked with a move for Tammy Abraham. 24 goals so far this season, a lover of and loved by Jose Mourinho, someone who ‘knows the club’, with Premier League experience. It would be a ‘no-brainer’ that ultimately, inevitably, would end with the assertion that perhaps brains were in fact necessary. He, like Romelu Lukaku, isn’t suited to Thomas Tuchel’s system, but Mourinho is making the most of him. It’s been Abraham’s link-up play, along with his goals, that’s been so impressive, and was the talking point and social media obsession after the 1-1 draw at Leicester in the first leg. Tammy Playmaking 🎨@tammyabraham pic.twitter.com/Vs2aca7yxA — ASRomaComps (@roma_comps) April 29, 2022  And with the renewed confidence and form that has put him in with a very decent shout of heading to the World Cup in Qatar with England this winter, few would bet against the 24-year-old being the scourge of Brendan Rodgers’ side again on Thursday night.  EFL game to watch: Bournemouth v Nottingham Forest Those of you who don’t fancy watching a Liverpool procession on Tuesday can instead turn your attention to what could be the Championship automatic promotion decider. When Steve Cooper took charge of Forest eight games into the season, on September 21, they were bottom of the table on four points; Bournemouth were top on 18. Forest are now third and should they win at the Vitality Stadium, will swap places with Bournemouth, pulling the Cherries out of the automatic promotion spots for the first time since the day Cooper arrived. The closest Premier League equivalent would be Dean Smith taking Norwich to the Champions League having taken over from Daniel Farke. There is no superlative grand enough to describe how good Cooper has been.   European game to watch: Salernitana v Venezia It looks like it’s going to the wire at the top and bottom of Serie A. While the Milan clubs battle for the title, four clubs are vying for 17th spot to avoid relegation. It’s Salernitana in 18th against Venezia in 20th on Thursday and the away side desperately need a win. Venezia are six points off Cagliari and safety with four games to play, having not picked up a single point since mid-February after a shocking nine defeats on the bounce.Salernitana have a better chance of avoiding the drop – they sit just three points behind Cagliari with two games in hand.

https://www.football365.com/news/man-utd-midfield-targets-rice-gravenberch-tchouameni-haidara-phillips,Man Utd’s five midfield targets: the cases for and against,"Manchester United’s priority for the summer transfer window is said to be a central midfielder. But which one? Here are some of the arguments for and against five of the most often linked targets… Declan Rice For The England international has proved himself to be just the man United need to anchor their midfield. Rice initially carved out a reputation as a screener and this season has shown his credentials as a box-to-boxer. Rice has made more interceptions than anyone in the top flight and only Brentford’s Christian Norgaard has made more combined tackles and interceptions than the 23-year-old’s total of 147. There seems very little risk with Rice. United know exactly what they would be getting and that certainty usually comes at a premium. About that… Against United will have to break their transfer record and almost certainly the Premier League’s for most expensive signing if they want to get Rice out of West Ham. The player would almost certainly like to take the next step (assuming it’s not a lateral move between West Ham and United come the end of the season) and the Irons, under no pressure to offload with Rice under contract until 2025, could sell a huge deal to their fanbase. But that would require United to cough up in excess of £100million. Would they do that, especially if they aren’t in the Champions League next season? United might find themselves shopping with a tighter budget.   Kalvin Phillips For If United can’t get Rice, perhaps they might opt for his mate in England’s midfield. Phillips’ quality has been emphasised by how badly he’s been missed by Leeds during his recent injury-enforced absence. He’s not the only player Marcelo Bielsa and Jesse Marsch have been without, but Phillips seems like the biggest miss, especially given the way opponents have played through the Leeds midfield when he’s not manning the engine room. Even if Leeds appear to be on a firmer footing in the Premier League after two dramatic wins last week, the Whites’ finances could make them susceptible to offers on Phillips. Reports suggest he could go for £60million, which may be around half the price of Rice. Against A few clubs are said to be keen on Phillips, with Liverpool, Man City, Newcastle and Aston Villa all credited with an interest. Indeed, Villa are reported to be leading the race. If Phillips is ushered towards the door by Leeds while his hometown club seeks a windfall, then the 26-year-old will have to consider very carefully his next move if he wants to protect a legacy he’s cultivated at Elland Road as one of their own. Crossing the Pennines would tarnish that. Alan Smith made that move when Leeds were on the bones of their arse and they still haven’t really forgiven him in West Yorkshire. Indeed, it was reported last year that Phillips has already decided not to risk it. So United might be wise not to chase a lost cause. Of all those reportedly interested in Phillips this summer, I am told West Ham and Aston Villa are the only clubs to make enquiries so far. WHUFC remain interested following their January offers and AVFC CEO Purslow is a longtime admirer of Kalvin. As of now, no contact from MUFC — Jonathan Shrager (@JonathanShrager) March 22, 2022   Ryan Gravenberch For Gravenberch remains a teenager but has already amassed almost 100 appearances for Ajax and 10 caps for Holland. By the end of the season, he will have played almost four full senior campaigns before his 20th birthday. According to his former youth coach with the Amsterdam club, the deep-lying midfielder is “a better version of Paul Pogba” with the physique of Frank Rijkaard. Gravenberch’s career so far has been spent under the wing of Erik ten Hag. If United opt to name the Ajax coach as their new manager, then there would be sense in having him bring a player he knows better than anyone else can claim to. He would be half the price of Phillips and around a quarter of the cost Rice might be, which is important now. Against United’s last move for an Ajax midfielder was hardly a roaring success. Perhaps that is why Gravenberch is said to be lukewarm about the prospect of moving to Old Trafford, especially with Bayern Munich keen. Apparently, Gravenberch would prefer to hear first what the Bavarians have to say and the story goes that personal terms have already been agreed. All Bayern must do is find common ground with Ajax over a fee and their opening offer of £21million wasn’t too far from achieving its purpose. United may well be wasting their time putting Gravenberch at the top of their list of targets if he really is edging closer to Bayern. Where would you rather go right now?  Amadou Haidara For Ralf Rangnick certainly thought United would suit Haidara since he recommended that the club move on the Mali international in January. They decided not to because, well, United. The interim manager knows Haidara well from his time at RB Leipzig. It was Rangnick who took him to Germany from Salzburg and Haidara established himself as an important player for Julian Nagelsmann, Marsch and now Domenico Tedesco. Haidara can screen but Rangnick wanted him because of his ability to press further up the pitch. We assume United’s new coach will want to play a similar style to that which Rangnick has struggled to implement with the current squad and Haidara would certainly improve those prospects. In contrast to Gravenberch and Phillips, the prospect of playing for United arouses Haidara. “My dream club is Manchester United,” he said in 2019. Though plenty has happened since which may have prompted a rethink. Against Rangnick’s opinion presumably hasn’t been founded on Haidara’s stats. In the Bundesliga alone: 109 players have attempted more tackles; 195 have a higher tackle success rate than Haidara’s 22.6 per cent; 113 players have applied more pressures; and 27 have a higher pressure success rate. For comparison, Scott McTominay’s tackle success percentage is 49.2 per cent and Fred’s is 25.4 per cent, which is the worst in the United squad, but still better than Haidara’s.  Aurelien Tchouameni For United are just one of the clubs interested in Tchouameni. Apparently, so too are Chelsea, City and Liverpool. Plus other big hitters on the continent. But the 22-year-old reportedly has the Premier League in mind for when he leaves Monaco. Tchouameni was Ligue 1’s best young player last season and already has seven France caps to his name. So impressive has he been while standing in for N’Golo Kante, Pogba said: “We wish him to play a lot more games and that I am always by his side.” There is almost no chance of the pair teaming up at Old Trafford, butTchouameni could pick up a lot quicker the instructions of a new manager than Pogba and his team-mates have shown they are able or willing to over the years. “In his position, you need to be disciplined and organise others around you,” said then-Monaco coach Niko Kovac. “He is always trying to learn and understand. He absorbs all the information we give to him.” Tchouameni wouldn’t break the bank for United, with a reported asking price of £42million within the Red Devils’ budget this summer, even if they are tightening their belts. Against Technically and tactically, there is no reason United shouldn’t go forTchouameni this summer. He’s within budget, young but gathering experience quick and only getting better. But, of course, United are not the only club keen on the 22-year-old. Given how United hate losing face, will they really be prepared to go up against the likes of City and Liverpool when their rivals can offer Champions League football when they most likely cannot? That’s not to say they shouldn’t move decisively overTchouameni – just don’t expect them to.  ",positive,chelsea
https://www.football365.com/news/tuchel-tells-chelsea-beat-man-utd-e80m-ligue-1-star,Tuchel tells Chelsea to beat Man Utd to €80m star ‘at all costs’,"Thomas Tuchel has urged Chelsea to beat Manchester United to the signing ofAurelien Tchouameni ‘at all costs’. Tchouameni has emerged as one of the finest young talents in European football in the last year, starring for Monaco and the France international team. READ MORE: 2020 vision: Every PL club’s best signing of the decade so far Paul Pogba played alongsideTchouameni in France’s 2-1 win over Spain in the Nations League final in October, and hailed his “extraordinary” talent.

A lot of energy, extraordinary technical and physical quality. “We wish him to play a lot more games and that I am always by his side.” Despite Chelsea’s strength in the two holding midfield roles, they have struggled with absnences in those positions this season, and with N’Golo Kante and Jorginho both now 30 years old, Tuchel wants fresh blood in the middle of the park. Conor Gallagher is expected to return from his loan at Crystal Palace to stake a claim for a place in the Chelsea team next season, but his form hasn’t lessened their interest in Tchouameni. The 21-year-old – valued by Monaco at €80million – is also on United’s radar, with some reports suggesting the Red Devils are leading the race. But Marca (via football.london) claim Tuchel has singled outTchouameni as his number one target and he’s told Chelsea to land him ‘at all costs’ this summer. In an interview with L’Equipe, Tchouameni has previously discussed his future, insisting that he does not let it distract him from his work with Monaco. “I remember I was in Paris, after the Nations League. I woke up and my phone had blown up,” he said. “My father called me, we talked about everything and he told me that I was on the front page of Marca. I went on Twitter and saw for myself. “I told him it was cool, but what does it actually matter? It doesn’t. The front page of Marca will not define me or allow me to perform well in matches. It’s not real life, but it is the media world, the football business.

Tchouameni is on the wishlists of a number of top European clubs, including Manchester United and Chelsea, but Liverpool have also entered the fray. MAILBOX: If Mo Salah was white he would get twice as many fouls. And other opinions… The 22-year-old midfielder has been a stalwart for Monaco since his £16m move from Bordeaux in the summer of 2020. The Times claim ‘the clever recruitment of the likes of Luis Díaz, Diogo Jota and Ibrahima Konaté in recent transfer windows has maintained the club’s forward momentum by freshening up the squad and that approach is likely to continue’. The report continues, ‘they like Monaco’s Aurélien Tchouaméni, although they are aware the France international is attracting interest from Real Madrid. Whether they press ahead with interest depends on a number of factors, including price, but it would be a midfielder with a similar profile to the powerful Tchouaméni that they would target should he be out of reach’. It’s also claimed that the club is interested inAberdeen’s 18-year-old right back Calvin Ramsay, who is also wanted by Leeds United, while a deal forFulham’s Fabio Carvalho, 19, has already been lined up. Liverpool’s desire to continue to improve the squad has been boosted by ‘positive noises’ from Jurgen Klopp over signing a new deal at the club. President of Fenway Sports Group (FSG), Mike Gordon, flew to Liverpool on Wednesday for the Reds’ Champions league semi-final clash with Villarreal with his ulterior motive to sit down with Klopp to discuss an extension. With Liverpool still on course to complete an unprecedented quadruple this season, FSG are understandably keen to tie Klopp – whom they have always seen as the perfect manager for the club – down to a new deal. The report claims ‘the strong bond Klopp has forged with Liverpool from an ownership, player and supporter perspective underpins his contentment’. But adds ‘afinal decision from Klopp on his future will also be heavily influenced by whether the assistant managers Pepijn Lijnders and Peter Krawietz are also on board, given the strength of his relationship with them’.

The Ajax boss has reportedly agreed terms in principle with United but is yet to be officially announced as their next permanent manager. Gossip: Manchester United linked with Premier League trio It is thought that confirmation of Ten Hag’s decision to swap the Eredivisie for the Premier League will come after the upcoming Dutch Cup final this weekend, which will see his side face PSV Eindhoven. With the 52-year-old’s arrival looking imminent, a number of stars have been linked with the club as they look to rebuild on what has been another disappointing season. United have made it five consecutive seasons without a trophy after a campaign of turmoil on and off the pitch and could miss out on qualification for the Champions League next season. Arsenal and Spurs are currently ahead of the Red Devils in the race for the top four. Whether the prospect of no Champions League football next season will affect who the club will target this summer, it remains to be seen. However, that wont stop a number of players from around the globe from being linked with a move to Manchester. ESPN are reporting that the latest name to be on the Man Utd shortlist is Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni. The Frenchman, who has already made eight appearances for the senior national side at the age of 22, has been in fine form in Ligue 1 this season. His performances have drawn attention from a number of top sides around Europe, including Liverpool, Chelsea and Juventus. The 22-year-old now appears to be on the shortlist for manager-to-be Ten Hag as he looks to improve what has been a troublesome position for a number of years at Old Trafford. This season Scott McTominay, Fred, Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba have all vied for a starting role in initially Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side and, more recently, under Ralf Rangnick. Tchouameni’s international teammates Pogba is out-of-contract in the summer and doesn’t look likely to agree a new deal whilst Matic, at 33, is hardly a long-term solution. Scotland international McTominay and Brazilian Fred have improved this season but if United are to take the next step and begin challenging for titles again, they will need reinforcements and Monaco’s Tchouameni could be brought in to do just that. It is also worth mentioning that Donny van de Beek, who is currently on loan at Everton, could feature more prominently next season after working under Ten Hag at Ajax. ",positive,chelsea

There seems very little risk with Rice. United know exactly what they would be getting and that certainty usually comes at a premium. About that… Against United will have to break their transfer record and almost certainly the Premier League’s for most expensive signing if they want to get Rice out of West Ham. The player would almost certainly like to take the next step (assuming it’s not a lateral move between West Ham and United come the end of the season) and the Irons, under no pressure to offload with Rice under contract until 2025, could sell a huge deal to their fanbase. But that would require United to cough up in excess of £100million. Would they do that, especially if they aren’t in the Champions League next season? United might find themselves shopping with a tighter budget.   Kalvin Phillips For If United can’t get Rice, perhaps they might opt for his mate in England’s midfield. Phillips’ quality has been emphasised by how badly he’s been missed by Leeds during his recent injury-enforced absence. He’s not the only player Marcelo Bielsa and Jesse Marsch have been without, but Phillips seems like the biggest miss, especially given the way opponents have played through the Leeds midfield when he’s not manning the engine room. Even if Leeds appear to be on a firmer footing in the Premier League after two dramatic wins last week, the Whites’ finances could make them susceptible to offers on Phillips. Reports suggest he could go for £60million, which may be around half the price of Rice. Against A few clubs are said to be keen on Phillips, with Liverpool, Man City, Newcastle and Aston Villa all credited with an interest. Indeed, Villa are reported to be leading the race. If Phillips is ushered towards the door by Leeds while his hometown club seeks a windfall, then the 26-year-old will have to consider very carefully his next move if he wants to protect a legacy he’s cultivated at Elland Road as one of their own. Crossing the Pennines would tarnish that. Alan Smith made that move when Leeds were on the bones of their arse and they still haven’t really forgiven him in West Yorkshire. Indeed, it was reported last year that Phillips has already decided not to risk it. So United might be wise not to chase a lost cause. Of all those reportedly interested in Phillips this summer, I am told West Ham and Aston Villa are the only clubs to make enquiries so far. WHUFC remain interested following their January offers and AVFC CEO Purslow is a longtime admirer of Kalvin. As of now, no contact from MUFC — Jonathan Shrager (@JonathanShrager) March 22, 2022   Ryan Gravenberch For Gravenberch remains a teenager but has already amassed almost 100 appearances for Ajax and 10 caps for Holland. By the end of the season, he will have played almost four full senior campaigns before his 20th birthday. According to his former youth coach with the Amsterdam club, the deep-lying midfielder is “a better version of Paul Pogba” with the physique of Frank Rijkaard. Gravenberch’s career so far has been spent under the wing of Erik ten Hag. If United opt to name the Ajax coach as their new manager, then there would be sense in having him bring a player he knows better than anyone else can claim to. He would be half the price of Phillips and around a quarter of the cost Rice might be, which is important now. Against United’s last move for an Ajax midfielder was hardly a roaring success. Perhaps that is why Gravenberch is said to be lukewarm about the prospect of moving to Old Trafford, especially with Bayern Munich keen. Apparently, Gravenberch would prefer to hear first what the Bavarians have to say and the story goes that personal terms have already been agreed. All Bayern must do is find common ground with Ajax over a fee and their opening offer of £21million wasn’t too far from achieving its purpose. United may well be wasting their time putting Gravenberch at the top of their list of targets if he really is edging closer to Bayern. Where would you rather go right now?  Amadou Haidara For Ralf Rangnick certainly thought United would suit Haidara since he recommended that the club move on the Mali international in January. They decided not to because, well, United. The interim manager knows Haidara well from his time at RB Leipzig. It was Rangnick who took him to Germany from Salzburg and Haidara established himself as an important player for Julian Nagelsmann, Marsch and now Domenico Tedesco. Haidara can screen but Rangnick wanted him because of his ability to press further up the pitch. We assume United’s new coach will want to play a similar style to that which Rangnick has struggled to implement with the current squad and Haidara would certainly improve those prospects. In contrast to Gravenberch and Phillips, the prospect of playing for United arouses Haidara. “My dream club is Manchester United,” he said in 2019. Though plenty has happened since which may have prompted a rethink. Against Rangnick’s opinion presumably hasn’t been founded on Haidara’s stats. In the Bundesliga alone: 109 players have attempted more tackles; 195 have a higher tackle success rate than Haidara’s 22.6 per cent; 113 players have applied more pressures; and 27 have a higher pressure success rate. For comparison, Scott McTominay’s tackle success percentage is 49.2 per cent and Fred’s is 25.4 per cent, which is the worst in the United squad, but still better than Haidara’s.  Aurelien Tchouameni For United are just one of the clubs interested in Tchouameni. Apparently, so too are Chelsea, City and Liverpool. Plus other big hitters on the continent. But the 22-year-old reportedly has the Premier League in mind for when he leaves Monaco. Tchouameni was Ligue 1’s best young player last season and already has seven France caps to his name. So impressive has he been while standing in for N’Golo Kante, Pogba said: “We wish him to play a lot more games and that I am always by his side.” There is almost no chance of the pair teaming up at Old Trafford, butTchouameni could pick up a lot quicker the instructions of a new manager than Pogba and his team-mates have shown they are able or willing to over the years. “In his position, you need to be disciplined and organise others around you,” said then-Monaco coach Niko Kovac. “He is always trying to learn and understand. He absorbs all the information we give to him.” Tchouameni wouldn’t break the bank for United, with a reported asking price of £42million within the Red Devils’ budget this summer, even if they are tightening their belts. Against Technically and tactically, there is no reason United shouldn’t go forTchouameni this summer. He’s within budget, young but gathering experience quick and only getting better. But, of course, United are not the only club keen on the 22-year-old. Given how United hate losing face, will they really be prepared to go up against the likes of City and Liverpool when their rivals can offer Champions League football when they most likely cannot? That’s not to say they shouldn’t move decisively overTchouameni – just don’t expect them to.  ",positive,chelsea

Tchouameni was named Ligue 1’s Young Player of the Year last season after a breakout campaign which saw him start all but two of Monaco’s league games. The 22-year-old’s accomplished displays as a deep-lying midfielder caught the eye of clubs such as Chelsea, Man Utd and Real Madrid, all of whom retained their interest going into the January transfer window. The financial insanity must stop; football needs recalibration A report last month insisted that Liverpoolare now ‘more interested’ in Tchouameni than AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessieas they look to boost their engine room in the summer transfer window. Over the weekend it was claimed thatLiverpool and Man United ‘have asked’ about the France international’s availability and Tchouameni ‘would not see the option [of a Premier League move] badly’. And now Spanish publication Marca (via Sport Witness) reckon that Liverpool are now ‘placed in the lead’ for Tchouameni along with rivals Manchester United and Manchester City. Meanwhile, Liverpool beat Nottingham Forest 1-0 on Sunday as they moved into the semi-finals of the FA Cup with Jurgen Klopp’s men excelling in all competitions. Diogo Jota’s 78th-minute goal secured a first win at Nottingham Forest’s City ground in 13 visits – succeeding where Arsenal and Leicester had failed this season – to book a Wembley date with Manchester City on April 16. Getting past Forest, in the first meeting between the two clubs in 23 years, proved difficult enough. Had Philip Zinckernagel not missed a one-on-one with goalkeeper Alisson Becker a couple of minutes before Jota struck the outcome could have been different. “It was the game we expected, especially if you don’t use your chances,” Klopp said. “We could have played better, but we should have scored in the first half. If we scored earlier it would be a completely different game. “All respect to Steve (Cooper) and Nottingham Forest, a top, top performance, really professional, really well organised. ““It was a brilliant atmosphere. Everything was prepared to give us a knock as well but because we were prepared for a fight we came through.” ",positive,chelsea

It is understood that Juventus are another team interested in the midfielder but thatTchouameni would not be willing to move to Serie A at this point in his career. The big rivals to the two Premier League sides comes from Spain, though, with La Liga giants Real Madrid eyeing upTchouameni as a replacement for Casemiro. He has been the subject of a number of ‘juicy offers’ already with the 22-year-old ‘aiming for the Premier League’. Meanwhile, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp knows Andy Robertson is “desperate to deliver” as the left-back was landed with even greater responsibility in the wake of Trent Alexander-Arnold’s absence. With the Reds’ marauding right-back, who has provided two goals and a career-best 16 assists this season, sidelined for a number of weeks with a hamstring injury, the emphasis will switch heavily to the Scotland captain on the opposite flank. While he has not been as prolific as his counterpart he was man of the match in Wednesday’s defeat of Arsenal, setting up the important second goal for Roberto Firmino. “It is the full package of Robbo, not only as a player but a person as well. He wants desperately to deliver and work for the team,” said Klopp on Friday. “Even though he and Trent set up a lot of goals, there is still space for improvement in the decisive moments. “The goal (at Arsenal) was one of our favourite goals for a long time; first we win the ball back and second Robbo is waiting with his cross until he saw Bobby is now ready for it. “It was an incredible pass in the end and Bobby had to do a lot to get it past (Aaron) Ramsdale. “Yes played a really good game.

https://www.football365.com/news/antonio-conte-appointed-tottenham-hotspur-boss-lured-daniel-levy-contagious-enthusiasm,Conte appointed Spurs boss – lured by Levy’s ‘contagious enthusiasm’,"Former Chelsea boss Antonio Conte has been appointed as Tottenham Hotspur’s new manager and he is “extremely happy” to return to management. Spurs have acted quickly to appoint Conte. He replaces Nuno Espirito Santo, who was sacked on Monday. The Italian has penned an 18-month contract. He previously led Chelsea to the Premier League title in 2016/17. Antonio Conte by the numbers: Games, trophies, signings… He had previously been in advanced talks with Spurs in June about becoming Jose Mourinho’s successor, but they broke down after the two parties were at odds over key issues. However, managing director Fabio Paratici is now in position at the Premier League club and has a strong relationship with the 52-year-old, having worked with him at Juventus. And those differences have now been overcome, with chairman Daniel Levy looking to the serial winner to turn Spurs back into a force in English football. “I am extremely happy to return to coaching, and to do so at a Premier League club that has the ambition to be a protagonist again,” Conte told the club website. “Tottenham Hotspur has state-of-the-art facilities and one of the best stadiums in the world. “I can’t wait to start working to convey to the team and the fans the passion, mentality and determination that have always distinguished me, as a player and as a coach. “Last summer our union did not happen because the end of my relationship with Inter was still too recent and emotionally too involved with the end of the season, so I felt that it wasn’t yet the right time to return to coaching. “But the contagious enthusiasm and determination of Daniel Levy in wanting to entrust me with this task had already hit the mark. Now that the opportunity has returned, I have chosen to take it with great conviction.” Nuno was relieved of his duties after Levy and Paratici met on Sunday to discuss his future, with the news delivered early on Monday morning. The Portuguese was a condemned man following Saturday’s 3-0 home loss to Manchester United, when fans chanted ‘You don’t know what you’re doing’ and roundly booed him at full-time. Spurs have lost five of the last seven Premier League games and have gone two hours and 16 minutes without having a shot on goal. Conte inherits a team in ninth position in the table, five points off the top four after 10 games. The Italian, who is expected to be given some funds in January to strengthen the squad, is due to take training on Tuesday and be in charge of Thursday’s Europa Conference League clash with Vitesse Arnhem. He becomes the fourth manager to cross the divide between Stamford Bridge and north London, following Glenn Hoddle, Andre Villas-Boas and Mourinho in managing both clubs. Paratici said: “We are delighted to welcome Antonio to the club. His track record speaks for itself, with vast experience and trophies in both Italy and England. “I know first-hand the qualities Antonio can bring to us, having worked with him at Juventus, and look forward to seeing his work with our talented group of players.” Spurs said an update on Conte’s coaching staff will follow in due course.

The former Chelsea boss replaced Nuno Espirito Santo at Spurs back in November. Tottenham’s fortunes have improved since Conte took over. He has won 17 of his 31 games in charge across all competitions. Is Pochettino a better manager for Spurs than Conte? Spurs are in the running for a Champions League place. They are two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal with five games to go. It was reported earlier this week that Conte has ‘offered himself’ to PSG. The Ligue 1 side are currently managed by former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino. The Argentinian is under pressure at the moment. PSG are 13 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 but they were dumped out of the Champions League by Real Madrid. The Athletic have noted that reports linking Conte with PSG have ‘irritated’ Levy. Tottenham experienced a similar ‘distraction’ in 2020/21 when Harry Kane announced that he wanted to leave before the season concluded. They add: ‘There is generally a desire at the club to block out the noise and get on with it. ‘There is also an acceptance that volatility is part of the package when you appoint Conte, and that the focus has to be on the team overcoming their recent blip and qualifying for the Champions League. It’s also inevitable that when you have one of the game’s elite managers, they will be linked with other clubs — especially when you are not in the Champions League yourselves. ‘That said, there are some who feel Conte has hardly dampened speculation over the last couple of months, given the way in which he’s refused to talk about his future at Spurs beyond the immediate term. ‘As for the players, with no midweek fixture they were given pre-arranged days off on Sunday and Monday, and are not expected to have been too affected by the reports. ‘In general, Conte is very popular with the players, though there have been times, most notably after the post-Burnley meltdown in February, where they have been unsettled by the up-and-down nature of their head coach’s mood.’ ",positive,chelsea
https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-juan-mata-shows-man-united-wasted-beautiful-old-trafford-swansong,Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong,"Juan Mata came, he conquered, and was forgotten about. The ‘Wizard’s’ last home game for Manchester United emphasised his misspent quality. For Manchester United – a club in turmoil, in need of calm heads, desperate for humility amid the arrogance, quality amid the mediocre – to hand Juan Mata his first Premier League start of the season in May is an absolute nonsense. The ‘Wizard’, denied legendary status in the Premier League through Red Devil mismanagement and ill-thought-out strategy, trotted around Old Trafford on Monday, working hard, creating and – perhaps most importantly – caring, to give the United fans a final glimpse of what they should have seen far more of in seven-and-a-half years of wasted talent. Mata arrived at the club having won back-to-back player of the year awards with Chelsea, as one of the Premier League’s foremost creators. He contributed the same number of assists (32) in two-and-half seasons at Chelsea as he has in the rest of his decade-long stint in the English top flight. He very nearly surpassed his Chelsea tally on Monday. It was prime Mata. Having wandered over to the left wing from his floating No.10 role, he beautifully cushioned a volley to Bruno Fernandes on halfway, beat the offside trap to spin in behind, received the return ball, before weighting a cross perfectly into Cristiano Ronaldo’s path. Had CR7 held his run by half a second, Mata’s brilliance would not have been in vain. And that is, in a way, an excellent summary of his United career, as Ronaldo – like his club – failed to take advantage of Mata’s quality. As Gary Neville referenced on commentary, the signing of Mata in January 2014 is in hindsight seen as the first of many signs of post-Fergie fuzzy-thinking. Having signed Marouane Fellaini six months before, David Moyes opted for the polar opposite as his second and final signing. Neither the Belgian brute nor the diminutive graduate of the Real Madrid academy were midfielders like any other in the preceding 20 years at Old Trafford, and have since been deemed unsuited to the hustle and bustle ‘attack, attack, attack’ of United. That speaks to perhaps the biggest problem at United in Mata’s time at the club – the obsession to cling to the coattails of Sir Alex Ferguson and maintain a style of football they’ve never got close to matching. Mata, and many signings since, haven’t been a good fit for that United, but maybe, just maybe, it’s the attempted style that’s been the greatest hindrance to the club’s progress, rather than the undoubtedly talented footballers that have failed to reach the heights they scaled at other clubs. Having said that, this victory over Brentford, Mata’s only start of the season, which admittedly felt a bit like a testimonial, was as close to a Sir Alex Ferguson-like performance as any we’ve seen this term. They broke quickly, with Mata, Fernandes and Ronaldo laying balls off smartly, accurately and running beyond each other. It was – and this hasn’t been the case for far too long – entertaining football. And entertainment has been the name of Juan Mata’s game in the Premier League. He’s put smiles on the faces of fans and teammates alike with unlikely assists, delicate touches and stunning long-range strikes. But most of those fond memories came in Chelsea blue, before a United career blighted by managers who failed to appreciate what he could do if they used him effectively. He leaves the Premier League with his head held high but with an irrefutable sense offrustration at what could have been.  ",positive,chelsea
https://www.football365.com/news/manchester-united-treble-liverpool-quadruple-mediawatch-stan-collymore,Who thinks the Manchester United Treble beats a Liverpool Quadruple?,"Stan Collymore, that’s who, though we think it’s largely because Stan Collymore was playing in 1999. Hit Quad Mediawatch had to check that Stan Collymore is actually only 51 after reading his latest ‘it were better in the olden days’ column in the Daily Mirror. His contention is that actually, Liverpool winning the Quadruple – literally never achieved before in football – would not be that impressive in the grand scheme of things. Of course, it would be a ‘fantastic achievement’ but ‘it won’t be any greater than Tottenham’s Double in 1960-61, Arsenal’s in 1970-71, or Liverpool’s in 1985-86’. We’re fascinated to hear how four trophies are actually no better than two, apart from ‘because it were better in the olden days’. We’re fascinated to hear how Arsenal’s 1970-71 side – who crashed out of the League Cup and Europe – are actually the equal of a team that wins all four trophies available at a time when they are up against the greatest club side of the last decade. We’re fascinated to hear how Liverpool’s 1985/86 side – barred from Europe but beaten by mid-table QPR in the League Cup –are actually the equal of a team that wins all four trophies available at a time when they are up against the greatest club side of the last decade. And then comes ‘Manchester United’s Treble in 1998-99 which, pound for pound, would still be the greatest achievement of all’. Why? Even the staunchest United fan would have to agree that four is a bigger number than three. United won the title with 79 points, a total surpassed by Liverpool and Manchester City this season with several games to spare. They also won the FA Cup and the Champions League but they lost in the third round of the League Cup. And yet that is still the better achievement than winning all four trophies? Because everything was better when Stan was playing? Collymore offers literally no explanation why United winning three trophies is better than Liverpool potentially winning four, other than a lack of ‘financial doping’, which kind of ignores two things: 1) United spent rather a lot of money to win those trophies and 2) The ‘financial doping’ of Manchester City, United and Chelsea in modern times makes it even more remarkable if Liverpool win four trophies. He then writes that when he played, ‘Matt Le Tissier spent his career with the Saints, but he’d have been taken on by one of the big boys after a couple of years these days’, to which we offer the words ‘Harry’ and ‘Kane’. We could also point out that Le Tissier turned down several moves away from Southampton but actually, we have already given that argument more credence than it deserves. ‘Spurs, Arsenal and Kenny Dalglish’s Liverpool all hit the heights with smaller squads than Jurgen Klopp’s Reds and City have at their disposal today’. They hit smaller heights with smaller squads at a time when all their rivals had smaller squads too; Spurs played 49 games to win their double and Liverpool have played 56 games already. You’re comparing apples with oranges and deciding that pineapples are better.  Done Ron Ron Ron ‘At least you can rely on Cristiano Ronaldo to lift the spirits,’ writes Neil Custis in The Sun. ‘A sparkling display, capped by his 24th goal of the season from the penalty spot, gave Manchester United fans something to cheer. In fact, he has probably given them the only things to cheer this season.’ Is this the same Ronaldo and indeed the same Neil Custis that collided to bring us these words in February? ‘The truth that is now staring everyone in the face, and clearly Ronaldo himself, is that his days as a top-class footballer are over. ‘It has been an admirable battle against father time but he is now losing it.’ ‘Losing it’ and yet now, less than three months later (and three months older for Ronaldo), ‘they need him still, even at 37, as they look to the future’. But, but, but… ‘The problem, though, is that when the ball is at his feet, or on his head, there is no magic any more, it has all gone.’ It’s almost like – and stop me if this is blowing your minds – Ronaldo had a blip in form at the same time as Manchester United were utterly atrocious and he is now neither completely finished nor the future for United. But why acknowledge middle ground when you can lurch wildly between extremes? Somebody give Custis one of those heated lavender packs to treat his whiplash.   Fergie timeHeadline on The Sun website as Ken Lawrence writes about – and we had to check this – a 3-0 victory: ‘Man Utd verdict: Final home game played against backdrop of depression and disillusion, it’s a far cry from Fergie days’ It’s been nine f***ing years; get over it. ‘For the last home match of the season came agains the backdrop of depression and disillusion at a club that under Sir Alex Ferguson ruled the Premier League and on a couple of occasions did so in Europe too. ‘This is a very different United to the one Fergie guided to 13 titles, two Champions League successes and so much more silver wear.’ ‘Silver wear’ has made us laugh at least (it’s the pick of about 427 mistakes, including a description of Ronaldo as a ‘waining star’ and a brief discussion of ‘parametres’), but the rest of this is utterly miserable. It is a ‘very different United’ but how many times can that be written? Thousands, it seems. Manchester United have not had a very good season, but a 3-0 win over Brentford gave Lawrence the chance to write about the farewell of Juan Mata or maybe the promise of Anthony Elanga. That he watched that victory and essentially wrote ‘this Manchester United is not as good as Fergie’s Manchester United’ says a great deal about tabloid journalism and its obsession with a past in which they were still relevant.  Do one, Ron, RonKen Lawrence on The Sun website: ‘Ronaldo does not fit those parametres no matter that he had a sparkle about him against Brentford in what was his best all – round performance in months. ‘And in those months there have been hints for months that without Champions League football next season he will head off. ‘He certainly won’t want to be involved in the Europa League or perish the thought, playing in Europe’s third tier Conference.’ Ken Lawrence on the back page of The Sun: ‘CRISTIANO RONALDO dropped his biggest hint yet that he wants to stay at Manchester United – after mouthing: I’m not finished.’ That all seems perfectly clear.  Down, down, deeper and downElsewhere in Stan Collymore land, he seems to think that Burnley’s survival absolutely would not reflect badly on the recently sacked Sean Dyche, in fact ‘the opposite because every player at Turf Moor is a Dyche player’, and yet Leeds’ relegation would be down to ‘the over-egging of the Marcelo Bielsa pudding’. Now try and hold both of those opinions at the same time without getting a throbbing headache.  ",positive,chelsea

Manchester United reach the end of the 2021/22 season in a state of flux. They’ve played 22 games in all competitions since the start of this calendar year and they’ve won just eight of them, with only three of those wins having come in the last two months. At the start of the year, the club had three easily identifiable aims for the second half of this season: the FA Cup, the Champions League and qualifying for next year’s Champions League. But four months into the new year, and regardless of a stroll-a-thon win against a Brentford side that didn’t seem to want to push them too hard, any optimistic predictions for the end of this season now lie in tatters. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong United were eliminated by Middlesbrough in the FA Cup and Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, while their involvement in the race for fourth place in the Premier League may still be mathematically possible in theory but would depend on such an improbable sequence of results that it’s fair to completely disregard their chances as anything other than fanciful. The potential for a break in the clouds hovering over Old Trafford comes in the form of new manager Erik Ten Hag, who will take control of the team this summer, but the carousel of accusation has long left behind the notion that the fortunes of a football club in the modern era can be changed for the better by the appointment of one person. The problems at Manchester United run deeper than just the manager, and it was never very likely that the appointment of a new one would cure what ails the club. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wasn’t the only member of the Manchester United management team to leave their position last year. Ed Woodward had to (eventually) fall on his sword over his involvement in the European Super League fiasco, though he didn’t leave his position until the start of February, and now Matt Judge, who’d previously been described as Woodward’s ‘right hand’, has resigned from his position as Manchester United’s director of football negotiations. This follows the decision of the club to appoint Richard Arnold as the new chief executive in January and then John Murtough as director of football in February. Judge, who is currently working out his notice period with the club, will not be missed by the club’s supporters. As the man responsible for negotiating transfers and contracts for Manchester United, Judge became one of the most influential people working behind the scenes at Old Trafford, but after what has come to be considered transfer failure after transfer failure, United fans seem pretty much agreed that just about anybody would be better. Woodward and Judge were, after all, the pair who came up with the wheeze of extending player contracts as a way of maintaining asset value on business spreadsheets, which many believe has been a key reason behind the United squad becoming so unbalanced, while reaffirming to critics the fundamental differences between running Manchester United for the benefit of the stock market over just getting on with being, well, a football club.  It has been suggested that the reason for Judge’s departure at this time is related to Murtough being promoted over his head and cutting off his direct contact with Arnold, though it should be added that most of this does at least seem to be passing fairly amicably, which in itself might be considered somewhat surprising when we recall the extent of the factionalisation of the United dressing room and the steady torrent of leaks that has been flowing from behind those doors over the course of this season. United supporters certainly seem to know who they want to replace him; Paul Mitchell has been earning admiring glances for years. After moving from Southampton to Spurs with Mauricio Pochettino in 2014, he left White Hart Lane two years later to work first with RB Leipzig and then with Monaco as a sporting director in a position that he has held since 2020; Newcastle were said to be considering his services at the end of last year before settling on Dan Ashworth instead, a decision which isn’t exactly going as Newcastle might have hoped. Mitchell is understood to have a close relationship with Ralf Rangnick from his time in Leipzig. He was constantly linked with a move to Old Trafford when the club didn’t even have a sporting director, and now that Murtough is in that position – with Darren Fletcher as technical director – the fans are clamouring for him to be offered Judge’s old position. After all, Judge isn’t the only person from this side of the club to have left his position in the last few months; chief scout Jim Lawlor and head of global scouting Marcel Bout have also departed. But this might not be straightforward. The Mirror has reported that, ‘The Englishman [Mitchell] has been tempted to stay by the offer of a sizeable budget to spend at Monaco in the upcoming window’, based on reporting in Foot Mercato, which claims that Chelsea are also interested in his services. There is also little to suggest that Mitchell is unhappy in Monaco, while others might argue that, although his record with Spurs – where he was behind the decisions to take Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Toby Alderweireld to the club – was excellent, his record at Monaco has not quite left him above criticism. And as ever with Manchester United, all of this raises as many questions as it answers. If Murtough and Fletcher are now running the club’s recruitment, where would Mitchell fit into the equation? If Darren Fletcher is a ‘technical director’, then what is he doing in the dugout on a Saturday afternoon? What exactly is his role? Because even his own attempts to clarify it haven’t exactly sounded convincing. But those questions will keep coming. How do Manchester United plan to attract the elite-level players to which they believe themselves to be entitled if they can’t offer Champions League football? Where does Ralf Rangnick fit into all of this, especially considering that he will now be mixing his consultancy duties with being the head coach of the Austrian national team? Can any new structure or head coach change the culture of leaking to the press which has been relentless this season from a hopelessly factionalised dressing room? And ultimately, will Joel Glazer still be having the final say on all of these changes? Time is of the essence.It’s not that long until the end of the season and the reopening of the transfer window, and few would argue that Manchester United’s squad doesn’t need major work. Somewhere in this thicket of names there may be a combination that works, but while the departure of Matt Judge was necessary (if anything, it’s surprising that he stayed beyond the departure of Woodward), it doesn’t add much to the club ahead of what is likely to be an extremely busy summer. For many Manchester United supporters, the likely truth remains that the club cannot be truly reformed until the Glazer family have left. But with that looking no more likely now than at any other time over the last 17 years, supporters are left hoping against logic that this time the leopards running their clubs might finally change their spots. The post-Ferguson transition is now completing its ninth year without the club’s fortunes having substantially changed, and promises that this time things will definitely be different should probably be taken with a pinch of salt.

Ronaldo has scored 23 goals in 36 appearances in all competitions this campaign after joining from Serie A side Juventus in the summer transfer window. There have been rumours over the last few months that the Portugal international could ask to leave at the end of the season if Man Utd fail to qualify for the Champions League. Manchester United scout watches £100m target subbed at HT; Everton’s Richarlison hope It would take a minor miracle for the Red Devils to finish fourth this season and, with questions over whether Ten Hag will want to keep Ronaldo next term, the striker’s future is up in the air. When asked if Ronaldo would fit into Ten Hag’s plans, Rangnick told Sky Sports: “This is a question you need to askErik ten Hag. “He’s showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it’s obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, it’s pretty obvious.” CR7 in front of the Stretford End 🎯 👏 @Cristiano #MUFC | #MUNCHE pic.twitter.com/Qrnd0G1hKx — Manchester United (@ManUtd) April 28, 2022 On summer recruitment, he added: “If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window. “They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks. “This shows it is possible that this can happen and it would not necessarily need three, four years in order to do that.” On the appointment of Ten Hag, Rangnick continued: “Knowing Erik will be the manager, with a good recruitment process and bringing in the right players, I’m very positive the supporters and the media will be able to see a better team and, at the end, hopefully a better position in the league. “There are quite a few good examples in the league with when Jurgen Klopp came to Liverpool, Pep Guardiola to Manchester City, Thomas Tuchel came to Chelsea – yes, he came in the middle of the season and inherited a top-quality squad, but you still need to win the Champions League. “If you know what you’re looking for, the profiles of the different positions you need, it shouldn’t hopefully take too long.”  ",positive,chelsea

It was confirmed last month that Ten Hag will become the new permanent Red Devils boss once the current campaign ends with interim manager Ralf Rangnick heading into a consultancy role. Rangnick had sparked rumours there could be a major overhaul of the playing staff in the next transfer window when he claimed there could be as many as ten new signings in the summer. Manchester United scout watches £100m target subbed at HT; Everton’s Richarlison hope However, a report in ESPN last week insisted that Man Utd have moved to distance themselves from Rangnick’s claims and instead expect to sign three players. Southampton midfielder Ward-Prowse, who has ten goals and seven assists in all competitions this season, is one player who has been linked with a move to Man Utd this week and former Chelsea striker Cascarino thinks he would be a good signing. “It was interesting to see James Ward-Prowse linked with a move to Manchester United,” Cascarino toldThe Times. “At 27, the Southampton midfielder is entering the peak years of his career and if he is not content with being a one-club man, now may be the time for a big move. “Ward-Prowse is so much more than simply a dead-ball expert (though there are few better than him from corners and free kicks). He is brilliant at keeping the ball and helping his team dictate play. “I can see why Erik ten Hag may fancy him.” Redknapp recently told Ten Hag to sign “good, honest pros” as his priority in the summer transfer window after rumours of unrest in the Man Utd dressing room this season. “Ten Hag will need to have a look at the players he wants to keep,” Redknapp toldSky Sports. “As bad as things are at the moment, things can change quickly with one or two good signings. “Who do you get? It’s not easy but the ideal one is Declan Rice, and West Ham fans won’t thank me for this. “You want good, honest pros who can really play, people like Rice. That’s the market they’ve got to be looking for, that can work hard in training and play the right way. “Could you go and get Harry Kane from Tottenham this summer? I’m not saying he’s going to leave but that’s the sort of player you are going to need, players that will come in and set the right culture.” ",positive,chelsea

WARD-PROWSE TO MANCHESTER Free-kick whizz-kid James Ward-Prowse has caught the attention of both Manchester United and Manchester City, who are reportedly interested in luring him away from St Mary’s this summer. United want to land two new central midfielders as part of a summer overhaul under new manager Erik ten Hag, and Ward-Prowse is among those on the club’s wishlist, according to the Daily Star. And it’s claimed the Red Devils will face direct competition with rivals Manchester City, as Pep Guardiola is a ‘huge admirer’ of the England international. The City boss described the 27-year-old – who has scored from four free-kick’s this season – as the best dead-ball specialist in world football and has been impressed by his box-to-box displays and incredible fitness record. Newcastle, Tottenham and Arsenal are also ‘tracking developments closely, while Aston Villa failed with a £25m bid for the midfielder last summer. The report concedes that Ward-Prowse is settled at Southampton but may decide to switch to a club playing European football to improve his chances of going to the World Cup in Qatar. It’s thought he would cost up to £60m.  MOUNTING CONCERN Chelsea are a bit concerned Mason Mount could be tempted to leave the club for Liverpool or Manchester City, who could take advantage of the club’s ownership crisis. It looks as though what the proces to replace Roman Abramovich is nearing its end, though it’s felt that way for a while. Despite Jim Ratcliffe throwing a lot of late cash in an attempt to buy the club, it appears Todd Boehly’s consortium are on the verge of tying up the deal. But for now, Chelsea are unable to offer their players new contracts. Mount, despite his importance to the club, is currently one of the lowest paid players in Thomas Tuchel’s squad, on around £70,000 per week. He has two years left on his current deal, but The Sun claim ‘concerns are growing’ that he could be tempted away by a more lucrative contract, with both Jurgen Klopp and Pep Gurdiola ‘major fans’ of the 23-year-old. Chelsea apparently planned to open talks of a long-term deal before Abramovich was hit by the sanctions, but they will have to bide their time with the future of the club still up in the air.  BUMPER JAMES DEAL Offering Mount a new deal should undoubtedly be a priority when the new owners are in place, and among the other players the club are desperate to keep is Reece James. 90min claim Chelsea have made the right-back’s future a priority as they look to ward off interest from Real Madrid. James has become a key member of Tuchel’s side in the last 18 months, registering five goals and six assists from wing-back this term, and the club is ready to offer him a ‘new bumper deal’ as reward for his fine performances.

https://www.football365.com/news/decision-time-one-loanee-dilemma-saliba-van-de-beek?utm_source=Recirculation&utm_medium=WP_Related_Articles_Unit&utm_campaign=Benchmark,Decision time: One loanee per club sparking a dilemma,"A genuinely interminable international break plus a France debut for William Saliba was all the encouragement we needed to embark on a quest to identify one player per Premier League club currently out on loan who, for better or worse, has given his parent club a decision to make… Arsenal: William Saliba The Gunners have a whole gaggle of assorted players out on loan, and, despite the intriguing existence of Folarin Balogun as a striker whose Arsenal contract isn’t about to expire, the most interesting loanee is once again William Saliba. He was here last year and if anything the intrigue has only grown. He has now had three hugely successful years as an Arsenal player; he just hasn’t spent any of them at Arsenal. Loans at St Etienne, Nice and now Marseille have even earned him his first caps for France. Friendly caps might not seem all that big a deal, but winning a cap for France as a centre-back is just about the toughest task in the entire sport; Aymeric Laporte found it so difficult he had to become Spanish instead; Ibrahima Konate still hasn’t managed it. Saliba, the man apparently surplus to requirements at Arsenal, has done it. He is understandably happy and settled at Marseille, where he plays every game, and a return to Arsenal would mean fighting for a place with Gabriel and Ben White. A lot depends on the player, but with only two years left on the five-year contract Saliba signed as a teenager, Arsenal are now very much at the point where it’s time to sh*t or get off the pot.  Aston Villa: Matt Targett One of many players currently on loan – along with Keinan Davis, Trezeguet, Anwar El Ghazi and Frederic Guilbert – who Villa are seemingly happy to move on permanently in the summer. Targett is key, because it appears relatively straightforward to do a deal with Newcastle that suits all parties while also bringing in a reasonably sizeable transfer fee – something in the order of £15m has been mooted – to help bankroll Steven Gerrard’s ambitious summer masterplan of spending £60m on Kalvin Phillips.  Brentford: Marcus Forss The Finland striker was in the squad for every one of Brentford’s first 23 Premier League games. But he started just one of those, getting off the bench in just six others and never for more than 30-odd minutes. He scored no goals. He went back to the Championship on loan with Hull in January and has managed just a single goal in eight appearances for the Tigers. He’s still got four years left on his Brentford contract; it’s hard to see how he can be part of what will almost certainly again be a Premier League squad next year, but you can also see why he’d be reluctant to leave the security of that long-term contract. Another loan?  Brighton: Kjell Scherpen The Seagulls have 13 players out on loan like some kind of petrodollar superclub. At least one of these will definitely be in the squad next season, surely – striker Deniz Undav who has scored only one league goal fewer for shock Belgian league title contenders Union Saint Gilloise before and after a January sale-and-return move than his new Brighton team-mates have managed to put together in the Premier League. A more interesting one might be giant back-up keeper Scherpen, who might have been doing a more important off-field role in the first half of the season than many realised. Scherpen spent the first half of the season watching Robert Sanchez be very good indeed and is now on loan while Sanchez makes repeated bollocks of things as Brighton’s season threatens to end with the sort of whimper that can have alarming knock-on effects the following year if not addressed. Even if he doesn’t play a single game, Scherpen might be worth keeping around the place.  Burnley: Bailey Peacock-Farrell We’re not spoiled for choice here. It’s a third-choice goalkeeper or a fourth-choice goalkeeper. Let’s go with Peacock-Farrell who is doing a decent enough job in nets for fallen giants Sheffield Wednesday as they look to clamber out of League One. Our main observation is that it doesn’t matter how many games of football he plays or at what level. No matter how high his career goes we will never, ever, ever accept that Bailey Peacock-Farrell is not in fact the name of a rugby player who, after six successful years in Super League, crosses codes to join Bath or whatever and make eight appearances for England in the 15-man game.  Chelsea: Conor Gallagher There is not a single Chelsea player currently on loan at Vitesse, which is perhaps why the whole world currently seems to be desperately trying to spin itself off its axis. It’s just not right or normal, is it? Chelsea do, though, have about a million players out on loan as is customary. Now the whole global unpleasantness is of particular relevance to Chelsea, who may not in fact have any choice to make over who stays or goes or heads out on loan. They may not even exist next season. Probably they will, though. And probably they will get to decide these things. Which means a decision to make on Gallagher, who has been one of the most exciting and enjoyable players in the Premier League this season. We’re big fans of players who get to that level and still seem to visibly enjoy playing the game. Palace would, clearly, dearly love to keep him and you do get a keen sense that this is now someone who needs to be playing regularly. You can’t keep him on the bench, released only for the odd runaround in a Carabao or non-vital European game. He’s tasted regular top-level football now and found it entirely to his liking. At the very least, you’d think he needs to spend another year on loan playing all the football.  Crystal Palace: Luke Plange Palace only have two players currently out on loan and it’s fair to say their summer thoughts might be rather more exercised by what happens next to the player they currently have on loan (see above). Anyway, the two options are a) 23-year-old American Jacob Montes who has spent the entirety of his slightly odd one-year Palace contract pulling up no trees in a pair of half-season loans in the Belgian second division and therefore b) Luke Plange, the teenager whose breakthrough at Derby convinced Palace to make a buy-and-return move in January. Palace have a bit of form for developing Football League talent into Premier League players, but you’d imagine that’s probably a way off yet. A good Championship loan seems the likeliest option next season.  Everton: Moise Kean In theory, he’s still in the first year of a two-year loan at Juventus with an obligation to buy at the end of it. In theory. In reality, Juventus weren’t right sure a while ago and since signing Dusan Vlahovic are less convinced still about the merits of Kean who has scored just four goals in 24 Serie A games this season. All the noise suggests Juventus are looking to get out of the current arrangement and send Kean back to Goodison this summer, an outcome that we have to imagine absolutely nobody else involved wants. So whatever happens next it should be fun to see what comes of it all.  Leeds: Helder Costa In and out of the side at Valencia but has made no secret of the fact he’s happier in Spain and would like to make his move permanent if everyone else is up for it. They probably will be. “I feel better here, I came from a not so good situation (at Leeds). But Valencia have given me the opportunity to relaunch my career and I think this is the ideal place to do that,” Costa toldSuper Sport last year.   Leicester City: Dennis Praet A victim of the Dreaded Metatarsal, which has kept him out of the Torino side for a couple of months at a frustrating time and appears likely now to be a season-ender. The Belgian is apparently happy in Turin and keen to stay, but the Italian side seem keen to use his injury as a means to drive down the agreed £12.5m option price in the current loan arrangement. Reports from the Italian end suggest Torino might favour another loan over an outright purchase but, with just two year left on his Leicester contract, you’d imagine the Foxes would want something more concrete built into that. An obligation that kicks in once a set number of appearances is reached or some such thing. We don’t know. We’re not contract negotiators.  Liverpool: Nathaniel Phillips It’s between Phillips and Neco Williams here. Both will still have three years left on their contracts in the summer. Both are on loan at high-flying Championship clubs. Both have obvious talent. Both face significant top-quality barriers to their first-team progression at Anfield. But it’s Phillips, five years Williams’ senior, for whom the clock is more conspicuously ticking. Phillips did an admirable job in that desperate half-season for Liverpool last year when all their other centre-backs fell over, but is that situation going to present itself again? Should Bournemouth confirm promotion back to the Premier League, and that appears almost certain now given their sizeable cushion in both points and games in hand over third-placed Luton, you’d imagine both player and club might be keen on a more permanent arrangement. Ticklish thing there is that longish contract, half a season of decent Premier League football behind him and apparent absence of any option in his loan contract. What would Liverpool want for him? £15m is a number that has been touted, and if anything you’d be surprised if it was that low really.  Manchester City: Pedro Porro Just the 13 City players currently plying their trade elsewhere at the mo. Spain right-back Porro is perhaps the most interesting of those, currently in the second half of a successful two-year stint in Lisbon with Sporting that has already brought one league title and could yet bring another if a six-point gap to Porto can be overturned. Eight goals and nine assists from 65 games played predominantly at right wing-back are eye-catching numbers.  Manchester United: Donny van de Beek The arrival of a new manager in the summer means all things are a bit up in the air for United’s current loanees, who could suddenly find themselves far more in favour when a new man arrives. We suspect minds have been made up now, though, about Anthony Martial. Van de Beek is an intriguing one, though. Especially if United’s new manager does turn out to be his former Ajax gaffer Erik Ten Hag in spite of Louis van Gaal’s mischief-making. Van de Beek is clearly a talent, but whether he can crack it here remains in some doubt. What is not is that he is yet to be presented with an environment to categorically prove it one way or the other. In hindsight – and, if we’re honest, foresight – packing him off to Frank Lampard’s Everton Circus might not have been a brilliant idea. We’re still really none the wiser about him.  Newcastle: Freddie Woodman If you were loaned out by Newcastle in January then really it’s a pretty clear hint about where your future lies. For Woodman, who played four Premier League games at the start of the season, it’s meant sitting on the bench for promotion-chasing Bournemouth as back-up to Mark Travers. It is the seventh loan of his Newcastle career, and he has one year left on his contract at St James’ Park. At 25, it’s surely time for a permanent move to go and be first choice somewhere even if it means dropping down a tier or two.  Norwich: Todd Cantwell Like Norwich themselves, he’s pretty good at getting into the Premier League but not so good at staying there. With his current loan club Bournemouth set to once again swap divisions with parent club Norwich, the logical conclusion is surely for Cantwell to go back to Norwich and complete what would be the genuinely novel achievement of a third successive promotion from the Championship. Bournemouth do, though, hold the option of making the move permanent and spoiling everything.  Southampton: Dan N’Lundulu Because there is literally nobody else other than a 23-year-old striker who scored two goals in 20 League One appearances across a pair of loans at first Lincoln and then Cheltenham before suffering a season-ending hamstring injury.  Tottenham: Bryan Gil Spurs have seven players out on loan, and with most of them the future looks pretty clear one way or the other. It would be a major surprise were Tanguy Ndombele or Giovani Lo Celso to have futures in north London, which is a shame but also probably for the best. Neither has been missed since January. Jack Clarke was Spurs’ attempt at a moneyball signing and it’s not worked out. Cameron Carter-Vickers is likely to make his loan move to Celtic permanent. Pape Sarr, the teenage midfield sensation bought from and loaned straight back to Metz last summer, will require a decision but not a final one. The suspicion there is that he’ll spend pre-season with Spurs before either being brought into the first-team squad or sent on another loan. Spurs, you’d imagine, would prefer that to be to either a bottom-half Premier League club or ambitious Championship side (let’s face it, it will probably be Norwich) to find out how he goes in English football. But the big decision probably regards Bryan Gil, the skilful yet painfully lightweight Spanish winger who just looked nowhere near the right sort of fit for English football. His current loan in Spain cannot tell us much but he is the one player on the Spurs list where all things are possible. This time next year he could just as easily be a Spurs first-team regular, starring for Valencia in La Liga having joined on a permanent basis, doing bits for Crystal Palace on loan or languishing at Tottenham having subsisted on the occasional Europa night which is no longer an option because Spurs have found some new and absurdly Spursy way to get knocked out. Watford: Philip Zinckernagel The Hornets look to be on to a good thing whatever happens here thanks to Zinckernagel’s Nottingham Forest exploits. He’s scored five goals and laid on nine assists to help Forest into the play-off picture, but it’s his eye-catching displays in Forest’s fabulous FA Cup run that really make you take notice. If Watford stay up, then he has shown he can play at Premier League level. If they go down, then he has shown he can propel a Championship promotion bid. And if Watford go down and Forest go up, then they might be able to sell him for a nice price. Win, win, win. If you ignore the whole ‘relegation’ stuff, which is not a win and frankly a bit of a downer.  West Ham: Conor Coventry Because he’s the only West Ham player currently out on loan. They really don’t have a very big squad. The 22-year-old spent the first half of this season in the lower reaches of the Championship, making 12 appearances – mainly off the bench – for Peterborough, and is now in League One with MK Dons. Has just a year left on his contract at West Ham, for whom he has made three brief appearances off the bench in the League Cup.  Wolves: Adama Traore All appeared sorted when he set off to Barcelona initially on loan with a £29m option to make it permanent in the summer. Four assists in 10 games have gone some way to confirming the suspicion that his end-product stats might improve away from Wolves but there is yet a fly in the ointment thanks to Barcelona’s much-publicised financial problems making that £29m a bit steep for them. Wolves have made it clear that Traore is done at Molineux unless there’s a surprise U-turn on a new contract and even then Wolves may feel he’s burned his bridges. Spurs were keen in January, but might have moved on now. Could get tricky, this. ",positive,chelsea

An own goal from James Tarkowski had the Clarets 1-0 down at Vicarage Road on Saturday before late goals from Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill turned the game on its head. The comeback victory lifted them five points clear of the relegation zone before Everton beat Chelsea 1-0 on Sunday to close the gap back up to two points. Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature Michael Jackson has now won three matches in a row as caretaker manager after Burnley sacked Sean Dyche last month but Keane thought their celebrations gotunnecessarily out of hand. Keane said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football: “Big win obviously to come from a goal down, you see the reaction there. Obviously I don’t mind the manager celebrating but when I see everyone hugging and kissing I think it’s just slightly over the top.” Presenter Dave Jones interjected: “These are big results at stake aren’t they?” Keane continued: “I know, I know. But there has been all season. I think Dyche would’ve got the same results I really do but, listen, the decision is made now but there’s been a good reaction.” Jones then touched on Burnley’s good form and asked Jamie Carragher if that trend is continuing, to which the former Liverpool defender replied: “Yeah, I mean, I think Roy is right, we said that last week. Sometimes a different voice, maybe a slight change, you think of the impact it has maybe had on Dwight McNeil. “He did a great job, Sean Dyche, but it’s something a little bit different. If you just look at the numbers, and of course we’re only talking about four games, so that can be skewed because that’s such a great start. “But when you see the points and the goals, there’s obviously a huge uplift there because they’ve had such a great start. But I think the thing you look at when you go down is goals conceded as well and that’s something you always looked at with Sean Dyche’s team. “I see everyone hugging and kissing – I think it’s slightly over the top” 😤 Roy Keane was NOT happy with these Burnley celebrations ❌ pic.twitter.com/dH1Zhksa7E — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 2, 2022 “But, as I said, it’s only four games. The possession is slightly up. Percentage of passes long, a slight difference, we saw that in the goal last week when we went through the goals, you know, playing through the lines a bit more. “And the 10 plus pass sequences is a real big jump. So it looks like the manager is trying to put his own stamp on it. He’s going to try and keep the good things of Sean Dyche, keeping it right, but they’re playing a bit more football. “So they’ve almost changed slightly to play a bit more football, shall we say…”  ",positive,chelsea

The ‘Wizard’s’ last home game for Manchester United emphasised his misspent quality. For Manchester United – a club in turmoil, in need of calm heads, desperate for humility amid the arrogance, quality amid the mediocre – to hand Juan Mata his first Premier League start of the season in May is an absolute nonsense. The ‘Wizard’, denied legendary status in the Premier League through Red Devil mismanagement and ill-thought-out strategy, trotted around Old Trafford on Monday, working hard, creating and – perhaps most importantly – caring, to give the United fans a final glimpse of what they should have seen far more of in seven-and-a-half years of wasted talent. Mata arrived at the club having won back-to-back player of the year awards with Chelsea, as one of the Premier League’s foremost creators. He contributed the same number of assists (32) in two-and-half seasons at Chelsea as he has in the rest of his decade-long stint in the English top flight. He very nearly surpassed his Chelsea tally on Monday. It was prime Mata. Having wandered over to the left wing from his floating No.10 role, he beautifully cushioned a volley to Bruno Fernandes on halfway, beat the offside trap to spin in behind, received the return ball, before weighting a cross perfectly into Cristiano Ronaldo’s path. Had CR7 held his run by half a second, Mata’s brilliance would not have been in vain. And that is, in a way, an excellent summary of his United career, as Ronaldo – like his club – failed to take advantage of Mata’s quality. As Gary Neville referenced on commentary, the signing of Mata in January 2014 is in hindsight seen as the first of many signs of post-Fergie fuzzy-thinking. Having signed Marouane Fellaini six months before, David Moyes opted for the polar opposite as his second and final signing. Neither the Belgian brute nor the diminutive graduate of the Real Madrid academy were midfielders like any other in the preceding 20 years at Old Trafford, and have since been deemed unsuited to the hustle and bustle ‘attack, attack, attack’ of United. That speaks to perhaps the biggest problem at United in Mata’s time at the club – the obsession to cling to the coattails of Sir Alex Ferguson and maintain a style of football they’ve never got close to matching. Mata, and many signings since, haven’t been a good fit for that United, but maybe, just maybe, it’s the attempted style that’s been the greatest hindrance to the club’s progress, rather than the undoubtedly talented footballers that have failed to reach the heights they scaled at other clubs. Having said that, this victory over Brentford, Mata’s only start of the season, which admittedly felt a bit like a testimonial, was as close to a Sir Alex Ferguson-like performance as any we’ve seen this term. They broke quickly, with Mata, Fernandes and Ronaldo laying balls off smartly, accurately and running beyond each other. It was – and this hasn’t been the case for far too long – entertaining football. And entertainment has been the name of Juan Mata’s game in the Premier League. He’s put smiles on the faces of fans and teammates alike with unlikely assists, delicate touches and stunning long-range strikes. But most of those fond memories came in Chelsea blue, before a United career blighted by managers who failed to appreciate what he could do if they used him effectively. He leaves the Premier League with his head held high but with an irrefutable sense offrustration at what could have been.  ",positive,chelsea

Meanwhile, Ralf Rangnick could return to Leipzig for a midfielder… LIVERPOOL KEEN ON CRANKY CAMAVINGA Eduardo Camavinga only joined Real Madrid in the summer, when Manchester United were thought to be interested in the France midfielder. But having struggled to secure a place in Carlo Ancelotti’s first XI, there is already talk of the teenager looking for another move. Camavinga has managed only six starts in all competitions for Real this season, which has prompted El Nacional to link him to Liverpool. Apparently, the 19-year-old ‘has a monumental rage’ over his situation at Real and is open to loan or permanent offers, and Jurgen Klopp is still keen to take the former Rennes star. Having done a deal to sign Camavinga in the summer which could cost them up to £35million, Real are said to want a profit on the midfielder.  Top 10 Under-21 Premier League stars of 2021  RANGNICK RETURNS TO LEIPZIG FOR MIDFIELDER United are also looking for midfielders, though not with replacing Paul Pogba in mind. Fabrizio Romano says the Red Devils’ renewal offer to Pogba is still on the table, where it has been since the summer. There are no negotiations with other clubs over a possible January sale, while Pogba is still said to be assessing his options. Indeed, the Mirror reports that if Pogba wants to leave United next month, he will have to push for a move. But Ralf Rangnick is still exploring the market for midfielders and the Mirror reckons the United boss could make contact with former club RB Leipzig to discuss a deal for Amadou Haidara. The story goes that Rangnick is looking for a tall and dominating presence in midfield and 23-year-old Haidara could fit the bill. Even if he is only 5ft 9in…  SPURS EYE SERIE A-BASED CENTRE-BACKS Tottenham are scouring the market for centre-backs and this morning are linked with a couple from Antonio Conte’s neck of the woods… Spurs have had a previous interest in Stefan de Vrij and Rai Sport reckons Conte’s arrival has reignited their desire to land the Inter Milan defender. De Vrij is entering the final 18 months of his contract at the San Siro, where he played for Conte before the manager moved on. The Sun rehashes a report from Swiss website 4-4-2.com that suggests Spurs are keen on Matthijs De Ligt – but they won’t pay the ridiculous release clause that comes into play next summer. De Ligt could leave Juventus for around £130million at the end of the season, with Barcelona and Chelsea interested. But those clubs too would also be looking to negotiate on that figure.

Ronaldo returned to the Red Devils last summer. This followed his prolific spells at Real Madrid and Juventus. The 37-year-old has been criticised at times this season but his contribution in terms of goals cannot be disputed. Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters The forward has netted 23 goals from his 37 appearances across all competitions this term. This includes eight goals in his last five Premier League games. Last time out he earned United a point at Old Trafford against Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea. The Blues were by far the better side on the night but they did not make the most of their chances. Keane argued post-match that Ronaldo would score even more goals if he played for Chelsea: “I know people are quick to criticise what [Ronaldo] doesn’t do in terms of his pressing but he was never great at that anyway,” Keane said (quotes via Football London). “He is the greatest at what is the hardest part of the game, putting the ball in the back of the net. “You see the chances that Chelsea were creating. Imagine if he was in the Chelsea team, he’d probably get 50 goals. He’s in a poor Manchester United team who aren’t creating many chances for him and he’s producing.” Keane also stated that there was a problem with the “attitude” of Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku: After signing for £97.5m from Inter Milan in the summer transfer window, Lukaku was expected to hit the ground running at Chelsea but has managed just ten goals in 37 appearances in all competitions. And Keane didn’t like what he saw from the Chelsea striker on Thursday night with the Man Utd legend expecting Lukaku to attempt to prove a point against his former club. Keane said on Sky Sports: “He’s come on against Man United, he was [a player] here, so you think, ‘I’ll show them my qualities’. He came on and again, just ambling along, not that determination to get himself a goal. As much as his fitness levels, I think his attitude doesn’t seem right.” ",positive,chelsea

Get your views in to theeditor@football365.com… Why Evertonians are behind Lampard There’s been an awful lot of guff about Frank Lampard on these pages recently, from your writers and mailboxes alike. Some of it borne out of rivalry; some, presumably, out of jealousy and spite. (Why on earth would a fan of another club care whether he deserves the EFC job or not, if such a thing could even be assessed?) So, I thought I’d try to articulate why I and many other Evertonians are inclined to defend him. Firstly, the mess at the club is not his fault. Our squad was compiled by no less than 8 different managers, together with 2 different DoFs and 2 board members who each have/had their own opinions. Some of those people were absolutely useless at their jobs. Many of the managers have opposing styles and some even seem to have been appointed as a direct reaction to the previous (different) playing style not working out. One mailboxer said that Lampard has had access to resources many clubs can’t dream of. Has he though? We are hamstrung by FFP rules now and he joined with only a few days of the transfer window remaining when we’d already conducted most of our business at the behest of the previous manager and DoF (a fine example of the complete lack of planning at the top level – I mean, selling Luca Digne to please Benitez and then firing Benitez almost immediately afterwards really takes le gateau). We had a world class number 10 in Rodriguez whom Benitez banished to the gulf because of a grudge held since they were in Madrid together many years ago and our other number 10 has been dropped from the squad because he’s [redacted for legal reasons]. Our best defender (Mina) has legs made of cheese and our main striker has been injured for much of the season and now seems more bothered about chasing modelling gigs than loose balls in the box. Secondly, there are reasons to like and have faith in what he says. Martinez was unrelentingly positive to the point of gaslighting, Allardyce tried to claim Unsworth’s results as his own, Koeman seemed to think he was above it all and Benitez was thoroughly dour (and was never going to be one of us) but Frank genuinely seems pleased to be here and is actually telling it like it is. Yes, he has complained about refs but we’ve had some shocking decisions go against us during his tenure and he’s not made a habit of it like many others do. When we’ve played well, he’s complimented the team; when we’ve shown a complete lack of bollocks, he’s not been afraid to call them out too. F365 has picked up on him pointing to the state of results before we came but he’s right – they were absolutely shite. Thirdly, there are signs that we are moving in the right direction. We are playing passes around again (ok, except against the red shite), pressing again and showing some fight again. Iwobi looks like a different player, Gordon is improving by the week (needs to learn to stay on his feet, mind), Mykolenko seems to have settled nicely now and we’ve even seen flashes (if only flashes so far) of what Dele Alli can do. The challenge is achieving consistency now and preventing Keane and Holgate from being distracted by passing bumblebees. Who knows? Stranger things have happened. Finally, well, sooner or later we’ve got to back someone right? I’ve had friends who follow other clubs tell me that we should sack him and bring Allardyce back for the last few games. To me, that’s madness and the exact sort of knee-jerk decision making is what got us into this mess in the first place. Maybe Lampard will prove to be a very good manager, maybe he won’t and we’ll get relegated. Either way, though, I believe he deserves a proper chance (and from you lot too). BestPhilT Big Weekend: Newcastle v Liverpool, Phillips against Man City, Arsenal, Lampard faces Chelsea  Is Klopp’s Liverpool’s greatest-ever signing? I write this moments after the news of Klopp signing of a new contract that keeps him at the club until 2026. I was so happy that I can’t remember the last time I was this happy about a current LFC employee signing a contract extension. It got me thinking, is Jurgen Klopp the greatest signing in the history of LFC? There are many contenders but for me it comes down to three, Kenny Dalglish, Bill Shankly, Jurgen Klopp. I’m not old enough to have seen a Bill Shankly side but we obviously know his legend and my dad has told me enough times to know what this man did for the club, he took us from the old 2nd division and made us the champions three times under his stewardship as well as two FA cups and a UEFA cup. But it wasn’t just the trophies he won that made him so revered, as we’re seeing with Klopp now he changed the whole ethos of the club, he turned a crumbling local football club into league and European champions and what he put in place stayed for years and helped turn the club into behemoth we see today. Again I was too young to see Kenny Dalglish play in his pomp but from old video and tales off my pops I know all too well that he was one of the greatest players to ever pull on a red shirt. He won 7 league titles and 3 European cups as well as a number of FA/league cups. He was a magician with the ball at his feet and scored some wondrous goals and to this day my dad says there will never be another Dalglish, he said that Suarez came closest to what Dalglish brought to the team. What sets Dalglish apart is that he transferred his winning playing style to management too winning the league twice and two FA cups as manager. He was also the rock that the whole city clung to in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster. He’s still a massive figure at the club today with a stand named after him and all the respect and adulation that he deserves. Jurgen Klopp. What else can I say that hasn’t already been said, the man is a genius and much like Shankley before him he rejuvenated a sleeping giant and turned us into one of if not the best side in Europe for a number of years winning the league and Champions league in the face of financially doped opposition. He’s put into place an ethos and a system that should see us well for years after he leaves and he’ll leave a lasting legacy on the club much like the men I’ve already mentioned. So to answer my question, is Jurgen Klopp the greatest signing in the history of the football club? No, not yet. That title goes to Sir Kenneth Mathieson Dalglish but for Klopp just be in the conversation with him and Shankley speaks volumes. To the mailbox, who is the greatest signing in the history of your club?MickT Liverpool  Second place is first loserDom Littleford, no-one cares about the second tallest man and no-one who isn’t a Liverpool fan will have them as a great team for Rumbelows cup wins or losing the league by 11mm (trust Liverpool fans, inventors of the net spend league and the VAR league to add a further measure of total irrelevance just to make them sleep better at night. How about a slip measure too?). Trophies are what matters and now it is pretty much just winning the league or Champions league that really matter in terms of going down as a good side. Even the FA Cup is only the 3rd most prestigious trophy for an English club. That’s not to say any premiership team wouldn’t love to be lifting that trophy at Wembley, especially those not in the top 2 places currently. Ask Greg Norman about greatness. Ranked number one golfer in the world for a total of 331 weeks (over 6 years), only surpassed by Tiger yet “only” won two majors. Because of this he is not even close to a conversation of the greats. There’s a big difference in being great and actually achieving greatness. Without the trophies to back up a claim you’re just an old man with biased rose tinted memories. And “the two best English clubs of all time” – LOLJon, Cape Town (it is difficult enough to separate those that win trophies making discarding those without them very easy)  …Dom’s email was perfectly reasonable in most of what it said, but I think it misses the basic point that most people are making; it’s not that this season’s Liverpool team wouldn’t be considered great, but that they’d have no claim to be amongst the very greats/the greatest. Take the 2016 Golden State Warriors in basketball Vs the 1996 Chicago Bulls. The Warriors had the better record (73 wins, 9 losses), to the Bulls 72-10, but crucially, they lost in the finals, whilst the Bulls won. The raw number might have showed they were better statistically, but so what? When the pressure was really on, they couldn’t get the job done. If Liverpool were to get 100+ points this season and finish second, not winning anything bar the Carabao, they’d be the greatest amongst all of the failures and almost greats in sport. They’d be right at the top of the list of teams that were so close, yet couldn’t get the job done. They’d be admired and revered in much the same way Charles Barkley’s Phoenix Sounds are – wonderful losers. They’d go down as another “if only…”. It’s also ludicrous to suggest a team that got 7 extra points but didn’t win the league could ever be remembered as being greater than the Invincibles, or even as great. Arsenal won the league comfortably, scored the most goals, and kept the most clean sheets. A fair number of the draws came towards the end of the season, when it was clear that going undefeated was within touching distance. They survived the pressure of achieving that historical feat. Liverpool didn’t. They finished a mighty second. A behemoth? Has there even been a behemoth quite like Sir Alex’s Man Utd? Let’s not belittle by trying to overly compare eras. It’s also petty to single out a Pires moment to retract from it. Can we not arbitrarily pick out any number of moments in any team’s season to say “they wouldn’t have done it but for X, Y, Z”? There will always be that element of luck, or something “wrong” contributing along the way to anything like that. Klopp’s teams have certainly had their moments. This isn’t about being the second tallest guy in history. It’s more so about being the second tallest that year, let alone in all of history. You could reasonably argue that some of the Real Madrid teams that finished second to Barca were great, but you hardly hear mention of them now that years have passed – and so it should be. Second won’t make them the second greatest team in history, nor does winning the league this year make Pep’s team the greatest ever. Tall as they are, if Liverpool her dunked on by Pep’ team, that will be what everyone remembers, except the nostalgic Liverpool fans who still go on about “if only Gerrard hadnt slipped…”. Enjoy,Soheil.  Stopping Salah Alot of comparison of Grealish and Salah’s rates of getting fouled per minute, foul per dribble or whatever in the afternoon mailbox – is it racism, Liverpool bias or whatever (I’m not getting into that). Isn’t the big factor that people are overlooking style of play? It seems to me that Salah gets fewer fouls because he’s good enought to power through and just score a goal instead. When I watch Grealish, he doesn’t really try and score goals, or create goalscoring opportunities, I honestly think that he’s playing almost exclusively to try and draw a foul. People are trying to suggest that there should be direct correlation between quality of player and fouls won, but while difficulty to play against is clearly a factor, its not the only factor. Someone flagged that Messi gets fouled significantly less often than Grealish and for me, that says everything. For Messi, a good days work is bagging a couple of goals and maybe an assist. For Grealish, its luring at least four people into kicking his shin in attacking areas. Salah is more Messi than Grealish – that’s a good thing!Andy (MUFC)  …Has anyone considered that Mo Salah’s low fouls per minute / per dribble / per whatever are so low because the guy is the world’s best and nobody can get close enough to him to foul him? Same can’t be said for Grealish, Gordon or anyone else. Seems like an obvious explanation.Mark, LFC, Hong Kong  …Lots of people upset at me suggesting Salah gets fewer decisions because of the colour of his skin. There’s lots of unconscious bias in every aspect of our lives. There are numerous studies that prove it (e.g. people with certain types of names being less likely to be invited to interviews, having a certain skin colour resulting in it being more likely you’re searched by the police). Sometimes these biases exist because an individual might be racist and sometimes they exist because of endemic or institutional types of racism. I am also glad that everyone tells us that the most fouled players include Zaha and Toney and therefore statistically I must be wrong. Someone also suggested I should engage my brain on this basis. Thankfully I did engage my brain before I wrote in in the first place and looking at most fouled players in the league is basically the most stupid way possible of using statistics. If you can accept that a more accurate way of representing who’s getting a disproportionate number of decisions would be touches per foul then the data shows…. Zaha still up there – a foul every 12 touches Maddison – 15 Grealish – 18 Pulisic – 18 Kane/Vardy/Bowen/Sterling – 25 Salah – 61 I totally get that lots of white people prefer to bury their heads in the sand and not think that anything is to do with skin colour. The claims of “There’s no racism issue in Britain” carries about as much weight as the people who claim there’s no paedophiles in the Angola (where the age of consent is 12 years old). Accepting there is a possibility of some kind of weird non-football reason why someone like Salah gets fewer decisions per touch doesn’t close off discussions about racism like one mailboxer suggested in the afternoon. If anything it is helpful because if the PGMOL or UEFA did try to understand what unconscious explanation existed for it then they could train officials to eliminate whatever it might be. Whilst I did imply it was a race issue I am really open to the possibility that it could be all sorts of other things resulting in this outcome. The question is – can anyone from the afternoon mailbox actually think through what I’ve said above and accept it just might be a race issue?Minty, LFC  …Lee’s mail was a great example of how badly statistics can get mangled in the wrong hands. First off, pointing to the fact that Salah has only one card for diving doesn’t mean he doesn’t regularly dive. You can do it while being really good at conning the referee, so that’s an oversimplistic conclusion. Anyone who watches Salah knows that, like most modern attackers, he does like to go down easy from time to time. ‘He is literally the harshest treated wide forward in all of Europe by referees. That not even hyperbole it’s just statistical fact’ he goes on to claim, pointing to numbers relating to how often he gets free-kicks. Nope, it’s hyperbole. To do a proper analysis, you’d need to consider some of the (countless) variables at play, such as, just for starters, how many times each player gets tackled per 90 mins. You might consider that, fabulous player that he is, Salah often finds himself with large amounts of space to run into and defenders can’t catch him. Liverpool are all about those quick turnovers and when it works, they are often in oodles of space. Conversely, with Grealish, it doesn’t matter if he’s ‘not on Salah’s level’. It matters more the type of player he is, especially as the seasons referred to in his data are presumably the three before this. Grealish was the go-to guy making runs from midfield for Villa, switching wings, taking it in tight areas, looking to draw fouls to alleviate pressure, and dare I say it, going down easy from time to time. It stands to reason that a player like that is fouled more. Perhaps Salah is that intelligent a player he moves it as quickly as possible and doesn’t take too many touches like Grealish tends to do. As for the thing regarding teams with English attackers getting more penalties, this looks a spurious correlation. Looks more like 4 of the Top 5 league places were in the Top 5, along with one outlier, in Brighton. This would be expected. Both City and Brighton were on 9, followed by Newcastle on 7. And then 5 teams (25% of the league) all stuck on 6. It almost sounds like the data is normally distributed, and there’s some chance variation going on, but you can’t come to many conclusions without doing lots of stretching. Of course we’d be able to assess this better if Lee actually linked to all the data he is talking about. If he does want to know more about how correlation is not causation, he should Google ‘spurious correlations’, and learn about the TERRIFYING link between high cheese consumption and people dying by getting tangled up in bedsheets.Pablo, MUFC, Dublin, getting that stats party started…. Football’s greatest mystery How can a team spend a billion to become this bad? Opposition players must be p*ssing themselves laughing how easy it is to play against United!Manyooligan (Do Telles and Rashford even realize the problem is on their flank???) SoC  …You know on closer inspection that Ronaldo lad is really good at football. He’s probably not the problem at Man United.Robbie DFC  …Imagine thinking Ronaldo was the issue. With a team like Liverpool or City, he would have scored over 50 goals this season across all competitions. Single handedly carrying a below par United across the finishing line. This season should be counted as one of his finest, seeing what kind of a team he is playing for and how much impact he single handedly has had on the season. I can count atleast 10-12 separate occasions where he has won us some points and carried us in a game. On the other hand you got 100m Lukaku, 71m Havertz & 50m Werner who all combined still do not possess half the skill Ronaldo does, or else it would have been 5-1.Aman (Great ball by Matic though, twice in two weeks now)   ",positive,chelsea
https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-everton-1-0-chelsea-substance-over-style-relegation-dogfight,Everton substance over style earns Lampard huge Chelsea scalp in relegation dogfight,"It was a huge win for Chelsea legend Frank Lampard’s Everton, who played with the fight and desire befitting what is turning into quite the relegation battle. It was as frustrated as Chelsea have looked, and they’ve played this game at least 25 times this season. They had 78 per cent of the ball, did nothing with it and allowed themselves to be riled by Everton. Kai Havertz was the case in point. He had 30 touches in the first half but none in the box and spent most of the time being wound up by Yerry Mina, who dealt with him brilliantly. Everton were aggressive and defended as one. The problem, if you can call it one, was their inability to string more than two passes together. Abdoulaye Doucoure was excellent, Fabian Delph was typically dynamic, but neither of them were able to put their foot on the ball and dictate play for more than a few seconds. They were relying on a Chelsea mistake, which Cesar Azpilicueta dutifully proferred shortly after half-time. The Chelsea captain had plenty of time to play the ball long for Reece James or pass it back to Edouard Mendy, did neither and was robbed by Richarlison, who calmly slotted the ball into the corner. The ploy to frustrate that ended in defeat to Liverpool is a viable method against this Chelsea side, who have been profligate in one box and mistake-ridden in the other for weeks. Bide your time and they will hand you a reward for your patience and hard work. And as Chelsea tried to break out of their funk, with Jordan Pickford making one brilliant save to deny Azpilicueta after Mason Mount hit both posts, before getting the ball smashed in the chops from the resulting corner, Everton could easily have doubled their lead as Richarlison continued to be buzz around and irritate the Chelsea defence. The Brazilian was at his pestering best and had to be replaced in the 80th minute, having run himself into the ground. It wasn’t pretty from Everton. There was very little skill and only fleeting quality to speak of, but they did the ugly stuff so well. It’s as though they have now finally realised they’re in a relegation battle and – roared on by the Goodison Park crowd – are weighting their efforts hugely in favour of substance over style. That’s absolutely how it should be. Frank Lampard, frequently criticised for his inability to organise his teams defensively, both in his time at Chelsea and more recently with Everton, played this one perfectly. They sat deep for the majority of the game, allowing no space for Havertz or Timo Werner to hurt them in behind, pushing up occasionally to press in packs and harass what is an increasingly shaky Chelsea backline into mistakes. And they fully deserved the victory. Pickford did make some world class saves, but an Everton xG of 1.82 to Chelsea’s 0.94 illustrates just how effective the home side were compared to their opponents. They played Chelsea at a good time – Thomas Tuchel’s side don’t appear to have anything left in the tank this season – but if Everton can harness the passion they showed on Sunday and use that as the bedrock for their remaining five games, they will still be a Premier League outfit next season.

https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-premier-league-winners-losers-everton-zaha-arteta-norwich-marsch,"Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature","Everton will do well to remember that ritual again this season. Wilfried Zaha gets praise but Norwich, Watford and Jesse Marsch do not. Winners Everton Any Everton supporter with a proclivity for ritualisation might find these last few weeks of the season particularly taxing. It is basic human nature to superstitiously recreate certain behaviours and practices – wearing a supposedly ‘lucky’ item of clothing or following a specific morning routine – in the hope of capturing that same positive energy. Fans might not be able to control what the players do, but if setting off early morning fireworks outside the opposition hotel, carrying an incredibly tranquil dog aloft through a raucous crowd, noisily welcoming the team bus, playing a game of catch with Richarlison and a flare and hiding the match ball up your jumper during stoppage time preceded a crucial victory over the reigning world and European champions, it might be worth trying again for the last five fixtures. Everton will be petrified of changing anything, considering how long it has taken to stumble upon a formula that works. After three wins and a draw in their opening four games, the longest unbeaten run the Toffees have been on in the Premier League this season is two matches. That surely has to change at some point before the end of the campaign for them to survive. But after watching that gap to safety extend to five points before kick-off on Sunday, Everton finally produced under pressure against Chelsea. It was a dogged, determined performance typified by Jordan Pickford’s brilliance, Yerry Mina’s snide and the industry of Demarai Gray and Richarlison, who combined for the winner. The only negative is that Frank Lampard’s side have two fixtures remaining at Goodison Park in comparison to three more trips away. Stock up on sparklers, prepare the calm canines and wear the baggiest clothes possible for that four-day period in which Brentford and Crystal Palace visit Merseyside, because Everton are 10th in a home table – and bottom, at least three points behind every other team in an away one – for a reason. Everton substance over style earns Lampard huge Chelsea scalp in relegation dogfight  BurnleyWhile there were 5,787 days between the amassing of Michael Jackson’s seven UK number ones, the accrual of ten Premier League points has taken Mike Jackson barely a fortnight. Burnley have won three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since April 2019. That same sequence of results – 2-0 against Wolves, 1-3 at Bournemouth and 2-0 against Cardiff – just so happens to contain the previous instance of the Clarets coming from behind to win away in the league. An Ashley Barnes own goal gifted Eddie Howe’s Cherries a fourth-minute lead but the striker rounded off the scoring early in the second half to complete a fine recovery. Three years later, James Tarkowski handed Watford the advantage after eight minutes by accidentally rebounding a shot into his own net. Barnes was central to their revival again, an inspired substitute for Wout Weghorst with half an hour remaining. It changed the angle and method of attack and Watford could not sustain the pressure. This unorthodox caretaker reign has reignited a fading survival bid but also reinvigorated a squad which looked quietly fractured and bereft. The Clarets have scored six goals in four games since Sean Dyche’s departure, each from different players in Wout Weghorst, Connor Roberts, Nathan Collins, Matej Vydra and now the unlikeliest double act of Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill. That the result effectively relegated Watford, barring a miracle, could have a further uplifting effect on one of the most tightly-knit squads around; seeing the pain of the drop first-hand sharpens the collective focus to avoid it. Burnley are finally on course to do just that. Michael Jackson has only been in charge of Burnley since 15 April and already has more Premier League points (10) than any Watford manager has taken this season (Munoz 7, Ranieri 6, Hodgson 9). — Richard Jolly 🇺🇦 (@RichJolly) May 1, 2022   Wilfried Zaha and Patrick VieiraThe situation could hardly have been managed any better. Patrick Vieira noted that Leeds wanted to have their cake and eat it, targeting Wilfried Zaha and fouling him four times before Kalvin Phillips tarred the Crystal Palace forward with a familiar brush.“For someone who dives so much, he has an awful lot of bruises on his ankles,” his manager said, explaining why Zaha started on the bench against Southampton. There was a time when that would have been an automatic signal of defeat for Palace. Zaha was their talisman, without whom they had little hope of operating functionally. He remains integral but this is a solid side that is adorned by his brilliance, rather than solely reliant upon it. Four minutes after Eberechi Eze’s equaliser against Southampton, Vieira threw Zaha on for the final half an hour with the express intention of occupying the home defence as a centre-forward – “We put him in the No.9 because of his mobility and the fact he can hold the ball and run in-behind” – and the results were resounding. Southampton are Zaha’s most frequent opponent. He has faced them 20 times. But his last few visits to St Mary’s had ranged from forgettable to a frustrating exhibition of his main weakness. The 29-year-old constantly toes the line and while he crossed the wrong side in rising to the provocation of James Ward-Prowse and being sent off in February 2019, Zaha somehow resisted the temptation to celebrate in the Southampton midfielder’s face upon his sublime stoppage-time winner. This is already the highest-scoring season of his career and it is no coincidence that he no longer feels the burden of constantly having to drag Palace up to his level. Vieira has built a team worthy of their crown jewel.  Jurgen KloppFive changes from midweek delivered a fifth 1-0 win of the Premier League season for Liverpool. The nature of those victories sum up Jurgen Klopp’s impeccable squad management, with each delivered by a different scorer: Naby Keita against Newcastle; Sadio Mane against West Ham in March; Fabinho against Burnley in February; Mo Salah against Aston Villa in December; and Divock Origi against Wolves the prior week. Extend it to all competitions and a sixth 1-0 win came from Diogo Jota’s effort against Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup quarter-finals. It is an enduring testament to both their strength in depth and of character.  RodriOne of the key fulcrums behind Manchester City’s unexpected set-piece dominance has been Rodri. They look far tighter defending free-kicks and corners with the midfielder in place, and much more threatening attacking them with him lurking. Perhaps behind only Ederson, it feels like Rodri is the player Pep Guardiola staked his reputation on the most. For a holding midfielder, his defensive instincts were initially poor and that counter-pressing role often proved beyond his capabilities and speed. There were few more polarising Manchester City players at one point: some saw enough to suggest he could eventually provide the necessary foundation for success, while others feared that dominance of the English game might always be just out of Rodri’s reach. He epitomises Guardiola’s reign in that way, by rising above preconceptions and changing the game to his whim instead of the other way around. His teammates have stood out at certain points, but Rodri has been a model of consistency.  Brighton’s scoutsMarc Cucurella was outstanding. Yves Bissouma was excellent. Moises Caicedo looks like an absolute Premier League natural. Enock Mwepu’s versatility has been a welcome addition to his game. Leandro Trossard has that air of a player who could raise his levels to suit the standard of most teams. Robert Sanchez matched his tally of clean sheets from last season. Those six players were signed for combined fees equivalent to the sales of Benjamin White, Anthony Knockaert and Aaron Mooy over the last two years. It is a neat party trick to master, particularly as it does not rely upon a specific manager, although the influence of an excellent coach undeniably helps the process. “We sold Ben and we’ve managed to improve. That’s the challenge in the Premier League for teams like us.It’s impossible to think you can keep hold of everybody. But we can sell at the right time, at the right price, then carry on trying to improve,” was Graham Potter’s message after the win over Wolves. Acknowledging that role in football’s food chain is important; embracing it is crucial. Marc Cucurella is unbelievably good every time I watch Brighton. So technically proficient on the ball, rounded defensive game, and can run the whole flank for the full 90 — Aaron Moniz (@amonizfootball) April 30, 2022   Cristian RomeroPatson Daka was theamuse-bouche that only intensified Cristian Romero’s appetite for his main course of Turkish affright. The halfway second challenge that directly preceded Heung-min Son’s first goal did not resemble a halfway line clash between hardened centre-halves, only because Caglar Soyuncu was entirely consumed by his counterpart. It was a comprehensive clattering. Tottenham would rise to fourth only temporarily, but even if they do eventually miss out on the Champions League there is solace in Romero’s presence. “The difficulty is, what top players are going to go to Spurs?” Roy Keane asked in January, suggesting that qualification for Europe’s premier competition was a prerequisite for attracting the best talent. Romero disproves that  Mikel ArtetaArsenal are another step closer to the ultimate justification. By the close of the January transfer window, Rob Holding had started four Premier League games and Mo Elneny just one. Eddie Nketiah’s only appearances outside of the League Cup by then had lasted no more than 19 minutes off the bench. Yet Mikel Arteta trusted all three to deliver when the inescapable time came that he had to call upon them. The Spaniard will be mocked and criticised by many onlookers but harnessing that sort of squad harmony is a delicate balancing act that only the two coaches competing for the title have managed better. The excellence of youth has underpinned this Arsenal season – Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli assisting the goals was apropos – but this is far more of a team effort than it ever has been a case of individualism.   Losers NorwichThere are deeper reads to be had on Norwich’s demise, but describing it as inevitable is misleading. In this particular season they had every chance of avoiding relegation, armed with a solid budget and the painful lessons of previous failures, with hindsight showing that other clubs could have been pulled further into danger. They should have had every advantage on Brentford, for example, yet 19 points separate the reigning second-tier champions from last season’s play-off winners. The sale of Emiliano Buendia was both predictable and early, yet the Canaries used neither the windfall nor the time nearly well enough. Most importantly, there was once an understanding and acceptance from the supporters, who long put their faith in the project and were sold The Norwich Way as the only way. That self-funded model has felt like a pre-prepared excuse all season. Other clubs have navigated those financial constraints much more convincingly. And unless the culture indelibly changes, even promotion next campaign will come with an undercurrent of trepidation from three successive top-flight relegations. Stuart Webber and his time have a few mountains to climb, not least in terms of getting supporters back onside.  Watford The feeling at Vicarage Road will be similar, albeit their fate has not been officially confirmed and the route by which it will surely be reached is vastly different. There have at least been suggestions that Watford intend on changing their ways by arming a younger manager with time and patience instead of whittling down the never-ending list of names on the combined Pozzo-Duxbury contacts book. But the jury will not expect to reconvene on that anytime soon. The next challenge will be to retain certain portions of the squad, because for all their flaws this is not a team which should be setting records for consecutive top-flight home defeats. Ismaila Sarr, Joao Pedro and Emmanuel Dennis are among those who have been gradually dragged down by an atrocious defence, despite the opposite being true last season when Xisco Munoz built upon a solid backline to gain promotion. There should be more optimism at Watford than Norwich, even if the Roy Hodgson appointment has been an unmitigated disaster for all involved. But Duxbury in particular will have questions to answer, considering he spent last May painstakingly listing all the mistakes the Hornets had learned from ahead of this season. Same again. Imagine being a #WatfordFC sub today and your manager not believing in you enough to bring you on. I hope for Duxbury’s sake the club aren’t relying on any of those subs for next year. — Rob Ezekiel (@Rob_Ezekiel) April 30, 2022   Jesse MarschIt was notable that Frank Lampard and Jesse Marsch echoed similar lines. The former described Everton’s fans as “the 12th man” and thanked them for helping “get us over the line late in the game”. The latter said that “the best part was the fans’ response” and “there was so much passion and love for the team from the fans”. The Leeds manager did stress that “that isn’t pandering to our fans” but it is a tough balance to strike. He and Lampard have both perhaps visited that well a little too often. But the key difference there is that Everton fans – rightly or wrong – welcomed their boss as the replacement for an unpopular figurehead, while Marsch started at a natural disadvantage due to the nature of Marcelo Bielsa’s relationship with the support. Few could blame him for leaning on that aspect of a 4-0 defeat in which Leeds had their chances. And in truth, they are losers mainly because of the worst possible results elsewhere. That five-game unbeaten run immediately before the Manchester City loss is keeping heads barely above water and a run-in of Arsenal, Chelsea, Brighton and Brentford has its pros and cons. Pandering or otherwise, Marsch and his players will need the fans to be in full voice.  ChelseaJose Mourinho, in combination with Steven Gerrard, successfully tricked the world into forgetting Chelsea led the Premier League table as late as April 2014; it was not only Liverpool who capitulated in that title race. On a far lesser scale, Thomas Tuchel might be accompanying his players on a slow slide down this table. The German ought to be thankful that the league season is both over soon, and will require Arsenal to face Tottenham in its penultimate week. Chelsea sit three points ahead of Arsenal and five above Spurs, all having played the same number of games. But only two of those sides have momentum currently in their favour. The Blues are finding it difficult to generate that and after a run of five consecutive Premier League wins, their form has been: L, W, L, W, D, L. Tuchel increasingly looks incapable of rousing them from this slump and preventing the individual mistakes that continue to undermine any hint of progress. The season could yet end with Wembley glory and Tuchel’s strength at Stamford Bridge thus far has been in managing those one-off games. But his reign will ultimately be measured by Premier League progress and that is a nut he still seems unable to crack.  WolvesThat unavoidable sense of flux has returned. Bruno Lage has completed a hat-trick of three successive Premier League defeats. Wolves emerged from that stuttering August start to establish their Champions League credentials, which were firmly ended by losses to Arsenal, West Ham and Crystal Palace in March. That cushion to 9th and below should be substantial enough to prevent goalless setbacks against Newcastle, Burnley and Brighton doing lasting damage, but it is demoralising for a season that promised so much to deliver so little.  The European semi-finalistsConsidering how delicately those Europa League and Europa Conference League semi-finals are poised, West Ham and Leicester’s respective seasons hang in the balance. Both are without a win in their last four Premier League games, starting from the match after their quarter-final second-leg heroics and bleeding into the final matches of their semi-finals. If either progress then that drop-off will be forgotten but it will be difficult to gather anything tangible from the season if they are knocked out in midweek.  SouthamptonA ludicrous football club. Between December 15 and February 25, Southampton went on a run of one defeat in 10 Premier League games. From March 5 to April 30, that has become a sequence of one win in nine. ",positive,chelsea

The summer signings of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho were meant to catapult the Red Devils nearer to the Premier League title but they have gone backwards instead. Man Utd are currently sixth in the Premier League table after a 1-1 draw at home against Chelsea last night with the club needing a minor miracle now to finish ahead of fourth-placed Arsenal before the end of the season. Transfer gossip: Man Utd to move for free-agent Dybala while Arsenal target Rashford Erik ten Hag will take over from interim boss Ralf Rangnick in the summer with many expecting a the Dutchman to take on a big rebuilding job in the summer. Rangnick mentioned there could be as many as ten new signings in the summer but a report in ESPN recently claimed that it was likely to be more like three. When asked if just United’s midfield needed rebuilding, Keane replied on Sky Sports: “Everything. Don’t get me started on the midfield. I think defensively. I’m still not happy with the goalkeeper. A couple of players up front. Huge!” Keane added: “Fernandes doesn’t get the ball back for you. Nobody mentions will he miss out. [Marcus] Rashford doesn’t do nowhere near enough. Sometimes they go to close people down but they are not really going after people, they’re just going through the motions. “We saw that again tonight with the amount of chances Chelsea created because players were going through the motions. Manchester City and Liverpool are the example, they hunt in packs, they hunt with hunger and real desire.

Three matches, at home to Brentford and away at Brighton and Crystal Palace, for fans and many of the players to go through the motions before being able to consign a miserable campaign to the history books and never speak of it again. But is there an opportunity here for United to get a head-start on the Erik ten Hag era? Here are five ways United can salvage something from what’s left of the season… 1) Draw a line under the past by using only the players who will be at United next season We don’t yet know exactly which players they may be. Gary Neville expects Ten Hag to oversee a “brutal transition” and there is no question that a great number will be shown the door this summer. We do know, though, that those out of contract at the end of the season won’t be sticking around. So what is to be gained by playing them now? Granted, of those players approaching free agency, only really Nemanja Matic has been involved regularly of late. Paul Pogba and Edinson Cavani will tell you they are injured; Juan Mata has had the odd cameo; Jesse Lingard had been a regular on the bench prior to being omitted from the squad to face Chelsea. Matic has been involved because of injuries to Scott McTominay and Fred, both of whom should be available for the Bank Holiday game against Brentford. With almost nothing to play for, it serves no-one other than Matic and his prospects of a decent move to play him in the remaining three games. Perhaps allow any number of him, Mata and Lingard a cameo at the end of the Brentford game to say farewell to the home supporters, assuming many of them stick around that long. Pogba and Cavani need not say goodbye given they have long since f***ed off. Man Utd quintet feature in Premier League XI of players ready for step down  2) Blood the youngsters Out with the old, in with the new – the ‘new’, in the short-term at least, being some of the youngsters to have come through United’s academy. Ralf Rangnick gave midfielder Hannibal Mejbri a few minutes at the end of United’s humiliation at Liverpool and forward Alejandro Garnacho had even less time off the bench when he was offered a senior debut in injury time against Chelsea. Now the interim boss has the chance to give each a proper chance to shine rather than just the gesture of a cameo. Similar goes for winger Shola Shoretire and left-back Alvaro Fernandez, who were also primed and ready to come off the bench against Chelsea. In three games against mid-table opposition, with little on the line for either side, rarely will United get the chance to see what these kids can do in a competitive-ish environment.  3) Try Ten Hag’s preferred system Reportedly, Ten Hag is already squirrelling away for United on the condition the Red Devils don’t bother him 48 hours before Ajax play. So it would not be an unreasonable request for Rangnick to dabble with the new manager’s preferred formation in the three games that are left. Ten Hag has predominantly used 4-3-3 at Ajax while also employing a 4-2-3-1, which also happens to be Rangnick’s formation of choice. Or, rather, it is the only shape he trusts these players to stick with since they’ve proven unable or unwilling to thrive in any other setup. We have to assume Rangnick has sounded out Ten Hag on what shape he might prefer to use from the start of his reign, and while whatever answer he offers will involve new players, there is no harm in seeing how the current crop might cope in a 4-3-3. If the squad is told it is Ten Hag’s choice rather than Rangnick, it might motivate some of them to open their minds and give it their best shot, which many haven’t done for the interim manager.   4) Give Marcus Rashford a break It is hard to fathom what else United can do with Rashford to reignite the spark in the forward. He played from the start against Chelsea and looked every bit as downtrodden as he has all season. If anything, his performances and body language are getting more worrying from United’s perspective. Rangnick could keep playing Rashford and hope that his fortunes turn around in one of the three games remaining, allowing the striker to end the season on a high. But it has already reached the point where it appears United are flogging a dead horse. And it is no surprise that Rashford is knackered. Every season as a senior pro has lasted until at least mid-June, with the forward featuring in a couple of European Championships, the 2018 World Cup, the Nations League finals and other England summer internationals. Last summer seemed to take the biggest toll, with a half-fit Rashford watching much of the Euros from the bench before missing a crucial penalty in the final shoot-out. He then underwent shoulder surgery, causing him to miss the start of the season and upon returning he has never looked quite the same, either for Rangnick or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Only he and his family know what else might be affecting him away from the pitch. Many reckon United and Rashford need a break from each other, which is probably true, only not a permanent arrangement as some suggest. But there is more to be gained for both parties by sending Rashford off on holiday now. Since he has lost his spot in the England squad, he has the opportunity to take May and June to get his body and head in the best possible place for Ten Hag’s arrival.  5) End Harry Maguire’s season as well Much of the above also applies to United’s skipper, too. Rangnick says Maguire is battling to play again this season owing to a knee injury, but it is a pointless fight. His form has been so poor lately that the last thing he or United need is for the defender to return prematurely and make things even worse. Maguire is under a mega-f***-tonne of pressure and is getting very little sympathy from United fans. They were aghast at the defender being jeered on England duty, forgetting that his substitution in the Champions League was cheered by many inside Old Trafford. Maguire is not one to back down or walk away, but he needs to pick his battles. With Gareth Southgate almost certain to call him up for England’s end-of-season fixtures, Maguire could use a holiday now to clear his head and get his knee right. Maybe swerve Greece, though, big man… ",negative,chelsea

The Reds beat the Toffees in the Merseyside derby 2-0 on Sunday but Frank Lampard’s side made life difficult for their arch-rivals before Andy Robertson broke the deadlock on 62 minutes. Jurgen Klopp brought Divock Origi and Luis Diaz off the bench and the changes worked as Origi headed in the second goal from Diaz’s acrobatic effort and the Belgium international also had a hand in the opener. Here’s hoping for Everton relegation after Lampard elitism There were a few controversial moments in the game with Everton feeling they should’ve had a second-half penalty, while Sadio Mane was perhaps fortunate to stay on the pitch after poking Mason Holgate in the face. A number of comments by the Sky Sports commentary team of Martin Tyler and Jamie Carragher incensed Stubbs during the match. Stubbs tweeted: “Will have to turn this commentary off I think @Everton because it’s so biased!! “Richarlison clearly goes over on his ankle and is accused of cheating!! Liverpool class my a**e.” Will have to turn this commentary off I think @everton because it’s so biased!! Richarlison clearly goes over on his ankle and is accused of cheating!! Liverpool class my arse 🤷🏼‍♂️💙 — Alan Stubbs (@alanstubbs_6) April 24, 2022 Carragher annoyed a number of fans on social media after the former Liverpool centre-back told Richarlison to get up despite the Everton attacker rolling his ankle. “Honestly, get up. Get up, carry on,” Carragher said of Richarlison on commentary. “If [Abdoulaye] Doucoure gets a yellow card because his teammate goes down. Stupid from Doucoure trying to stop the game but Richarlison… there’s nothing wrong with him.” Stubbs appeared this morning on BBC Radio Five Live and he revealed his frustration that major decisions went against Everton. He said: “Everton had a game plan to try and frustrate Liverpool and they did that for large parts of the game. Some major decisions also went against them, for instance the penalty. The first incident isn’t but the second one (Matip on Gordon) is a clear penalty there is no doubt about that. The referee is in a great position and he bottled it. There is no other way to describe it. “Everton have been on the end of dubious VAR decisions in recent months but that is not the reason they are in the position they are in.” When asked whether Everton will stay up, Stubbs added: “I hope so. I have everything crossed. But it’s going to be close.” Stubbs also urged the players to show they have what it takes to stay in the Premier League after Burnley’s victory on Saturday plunged the Toffees into the relegation zone. Stubbs continued: “I know Frank Lampard’s record doesn’t look great but he has inherited a group of players where a lot of the damage was done before him and he had to pick up the pieces. “Could he have done more? Certainly. But ultimately it comes down to the players. They have not performed well enough this season, though there has been signs of improvement in the last three performances. “When you are down the bottom every run-in is tough. They have another tough game on Sunday at home to Chelsea. “It’s not about talk, it’s about actions. We have heard the talk all season about ‘we are too good to go down’.

The former Reds captain said:“It was the easiest way to play football for Everton. They didn’t ask the players to step up and play football, everyone was back in their own half. The only threat they had was Anthony Gordon in a race with Trent Alexander-Arnold down the left. “I’m not pooh-poohing their attitude – I’d just say it’s not that they played well. It was just about sitting in and trying to nick it. Can they do that every week? I’m not sure. “I want Everton to survive. I lived in the city for a long time.

The Dutchman will take over from Rangnick at the end of the current season with the Red Devils confirming his appointment last week. Ten Hag will have numerous issues to deal with when he takes the reins in the summer with reports all season suggesting unrest in the Man Utd dressing room.

Ronaldo scored the equaliser in a 1-1 draw against Chelsea on Thursday night to take his goal tally for the season to 23. When he was asked about Ronaldo’s future after the match, Rangnick replied: “This is something that we should speak about between Erik and the board and myself.

Rangnick said: “We have to still be fair with the players. We had quite a few other players scoring goals. “I remember, in my first 10 games, we had 10 different goalscorers. It is how many opportunities can we create and how many goalscorers. “Right now, we very much rely on Cristiano, he also showed a good performance when Chelsea were in possession.

In addition, the Premier League and FA are also discussing with the Government the sporting integrity issues raised if they do not permit fans to attend. “We are aware of the high level of frustration our supporters are facing over this issue, and we are doing everything we can to resolve it as soon as possible.” The licence has already been amended since it was first imposed, with the limit on matchday spending increased from £500,000 to £900,000, and the club have already insisted they will push to have it further amended in order for them to be able to operate as close to normal as possible. The club said they were awaiting further updates from the Government regarding the sale of further tickets for the FA Cup quarter-final tie at Middlesbrough this weekend. Meanwhile, Chelsea fans have again been urged to stop chanting Abramovich’s name. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s official spokesman said it was “completely inappropriate” to sing in support of the billionaire, who has brought unprecedented success to Chelsea since he bought the club in 2003. Downing Street said supporters should not let that blind them to Abramovich’s association to Putin, the man who ordered the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “We recognise the strength of feeling around people’s clubs, but that does not excuse behaviour which is completely inappropriate at this time,” the Prime Minister’s spokesman said. “I think people can show passion and support for their club without resorting to that sort of stuff.” The Government has said it is still “open” to Chelsea being sold but that a new application would be needed to enable a sale. So far, the spokesman said, the club had not applied for a variation to its strict special licence. “We are open to the sale of the club, we would consider an application for a licence to allow that to happen in the right circumstances,” the spokesman said. “But it is for Chelsea to determine the exact process. My understanding is potential buyers would approach the club, who would then need to apply for a further amended licence to facilitate the sale. “As far as I’m aware that hasn’t happened at this point.” ",positive,chelsea

Ronaldo has scored 23 goals in 36 appearances in all competitions this campaign after joining from Serie A side Juventus in the summer transfer window. There have been rumours over the last few months that the Portugal international could ask to leave at the end of the season if Man Utd fail to qualify for the Champions League. Manchester United scout watches £100m target subbed at HT; Everton’s Richarlison hope It would take a minor miracle for the Red Devils to finish fourth this season and, with questions over whether Ten Hag will want to keep Ronaldo next term, the striker’s future is up in the air. When asked if Ronaldo would fit into Ten Hag’s plans, Rangnick told Sky Sports: “This is a question you need to askErik ten Hag. “He’s showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it’s obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, it’s pretty obvious.” CR7 in front of the Stretford End 🎯 👏 @Cristiano #MUFC | #MUNCHE pic.twitter.com/Qrnd0G1hKx — Manchester United (@ManUtd) April 28, 2022 On summer recruitment, he added: “If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window. “They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks. “This shows it is possible that this can happen and it would not necessarily need three, four years in order to do that.” On the appointment of Ten Hag, Rangnick continued: “Knowing Erik will be the manager, with a good recruitment process and bringing in the right players, I’m very positive the supporters and the media will be able to see a better team and, at the end, hopefully a better position in the league. “There are quite a few good examples in the league with when Jurgen Klopp came to Liverpool, Pep Guardiola to Manchester City, Thomas Tuchel came to Chelsea – yes, he came in the middle of the season and inherited a top-quality squad, but you still need to win the Champions League. “If you know what you’re looking for, the profiles of the different positions you need, it shouldn’t hopefully take too long.”  ",positive,chelsea

Holding has suggested that Arsenal “looked more like a team” after being told off by Arteta: “Yeah, we were a bit disappointed to concede that coming in just before half-time,” Holding told Arsenal Media. “It would have been nice to go in one-nil, but he gave us all a shouting and telling off and we came out and looked more like a team and played how he wanted to play.” On fans calling for him to be brought on off the bench in previous weeks, he added:“Yeah, the fans were calling to bring Rob Holding on, but he was already on! “It’s what it’s been like, Ben and Gabi have been great all year and when I’ve had to come on and try and help us secure the three points it’s vital for us, so to play the full 90 and get the three points is even better.” Elsewhere, Chris Sutton has criticised Arsenal for “celebrating like they’ve won the league” after their 2-1 victory over West Ham on Sunday. There were dramatic scenes in the away end for both goals and at full time as they celebrated a tight win at the London Stadium but Sutton didn’t like what he saw. “Arsenal celebrating like they’ve won the league… dear me.” ",positive,chelsea

He believes this will be a “hard game” for the hosts: “Manchester United have more immediate concerns, however, and this’ll be a hard game for them,” Merson told Sportskeeda. “The way Brentford have been playing, they could pull this off.

I think they’ve got tough games,” O’Hara told talkSPORT. “I think [Tottenham] have got one more tough game, and then it’s the North London Derby.

The Lazio standout has been linked with a move to the Red Devils. They are understood to value him at€70m. Manchester United scout watches £100m target subbed at HT; Everton’s Richarlison hope The Serbia international has been with Lazio since 2017. He has consistently been their top performer both domestically and in Europe. The 27-year-old has played 291 times for the Serie A club. He has been capped 30 times by Serbia since making his debut in 2017. Former Chelsea player Mateja Kezman is Milinkovic-Savic’s agent. Foot01 have quoted him saying that they are ‘dealing with Manchester United and PSG’. It is also noted that the player ‘wants to go’ to United. Kezman has now suggested that these quotes were fabricated and that it is “fake news”: “It’s fake news. I have never given interviews in the last period, some journalists are really incredible,” Kezman said (quotes via MEN). “I’m very angry, it is a lack of respect towards me, towards Sergej and Lazio.” Elsewhere, Tony Cascarino has insisted that he “can see why Erik ten Hag may fancy” signing James Ward-Prowse when he arrives at Man Utd at the end of the season. Southampton midfielder Ward-Prowse, who has ten goals and seven assists in all competitions this season, is one player who has been linked with a move to Man Utd this week and former Chelsea striker Cascarino thinks he would be a good signing. “It was interesting to see James Ward-Prowse linked with a move to Manchester United,” Cascarino told The Times. “At 27, the Southampton midfielder is entering the peak years of his career and if he is not content with being a one-club man, now may be the time for a big move. “Ward-Prowse is so much more than simply a dead-ball expert (though there are few better than him from corners and free kicks).

The Red Devils suffered another blow to their chances of qualifying for the Champions League next season after they lost 1-0 to out-of-form Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday. Defeat against the Toffees means Man Utd are now six points behind fourth-placed Tottenham in the Premier League table with seven matches to go. ‘Laughable’ Liverpool exposed; Man Utd must shift quartet out To make matters worse, their last seven games of the season look extremely tricky to navigate, with Liverpool, Arsenal, Brighton and Crystal Palace to play away and Norwich, Brentford and Chelsea to face at Old Trafford. After watching Man City and Liverpool put on an amazing spectacle on Sunday, Neville tore into Man Utd after the weekend’s results. “I’ve got very few words left for Manchester United,” Neville said on his Sky Sports podcast. “No anger, no comment anymore. They are a bit of a farce; you almost expect it from them. The players are taking Ralf Rangnick down with them. They are bad. “When I look at Manchester City and Liverpool, they have humble football players; no over-inflated egos, they understand their position, the team comes first. “There isn’t one Manchester United player that would get into any of those two teams, so why would you have an over-inflated ego, think you didn’t have to work hard, or be spiritless? I don’t see anything anymore.” And Neville now thinks Rangnick’s reputation is now taking a hit with the Man Utd interim boss looking ‘weaker and vulnerable on the touchline’ in recent weeks. Neville added: “Ralf Rangnick came with an incredible reputation but he’s now starting to be wounded by what’s happening around him and he looks weaker and vulnerable on the touchline due to the performances of players on the pitch, who have nothing to do with him. “Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is a good man, the players liked him and yet they turned him over. It’s a real difficult position for the club to be at. “I feel like most Manchester United fans at this moment in time in that I don’t know where to turn next or what’s going to happen. “I’m living on the feeling that the club one day will return. The club will rise again but this is getting low, real low. But it will come back, and you look forward to that day. “Those Liverpool fans over my shoulder have been where Manchester United have been, they have been in those low moments when Manchester United were winning, when they maybe didn’t have a team they could be proud of. Maybe it’s time for those Manchester United players to have a look at themselves. “I do believe players want to do well, but what they are showing at this moment in time is nowhere near good enough.”  ",positive,chelsea
https://www.goal.com/en/news/gerard-moreno-villarreal-klopp-fearing-champions-league/bltd921e1e30cc76f98,Gerard Moreno: Why Villarreal’s leading light has Klopp fearing an unlikely Champions League comeback,"Villarreal may have been comprehensively outperformed by Liverpool in their Champions League semi-final first leg, but excitement in the tiny Spanish city remains high ahead of the return fixture. Part of the reason for that, as well as for some optimism, is that Gerard Moreno may well be back on Tuesday. The forward missed the 2-0 defeat at Anfield last week with a hamstring problem, but may force the issue to appear against the Reds at La Ceramica. He is the man Jurgen Klopp highlighted as the potential danger for the second leg, and the Reds' coach was no doubt pleased to see that the Spain forward did not make the first game. “It is not over, for the second game Gerard Moreno is back,” Klopp told reporters post-match on Merseyside. “It’s half-time, no more, no less. ""How much work is left to do? The full work. Nothing has happened yet.” Without Moreno in the first leg, Villarreal’s plan did not work. They wanted to sit deep and shut down their opponents, to take a 0-0 draw or potentially more back to Spain. However, with Moreno absent, the ball did not stick upfront when they tried to clear it. The 30-year-old has a velvet touch that would have given his side some relief from Liverpool’s asphyxiating press. Pervis Estupinan’s own goal and Sadio Mane’s strike, in the space of two second-half minutes, helped Liverpool to a comfortable home victory. It was one which lured TalkSport broadcaster and former Chelsea player Jason Cundy into a broadside aimed at the Yellow Submarine, whom he accused of playing a “disgraceful” game. ""I don't know what I've just watched, but Villarreal are a disgrace,” he sneered. “That is a disgrace. UEFA must be watching that and thinking, 'We are in big trouble'. “If that's what's getting to the semi-final and facing English teams... Liverpool did not get out of second gear. It was shocking. Disgraceful. Liverpool are brilliant, but that was a disgrace to the Champions League.” Words which did not go unnoticed in Spain, with Villarreal determined to make Cundy eat them on Tuesday night. To do that, Moreno is vital. Born in Catalunya, the striker came through Villarreal’s youth teams and eventually made his first-team debut for the club in the 2014-15 campaign. The following season, he signed for Espanyol and spent three solid, if unspectacular seasons there. Villarreal brought him back in for €20 million (£17.5m/$23.5m) and he began to show his quality on a regular basis. In the 2019-20 season, he netted 18 La Liga goals in 35 appearances, before scoring 23 in 33 the following year, along with seven goals in Europe to help take the Yellow Submarine to Europa League glory. Netting against Chelsea in the European Super Cup in August, he overtook Giuseppe Rossi to become Villarreal’s all-time top scorer, and currently has 95 goals for the club. Having made his international debut in 2019, he also helped Spain reach the Euro 2020 semi-finals last summer, and if his injury problems subside, should make Luis Enrique’s 2022 World Cup roster. Despite the immense quality he possesses, both to score and create goals, but also on the ball as a dribbler, Moreno has a low profile outside of Spain, without much hype or fanfare. That could change if he becomes the wrecking ball to Liverpool’s quadruple hopes, though. Juventus and Bayern Munich have, after all, already experienced how devastating Villarreal and Moreno can be. After a 1-1 first-leg draw in Spain, the second leg against Juve was a tense 0-0 heading into the final 15 minutes. Enter Moreno. In the 78th minute he broke the deadlock from the penalty spot, with Pau Torres and Arnaut Danjuma adding further goals as Villarreal surged past the Italians. Moreno then impressed as his side beat Bayern 1-0 at home, and then set up Samu Chukwueze’s late goal at the Allianz Arena to send Villarreal through, against the odds. His absence at Anfield was a blow, although Villarreal coach Unai Emery is hopeful his team can turn the tables on Liverpool at home. “In the semi-finals, the surprise factor that we could have had in the last 16 and quarter-finals had diluted,” admitted Emery after the first leg. “Today was a question of resisting defensively to have a chance (at home) and we did it in some ways because there it will be different, and there we will get more out of it. “We know that we can compete with Liverpool but today we did not do it. In La Ceramica, we will try and make it so the game is completely different.” Moreno has 13 goals and six assists this season, down from the high standards established in previous years, but he has only made 26 appearances because of injury. When he does play, something happens. Moreno has formed a dynamic and exciting partnership with Danjuma, who often profits from clever interplay with the Spaniard. And with their talisman returning, Villarreal still believe they have a chance. “If there’s one good thing this team has it’s that it believes, and it believes the second leg will be different,” said goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli. “We have all the confidence in the world, if not we’d let them go through to the final right now. ""Tuesday will be a totally different game, I have no doubts this team will show up.” If Moreno does, and is in good enough condition, then Villarreal will too.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/lukaku-sold-summer-chelsea-nightmare-no-sign-ending/bltc6088ba258162b62,No way back: Lukaku must be sold this summer as Chelsea nightmare shows no sign of ending,"In the moments after Thomas Tuchel had made his final substitutions of the afternoon at Goodison Park, the broadcasters picked out Romelu Lukaku sitting on the Chelsea bench. Motionless and expressionless, the Belgium international could only watch on, knowing he would not be involved against his former club, Everton. Though Chelsea found themselves 1-0 down against the relegation-threatened Toffees after Richarlison had opened the scoring early in the second half, Tuchel decided against calling upon his £100 million ($136m) club-record signing in his pursuit of an equaliser. Instead he threw on Christian Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech, the wide forwards joining fellow substitute Mateo Kovacic on the pitch after the midfielder replaced Jorginho at half time. Neither Pulisic or Ziyech could muster much in their 30 minutes on the pitch, however, as Chelsea slipped to a third defeat in their last six Premier League matches. pic.twitter.com/A7qdaI0OBU ""We had to take Jorgi off and I only had three changes,"" was Tuchel's short explanation of leaving Lukaku in reserve when speaking to reporters post-match, though such an excuse would hardly have been believable at the start of season. After triumphantly leading Inter to the Scudetto in 2021, the reigning Serie A Player of the Year was expected to be a difference-maker for a Chelsea side when they faced deep, low blocks, as they did on Sunday. Instead, he is nothing more than a bit-part player at Stamford Bridge. Of Lukaku's last nine appearances, only one has come from the start, while he is yet to score a league goal in 2022. The last time he completed 90 minutes came all the way back in February, in the infamous game against Crystal Palace that saw him break the record for the fewest touches recorded by an outfield player in a Premier League game (seven) since Opta records began. Kai Havertz replaced him in the line up following that game at Selhurst Park, and scored eight in 12 games to justify his selection, but the Germany international has gone off the boil of late, failing to score in his last six. He was clearly rattled against Everton by Yerry Mina's attempts to wind him up, and throwing on the more experienced and physically imposing Lukaku might have been the way for Tuchel to go. But instead he kept his tracksuit on, the £325,000 wage he earned over the past seven days done so solely in training sessions. That is not a sustainable place for Chelsea to be in, particularly given their ownership situation, and their relationship with Lukaku is one they need to get out of sooner rather than later. A parting of ways this summer would be the best for all parties, too, with GOAL having learned that the player is unhappy with his lack of game time under Tuchel and is exploring other options. A return to Inter has been touted in many quarters as his preferred option in Serie A. Lukaku's preference, however, would be to remain at Chelsea and make his second spell at the club more successful than his first, but he ultimately wants the support from the coaching staff to allow him to flourish. That seems unlikely to be forthcoming while Tuchel remains in charge, though, with the German coach unwilling to adapt his style of football to incorporate Lukaku. Selling Lukaku so soon after he returned to the club would be a bitter pill for Chelsea to swallow, and they would only receive a fraction of what they paid for the 28-year-old if they were to sell this summer. But with the situation unlikely to change in Chelsea's final five games of the season, the time has come for a difficult decision to be made. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Net worth, Chelsea bid & which sports teams he owns","Several candidates emerged as potential new owners at Chelsea once Roman Abramovich announced that he would be selling the club, but Todd Boehly appears set to inherit the reins at Stamford Bridge as a consortium he heads up become the preferred bidders at Stamford Bridge. A new era for the Blues is being ushered in, with a Russian billionaire that has been at the helm since 2003 preparing to walk away after seeing his assets frozen by the UK government. Change has not been quick to implement in west London, with a protracted takeover saga seeing a number of interested parties enter the fray, but Boehly has emerged as a leading contender to take ownership of the Premier League heavyweights – which begs the question: Who is he? GOAL takes a look... Boehly is an American businessman, philanthropist and investor who went to school in Bethesda, Maryland before moving to England to study at the London School of Economics. From there he spent time working at Citibank and CS First in Boston before moving on to Guggenheim Partners in 2001. He launched that firm’s credit investing business and would go on to become president of the company. In 2013 he fronted a deal between Time Warner Cable and the Los Angeles Dodgers to create SportsNet LA – a network that broadcasts all things related to the baseball franchise. Two years later, in 2015, Boehly pooled some of the assets he collected at Guggenheim – including The Hollywood Reporters, Dick Clark Productions and Security Benefit – to found Eldridge Industries, a holding company that owns stakes in roughly 80 finance, media, sports, real estate and technology businesses. A Todd Boehly-led consortium is the preferred bidder to take over Chelsea, subject to approval from both the Premier League and the United Kingdom government 🔵 pic.twitter.com/js0XF0qWhJ The 46-year-old is, according to Forbes, worth around £3.6 billion ($4.5bn). He previously made a play for Chelsea back in 2019, with an offer in the region of £2.2bn ($2.8bn) being knocked back. Boehly is the co-owner of seven-time MLB World Series winners the Los Angeles Dodgers – who last captured the grandest prize in baseball back in 2020. He also owns stakes in 17-time NBA champions the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Sparks women’s basketball team. His latest bid for power at Stamford Bridge has seen Boehly team up with fellow Dodgers co-owner Mark Walters, British businessman Jonathan Goldstein, Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and US investment firm Clearlake Capital – with that consortium boasting some serious spending power between them.

Blues supporters will be eager to see a long-running saga, which has presented plenty of challenges on and off the field, brought to a close as soon as possible, while they will also be pleased to hear that a potential new owner has ambitious plans for his various sporting ventures. Boehly said while speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference in LA: “There’s nothing like sports to excite passion. And if you have passion, then you have people who care about things. “And if you have people who care about things, you have great opportunity. And really, it’s about curating that experience, that access, that opportunity. “For example, we’ll have four million people coming out to Dodger Stadium this year. So, our goal is to give them the best possible experience. We still have the most affordable tickets in the league basically, for a stadium that’s full regularly. “In some sports like the NFL, they share all the media money. In baseball, you’re really a derivative of your local market. “The Premier League’s similar. If you look at the way it works, to be one of the big brands, you have a structural advantage. And for us, we’re always looking for structural advantages.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

He missed the 2-1 defeat against Brighton & Hove Albion at the Emirates Stadium, the 1-0 away defeat against Southampton, the 4-2 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, the 3-1 victory against Manchester United at home, and the 2-1 away win against West Ham United.  In his absence, Arsenal have relied on Egypt international Mohamed Elneny, who has started in the last three matches where the Gunners have registered wins. While Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has ruled out the player for the rest of the season, it seems Partey is not giving up yet.  On Monday, Arsenal’s official Twitter handle posted a video of defender Gabriel Magalhaes diving to head home a cross from Gabriel Martinelli for the winning goal against West Ham at London Stadium and Partey responded. 🇧🇷 Gabi x Gabi 🇧🇷#WHUARS pic.twitter.com/pq690RT5Cn “Tom X Tom [Takehiro Tomiyasu] soon.”  His statement was also in response to defender Takehiro Tomiyasu, who returned from injury in the game against West Ham, and an indication he will play with him before the season ends.  Ahead of Arsenal’s trip to face West Ham, Arteta admitted the absence of Partey was affecting his plans for the team.  “The stats are there and they are unquestionable,” Arteta told Daily Mail. “The win rate when Thomas is there is higher. It is something that is not good for us because in the last two seasons he has not been there as much as we want.  “We need him to play in that role on his own, with the quality he brings and the experience that he brings. And the fact he brings things that are unique that we want.  “Then we can accommodate players in other positions that for them are more relevant and can determine games in the way that we can. “Otherwise we have to consider and improve with the players we have by using them in a different way, changing formation, and finding ways to compensate.”  Arsenal, who are sitting fourth on the 20-team table with 63 points from 34 matches, will face Leeds United at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-world-cup-2022-squad-which-players-gareth-southgate/blt0d5100e0d523d4ce,England World Cup 2022 squad: Which players will get the nod from Gareth Southgate & make the plane to Qatar?,"The countdown to the 2022 World Cup is well and truly on, with 23 seats on the plane to Qatar up for grabs as Gareth Southgate pieces together his plans for another shot at global glory with England. The Three Lions reached the semi-finals in Russia four years ago, only to come up short against Croatia, and reached a final at Wembley Stadium in Euro 2020 before suffering more penalty shootout heartache against Italy. Positive steps are being taken in the right direction, but can a 56-year wait for tangible success be brought to a close in the Middle East and who will be charged with the task of landing major silverware? GOAL takes a look at the hopefuls longing to see their names called. Jordan Pickford.That's all. pic.twitter.com/BKSqEuwXWg Everton keeper Jordan Pickford has been Southgate’s go-to option between the sticks, as he blends shot-stopping ability with impressive distribution off the deck, and appears guaranteed to make the cut if fit. The same could be said for Aaron Ramsdale following his eye-catching campaign at Arsenal, with the 23-year-old another of those that is as comfortable with his feet as he is with his hands. Burnley’s Nick Pope has often been third in line for England and will hope to see that trend continue when some big calls are made ahead of a showpiece event in November. Sam Johnstone is playing Championship football at West Brom this season, but remains in contention, while Jack Butland could surge up the pecking order if a starting berth is retained at Crystal Palace. Etienne Green has been making quite a name for himself at Saint-Etienne in France but he, along with fellow England U21 international Josef Bursik of Stoke, remains one for the future. Alex McCarthy and Fraser Forster have been in and around senior squads before, but would need untimely setbacks to be endured by others in order to see a path clear for them. Player Selection odds Jordan Pickford 1/12 Aaron Ramsdale 1/10 Nick Pope 4/9 Sam Johnstone 2/1 Jack Butland 5/1 Etienne Green 20/1 Alex McCarthy 25/1 Freddie Woodman 28/1 Fraser Forster 33/1 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗼𝗻𝗲. 𝗕𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗵 𝗼𝗻𝗲. 𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗹 𝗼𝗻𝗲.England right-back edition 💫 pic.twitter.com/nAwhrBkm8H There are a number of spots in Southgate’s defensive unit that appear to have been filled, with eight players currently odds-on to make England’s final 23-man party. Harry Maguire of Manchester United, Manchester City centre-half John Stones, United and Chelsea left-backs Luke Shaw and Ben Chilwell and the versatile Ben White of Arsenal are all expected to get the nod. There is far greater competition at right-back, with Kyle Walker of Manchester City, Liverpool star Trent Alexander-Arnold, Chelsea full-back Reece James and Newcastle new boy Kieran Trippier all competing for one starting berth. Outside of the established elite, Tyrone Mings’ value as a left-footed centre-half could see the Aston Villa man called upon. Conor Coady of Wolves, AC Milan centre-half Fikayo Tomori and Eric Dier and Joe Gomez of Tottenham and Liverpool respectively could figure if fortune favours them. Tariq Lamptey has caught the eye at Brighton, but faces fierce competition in his favoured defensive berth. Recognition may well come for the likes of Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi or Chelsea's Trevoh Chalobah as they continue their development. Player Selection odds Harry Maguire 1/20 John Stones 1/20 Ben Chilwell 1/16 Luke Shaw 1/12 Kyle Walker 1/8 Ben White 1/3 Trent Alexander-Arnold 1/3 Reece James 4/11 Kieran Trippier 7/4 Tyrone Mings 2/1 Conor Coady 2/1 Fikayo Tomori 3/1 Eric Dier 7/2 Joe Gomez 7/2 Marc Guehi 7/2 Trevoh Chalobah 7/2 Tariq Lamptey 4/1 Well… About time 😅 an absolute dream to score my first England goal 🦁 well done boys! Great performance! ❤️ pic.twitter.com/Ea10Hb4P9H There are another eight apparently obvious selections when it comes to midfield berths, with West Ham holding star Declan Rice, talented teenager Jude Bellingham of Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea playmaker Mason Mount and Manchester City youngster Phil Foden the shortest-priced of those. Jack Grealish, as the most expensive player in British football at Manchester City, is another almost guaranteed to secure a ticket, along with Bukayo Saka of Arsenal and Leeds United talisman Kalvin Phillips. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson will hope to have done enough to earn a call from Southgate, while Arsenal starlet Emile Smith Rowe has emerged as another useful creative influence. Conor Gallagher’s impressive loan spell at Crystal Palace has brought him into contention, while Jesse Lingard cannot be ruled out entirely despite struggling for minutes at Manchester United as he will drop into the free agent pool this summer and land himself a move elsewhere. James Maddison may be a key man at Leicester, but other playmakers are ahead of him on England’s depth chart, while the same can be said for Liverpool midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain – a man with 35 caps to his name. Dele Alli will need to produce something special during a loan spell at relegation-threatened Everton to work his way back into favour, while home-grown Chelsea star Ruben Loftus-Cheek is another to have fallen out of favour since figuring in England’s run to the last four at the 2018 World Cup. Player Selection odds Declan Rice 1/20 Jude Bellingham 1/20 Mason Mount 1/20 Phil Foden 1/20 Jack Grealish 1/16 Bukayo Saka 1/10 Jordan Henderson 1/3 Kalvin Phillips 1/3 Emile Smith Rowe Evens Conor Gallagher 7/4 James Ward-Prowse 11/4 Jesse Lingard 11/4 Curtis Jones 4/1 Harvey Barnes 4/1 Harvey Elliott 4/1 James Maddison 4/1 Oliver Skipp 4/1 Ruben Loftus-Cheek 5/1 Dele Alli 6/1 Jacob Ramsey 6/1 Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 10/1 ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️Harry Kane is now @England's joint-highest goalscorer in major tournaments (EUROs, #WorldCup), alongside @GaryLineker on 10 goals pic.twitter.com/8uyw6EBXbY Given that he is captain of the Three Lions and a man well on course to chase down Wayne Rooney’s all-time record goal haul for his country, it may come as a surprise to find that Tottenham striker Harry Kane is not top of the market when it comes to attacking calls. He will be involved, though, if untimely injuries are avoided, as will Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling and Manchester United star Marcus Rashford. Jadon Sancho has come back into form at Manchester United, giving him a shot at selection, while Dominic Calvert-Lewin will be hoping to do enough at Everton to prove that he can provide capable cover for Kane. Manchester United's Marcus Rashford remains highly regarded and is expected to make the plane, but his odds of inclusion may take a tumble if the dip in form, which saw him left out of England's March international panel, continues. Jarrod Bowen’s fine form at West Ham has made him flavour of the month, but he will need to maintain his current standards in order to secure a ticket to Qatar. Tammy Abraham has fared admirably in Italy with Roma, while Ollie Watkins remains a handful at Aston Villa, and they could be asked to provide back-up in a No.9 post. Callum Hudson-Odoi needs to be figuring more frequently for Chelsea in order to put himself into contention, Patrick Bamford and Callum Wilson have to shake off injury struggles at Leeds and Newcastle respectively, and Danny Ings must raise his game with Aston Villa in order to add to his three caps. There is little chance of Leicester’s Jamie Vardy being asked to step out of international retirement, but an attacking star may burst onto the scene out of nowhere and stage a late surge for selection within Southgate’s goalscoring ranks.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-quadruple-bid-perfect-start-carabao-cup-victory/blt0235b084005b3574,"One down, three to go? Liverpool's quadruple bid off to perfect start with epic Carabao Cup victory","Match statistics: Chelsea 0-0 Liverpool (10-11 pens.) The day began with tears for the injured Thiago Alcantara, but there were only smiles at the end for Liverpool. The Carabao Cup trophy used to be a permanent fixture at Anfield, and it is back in the Reds’ possession once more. The first leg of a potential quadruple is in the bag, for Jurgen Klopp and his team. They and their fans went through hell to get there, mind. This will go down as one of the most incredible football matches - never mind finals - in living memory. Where do you even begin to unravel what we witnessed here today at Wembley? It took 120 minutes and 22 penalties to settle it. But when Kepa Arrizabalaga, the Chelsea goalkeeper, sent his spot-kick into orbit at around 7.20pm, Liverpool could finally celebrate. And boy did they. SCENES!!! 🤯Kepa Arrizabalaga misses the 22nd penalty after being subbed on for the shoot-out! 😨 pic.twitter.com/yLIOIQWdUD KEPA MISSED IT 🤯LIVERPOOL ARE CHAMPIONS 🏆 pic.twitter.com/zCcEccrgnQ Kepa had been brought specifically for the shootout, his job to save penalties rather than take them. But the Spain international, a specialist, could do nothing as, one by one, Liverpool’s stars held their nerve from 12 yards. Caoimhin Kelleher was the 11th Red to do so, burying his penalty with aplomb. What a day this was for the Irishman, the deputy for Alisson Becker who did not put a foot, or a hand, wrong throughout. Kepa’s miss sparked wild scenes. Red smoke filled the north London air as the pyrotechnics were unleashed. Klopp, his staff and his players sprinted to Kelleher, who celebrated in front of the Liverpool supporters as the Wembley DJ played ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’. Who says the Carabao Cup doesn’t matter, eh? There was nothing to separate the sides in the two league meetings earlier this year, and this was just as tight a contest, if not tighter. At times, it bordered on farcical. Chelsea had three goals disallowed and Liverpool one. VAR played its part, and so did the two goalkeepers. Kelleher made big saves from Christian Pulisic and Romelu Lukaku, while Edouard Mendy made an incredible one to deny Sadio Mane. The Senegal star was the Man Of The Match by a mile, and he was not even there for the conclusion. Chance after chance came and went. Mo Salah clean through, denied on the line by Thiago Silva. Mason Mount hit the post and missed another good opportunity. Mendy denied Virgil van Dijk and Luis Diaz. It was relentless, breathless, almost dangerously intense. Lord only knows what Klopp and Thomas Tuchel went through on the touchline. They embraced during the first half, and shared a nice moment when Kepa blazed his penalty over, but their heart-rate cannot have dropped below 130bpm here. And so Liverpool have ‘their’ trophy back. This is the ninth time they have lifted the League Cup, and only two of those have been settled in 90 minutes. They really are the marathon men in this competition, aren’t they? There is still plenty of running to do this season, mind. They enjoyed themselves here, but they know that there could be so much more to come. Manchester City are in their sights in the Premier League, and they will fancy their chances of going deep in both the Champions League and the FA Cup, too. That is for tomorrow, though. Today, it is time to celebrate. Klopp did. He danced a jig to Dua Lipa in front of his adoring fans. Kelleher could barely contain himself, Harvey Elliott grabbed a flare, the passion written all over his teenage face. James Milner, the oldest member of the squad, smiled like it was his first time. Joel Matip grinned and bounced, Van Dijk waved a corner flag around. It was carnage. A fitting climax, you could say. Liverpool Football Club are doing what they do. They are gathering cups again. One suspects there will be more to come this season, as well. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-is-man-utd-worst-premier-league-finish/blt231ba825e43c9bd6,What is Man Utd's worst Premier League finish?,"Manchester United’s struggles since Sir Alex Ferguson headed into retirement have been well documented, with a team that collected 13 Premier League titles under a legendary Scottish coach enduring serious regression since he stepped away from the dugout in 2013. David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have all failed to rekindle former glories, while Ralf Rangnick is now preparing to pass a managerial baton to Erik ten Hag in the summer of 2022. Champions League football is unlikely to be agenda for the incoming Dutch coach, with another backwards step being taken on the field at Old Trafford, but are the Red Devils heading towards their worst finish in the modern era? GOAL takes a look… Manchester United's worst Premier League campaign came in 2013-14 – in the immediate aftermath of Ferguson’s departure. The Red Devils finished that season, which saw Moyes dismissed in the April after just 10 months at the helm, in seventh spot and with just 64 points to their name. They suffered 12 defeats through 38 games – another unwanted record in the Premier League era – and collected 19 wins. Rank Season Points Position 1 2013-14 64 7th =2 2015-16 66 5th =2 2018-19 66 6th =2 2019-20 66 3rd United would finish inside the top four just once across the following three seasons, with point tallies in the 60s becoming an alarmingly common theme. Since that rather disastrous showing under Moyes, with Ryan Giggs taking charge on an interim basis in the wake of his departure, the Red Devils have finished with 66 points on three occasions. David Moyes' six-year contract at Manchester United would have ended today... 📝The worst Premier League appointment ever?! 🤦‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/pXSIA0ysXr That return was only good enough for a fifth-placed standing under Van Gaal in 2015-16, although he did deliver FA Cup glory, while a further step backwards into sixth was taken in 2018-19 as Mourinho stumbled out of the blocks and Solskjaer wobbled on the back of an initial honeymoon period. Champions League qualification was secured with 66 points in 2019-20, as a Norwegian Treble winner saw his side into third spot, and United can do no better than hit that mark again in the present. With four games remaining in their 2021-22 campaign – against Chelsea, Brentford, Brighton and Crystal Palace – Rangnick’s men sit sixth on 54 points with 12 left to play for, meaning that they may yet post a new club-record low. Rank Season Points Position 1 1993-94 92 1st 2 1999-00 91 1st 3 2008-09 90 1st =4 2006-07 89 1st =4 2011-12 89 2nd =4 2012-13 89 1st While United have found the going tough of late, they have plenty of happy memories to fall back on. Their best showing to date came in the second year of the Premier League in 1993-94, with back-to-back title triumphs wrapped up as an Eric Cantona-inspired side collected 92 points while also going on to lift the FA Cup as part of a memorable double. A year on from going one better in completing a historic Treble, the Red Devils cemented their standing as top dogs in English football by accumulating 91 points in 1999-2000, with a club-record 28 victories collected along the way while also suffering just three defeats and plundering 97 goals. Ferguson’s men broke back into the 90s a decade later, in 2008-09, and saw their defence breached just 24 times that season as they also savoured League Cup glory. Three other campaigns, including Ferguson’s farewell tour, delivered 89-point hauls, with a final tally of 75 – on two occasions – as low as an all-time coaching great sunk in the wake of a rebranding of the English top-flight in 1992.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/watch-garnacho-man-utd-senior-debut-stunning-chipped-goal/blte26996407aacd48b,Watch: Garnacho follows up Man Utd senior debut with stunning chipped goal in U23s clash with Liverpool,"Alejandro Garnacho continues to show why he is held in such high regard by Manchester United, with the 17-year-old following up a senior debut for the Red Devils with an impressive chipped goal for the club’s U23 side in a meeting with Liverpool. The talented teenager, who has already broken into the full Argentina squad, made his Premier League bow off the bench in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Old Trafford – as he came on to partner Cristiano Ronaldo in attack during the close stages of that game. His intention is to see many more minutes over the coming years, as Erik ten Hag prepares to inherit first-team reins from Ralf Rangnick, but for now his focus is locked on catching the eye at youth level – with a prominent role played for United’s U18 side this season in their run to the FA Youth Cup final. Having stepped back down from the senior fold for now, Garnacho was among the goals on Sunday during a clash with Liverpool. Alejandro Garnacho's goal against Liverpool U23s pic.twitter.com/wC1qLy7LLl He figured against the Reds as part of a side that also included Alvaro Fernandez and Hannibal Mejbri, with United continuing to see highly-rated talent drop off a fabled conveyor belt. Garnacho’s strike against Liverpool further highlighted why he is held in such high regard, as he raced through on goal to finish with aplomb. The Red Devils would go on to lose the game 3-1, but that is all part of a steep learning curve for a Madrid-born youngster that is now rubbing shoulders with Ronaldo and Lionel Messi with club and country. Garnacho is understandably delighted at enjoying a breakthrough campaign in 2021-22 and has posted on social media: “Incredible moment making my debut at 17 years old for Manchester United in the Premier League at the Theatre of Dreams. “I can’t put into words what I’m feeling right now, I’ve been dreaming of this moment since I was 4 years old. “I would like to thank everyone at the club for giving me this opportunity, my family for always being there for me, my friends and all the fans for their constant support. The hard work continues in order to have more nights like these. And remember guys, Dreams really do come true.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/lukaku-just-seven-touches-crystal-palace-chelsea-striker/blta2c2c9891a3d68d8,Lukaku records just seven touches against Crystal Palace as Chelsea striker flops again,"Romelu Lukaku was a virtual spectator in Chelsea's narrow victory over Crystal Palace on Saturday, barely featuring in the game at all and not even reaching double figures in touches. The Blues strengthened their hold on third place with a 1-0 win at Selhurst Park, thanks to Hakim Ziyech's 89th minute strike. But Lukaku once more failed to impress, or indeed even make himself noticed out on the pitch in south London. The ex-Inter man recorded the first touch of the afternoon on Saturday, kicking off for Chelsea to get proceedings underway. 2 - Romelu Lukaku had just two touches of the ball in the first half against Crystal Palace, with one of those being the first pass of the game from kick-off. Ghosted. pic.twitter.com/lS4zCe3FQp But that was about all Chelsea fans saw of him in a dire opening 45 minutes for the Belgian, who mustered just one more touch before the half-time whistle blew. The second half was hardly any better and he finished the match having had contact with the ball on just seven occasions, one of which was that kick-off - fewer than any Premier League player since Opta data started being recorded (2003-04). 7 - Romelu Lukaku had just seven touches against Crystal Palace, the fewest in a single Premier League game for a player with 90+ minutes played since this data is available in full for the competition (2003-04). One of those touches was from kick-off in the first half. Quiet. Lukaku returned to Stamford Bridge to great fanfare over the summer, having proved crucial in Inter's successful bid to reclaim the Serie A title from Juventus for the first time in 10 years. But his second spell at Chelsea has so far fallen well short of expectations following his reported club record £97.5 million move. The Belgian managed 24 Serie A goals last term but has netted just five times in 17 Premier League games this time round, while he also provoked the wrath of the Chelsea support with an explosive Sky Sport Italia interview in December in which he admitted misgivings over manager Thomas Tuchel's methods and that he had never wanted to leave Inter in the first place. Questioned over Lukaku's dismal display on Saturday, Tuchel told reporters: ""I'm not so sure if I have a good answer. I don't know what it says. ""It says he was obviously not involved and could not make a point today. I am not sure if it says so much about us in general."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/rice-warned-off-pointless-man-utd-transfer-by-ex-west-ham/blte8ce7f2a81de3247,Rice warned off 'pointless' Man Utd transfer by ex-West Ham man Ferdinand,"Declan Rice has been warned off a ""pointless"" potential transfer to Manchester United by ex-West Ham defender Anton Ferdinand, who says he should only leave if a club that is ""challenging for the title"" comes calling. Rice has earned a reputation as one of the top midfielders in English football over the past few years, helping West Ham emerge as top-four contenders in the process. The 23-year-old's stellar performances have not gone unnoticed, with United and Chelsea both reportedly eager to bring him onto their books this summer, but Ferdinand doesn't think Old Trafford would be the best place for him to continue his development. West Ham are only two points behind sixth-placed United in the Premier League at the moment, and still have a game in hand, while they are also competing in the Europa League semi-finals. Ferdinand doesn't think the Red Devils would be much of a step up for Rice at the moment, with Erik ten Hag set to begin a rebuilding job at Old Trafford when he arrives from Ajax in the summer. ""Man Utd isn't the place to go right now. They're going through a massive transitional period,"" the former Hammers centre-half has told The Sun. ""For me personally, if I'm Rice, Man Utd is not a place that I'd be going. I'd wait a few years and see what Ten Hag does. Whether he can implement what he did at Ajax at Man Utd and get them looking more like a team that can challenge. ""Otherwise, what's the point in leaving West Ham to go somewhere you're not even challenging for a title. You're challenging to get into Europe. That's what West Ham are doing - challenging to get into the Champions League. ""We've got something to build on. He'd be in the same place at Man Utd and all it would come down to is the stature of the football club. ""As a footballer myself, I'm not going somewhere just because it's a bigger club. You've got everything at a club where you're loved and you're the main man. ""At Man Utd, you'll be one of many. Whereas, you can stay at West Ham and challenge for Europe and be the main man."" Ferdinand added: ""Me personally, I'd rather stay [than join United]. But if it was one of the teams that were fighting for the league, and they came up with the money, it would be hard for West Ham to keep him. ""Like I said, if he did go, as fans we'd appreciate what he has done for the club. He'd always be loved and classed as a legend. ""And if we got £100m-plus for him and it went back into the playing squad, then we can't grumble."" Speculation over Rice's future at West Ham is raging amid reports that he has rejected two lucrative contract extension offers, with his current deal due to expire in 2024. Moyes does not believe the midfielder will seek to move on at the end of the season, though, as he told reporters earlier this week: “I’ve said it [where I stand] and I think we have said what we think. “We like Dec and he’s got three-and-a-half years to go on his contract so I don’t think there is any big panic. “Maybe he just wants more money. People do turn down contracts. It is not unusual for players at clubs to turn down contracts, maybe it's a negotiation tactic.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/noni-madueke-psv-english-teen-star-turned-down-man-utd/k46l9p2jgeep1h1sslkxcs4pc,Noni Madueke: PSV's English teen star who turned down Man Utd,"It is no secret that an increasingnumber of young British footballers are exploring opportunities overseas in a bid to earn first-team minutes atan earlier age. Jadon Sancho has proven trailblazer in this regard, inspiring a number of teenagers to follow the Borussia Dortmund starto the Bundesliga. However, Germany's top -flight is not the only league offering youngsters a chance to progress. In Eredivisie, for example, there is a young English talent aiming to make as big an impact at PSV this season as Sancho did during his breakout campaign atDortmund in 2018-19. That player is Noni Madueke. ""[Sancho] has opened the eyes to other talents,” the 18-year-old forward, who joined PSV from Tottenham in 2018,told Voetbal International. “A year after him, I went from Spurs to PSV. The plan that I had in mind then is now workingout the way I intended it. ""In England, it is very difficult as a young talent to get into the first team, especially at the bigger clubs. The squads are very large andthere is little room for youngsters. They often stay in reserve teams for a long time orare loaned out. ""There is little flow or chance to break through. That is completely different in the Netherlands."" Having taken his first steps into the senior ranks in Eindhoven before Covid-19 brought a premature end to the 2019-20 campaign, Madueke is now set to play a key role for the Dutch giants. Before making the switch from England to continental Europe, Madueke spent the entirety of his youth football career at Tottenham, where he captained the club's Under-16s as well as making his debut for the U18s as a 15-year-old. Having been named Player of the Tournament at the prestigious Sonnenland Cup in Germany in 2017, a number of top clubs began to take notice of his potential. Manchester United made an offer to take him north, while Chelsea and Celtic were also linked with his signature. But it was PSV who won the race, with Madueke keen to ensure he earned first-team football sooner rather than later. ""There are so many young players in first teams at the top levelat PSV orAjax,” Madueke told the Daily Mailof the Eredivisie a year on from his arrival in Eindhoven. ""Players like Frenkie de Jong andall of these guys. Skip skip skip 😌 A post shared by  Noni Tristan Madueke (@nonzinoo10) on Dec 23, 2019 at 10:01am PST ""I thought if I want to get to the first team as quickly as possible, then I have to move from Tottenham and come to PSV. ""As long as I keep doing the things they are telling me, I feel like I’ll reach that first-team level sooneras opposed to if I had stayed at Tottenham."" Despite the prospect of opportunities with the senior side, Madueke has had to work his way through ranks during his two years at PSV. Upon his arrival he was introduced into the U17s squad, but after scoring three goals in as many games in December 2018 he was handed a permanent promotion to the U19s, for whom he netted a further four goals that season. In 2019-20, he took his game to new levels, scoring seven goals and providing eight assists in just 11 appearances for the U19sduring the first half of the campaign. Such returns saw him rewarded with a promotion to the Jong PSV squad, who play in the Dutch second division. In six games, he scored four goals, and by early March he was again changing lockers after officially being named as part of the first-team squad. Having made three substitute appearances earlier in the campaign, Madueke's first senior start came against Groningen on March 8, though that turned out to be PSV's final game of the season before coronavirus forced football in the Netherlands to go into hiding. The England youth international played his part in a 1-0 win, and two days later signed a new contract which will keep him at the club until 2024, despite increased interest from Arsenal, Manchester City, RB Leipzig, Valencia and Wolves since the turn of the year. Done Deal! #2024 🙌🏾 A post shared by  Noni Tristan Madueke (@nonzinoo10) on Mar 10, 2020 at 10:07am PDT Blessed with speed, skill and physicality, Madueke has spent much of his young career playing as a winger or wide forward who cuts inside from the right to either score or create goals. However, new PSV boss Roger Schmidt has arrived at Philips Stadion with a plan to play 4-4-2, meaning if Madueke is to earn more opportunities he must now adapt his game so as to become a central striker. He made the perfect start during pre-season, netting a first-half hat-trick against lower-league SC Verle that included a stunning solo strike to secure him the match ball. ""I'm not surprised. He already scored a lot of goals in training. He feels comfortable up front and doesn't have to be a winger,"" Schmidt toldDe Telegraafafter Madueke's superb display of finishing. ""Noni's timing is often very good and he has a good feeling for free space. ""I'm also very happy with his mentality. He is a good fighterand is capable of reading the situation.""  Former PSV midfielder Tommie van de Leegte is excited by what Madueke can provide in his potential new role, telling Omroep Brabant: ""He's fast and has the capability to trick his opponent. He brings creativity and is very explosive in his actions. That's what PSV needs. ""Yes, he's young, but age doesn't matter to me. He has shown himself inpre-season, so I would give him the chance to prove himself in the big games as well."" Though Madueke was not included in Schmidt's starting line-up for PSV's Eredivisie opener against Groningen on Sunday, he certainly did prove himself after coming off the bench in the second half. The teenager provided two assists to help secure a 3-1 win, and it will surely not be long before he is earning regular starts just over two years since the biggest decision his young career. “I wanted to be in the first team as young as possible, at the age of 17or 18,"" Madueke said 12 months ago. ""At a club like Tottenham that is not feasible –you only come into the picture around the age of 20. ""That is why I chose PSV two years ago and what is happeningnow with all the opportunities I get is exactly what I had in mind at the time. ""My choice has provento be the right one.""

https://www.goal.com/en/news/who-will-buy-chelsea-conor-mcgregor-nick-candy-candidates/blt2f72d34bd983be1e,"Who will buy Chelsea? Conor McGregor, Nick Candy & candidates for Abramovich to sell Blues to","Roman Abramovich may have seen his assets frozen by the UK government due to connections with Russian president Vladimir Putin, but Chelsea remain up for sale and a takeover could still go through if the right licenses and guarantees are obtained. With that in mind, a race to secure ownership of Premier League heavyweights - and the current holders of a prestigious Champions League crown - is on, with multi-billion pound bids now in the pipeline. A number of potential stakeholders at Stamford Bridge have emerged as interest builds steadily, from UFC superstars to wealthy supporters of the west London club, but who are those in the running? GOAL takes a look... An avid Chelsea supporter, billionaire property developer Candy has been talking to a group of American investors about forming a consortium to buy the Blues. His £2.5bn ($3.3bn) proposal is said to include plans for a £1.5bn ($2bn) rebuild of Stamford Bridge, while the 49-year-old – who is married to former Neighbours actress Holly Valance – has made it clear that he would look to put fellow fans at the heart of his regime. Candy has told Sky Sports of the reasons for his interest: ""I’ve supported Chelsea since the age of four. My dad was asked to play for Chelsea. I love Chelsea. ""I don’t mind where it ends up, even if it is not with me, as long as it is in safe hands."" The 86-year-old emerged as an early frontrunner after revealing long before Abramovich formally put Chelsea up for sale that he had been offered the chance to invest in the club alongside three other parties. The Swiss – who is said to be worth £4.3bn ($5.6bn) after founding American medical device business Synthes – has claimed that Abramovich will need to lower his asking price in order for a deal to go through. He has said: “Abramovich is currently asking far too much. You know, Chelsea owe him £2 billion. But Chelsea has no money. That means, those who buy Chelsea should compensate Abramovich. “As of today, we don't know the exact selling price. I can well imagine starting at Chelsea with partners. But I have to examine the general conditions first. But what I can already say, I'm definitely not doing something like this alone. If I buy Chelsea, then with a consortium consisting of six to seven investors.” The U.S. tycoon is one of those said to be interested in entering into a partnership with Wyss. The co-founder, chairman and CEO of Eldridge Industries, who has a net worth of £4.72bn ($6.1bn), had two bids for Chelsea knocked back in 2019 and is a huge sports fan after already acquiring stakes in MLB side the Los Angeles Dodgers and NBA heavyweights the LA Lakers. One of the more surprising candidates to have thrown his hat into the ring, the Irish MMA fighter saw his interest piqued once it was announced that Abramovich was looking for a buyer. He tweeted “I wish to explore this, Chelsea” when responding to WhatsApp message in which a contact said: “Chelsea for sale, £3bn. Let's buy it.” McGregor is famously a supporter of Manchester United and has previously expressed interest in wrestling control of the Red Devils from the Glazer family. He has also said that he is interested in getting involved with Scottish Premiership team Celtic. A Turkish businessman that made his £8bn ($10bn) fortune as chairman of AB Group Holding – a company which invests in tourism, cryptocurrency and construction – Bayrak is said to have met with Abramovich to discuss a possible deal. He has, however, cast doubt over whether he would be welcomed to west London, saying: “I think they don't want Turkey to buy the club. Everyone should know that the Republic of Turkey is a very big state. Very serious business people come out of this state, and we exist and will be all over the world.” GOAL has been able to confirm that Broughton has held discussions about playing a role in bids that are being prepared for Chelsea. He was previously involved in the deal that saw Fenway Sports Group bring the disastrous reign of Tom Hicks and George Gillett at Liverpool to an end in 2010. Broughton, who is a former chairman of British Airways, is negotiating with backers about tabling his own offer, although he faces a race against time to generate the funds required to enter the bidding. Another fanatical Chelsea supporter that harbours dreams of taking control of the club he loves. Reuben’s father and uncle – who form part of a £12bn ($15.6bn) business - bought a 10 per cent stake in Newcastle last year when a £300m ($391m) takeover at St James’ Park was completed, but he could head out on his own. A man that boasts the likes of Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton and Boris Johnson among his friendship group could find it difficult to get a green light from the Premier League, though, due to his family ties with top-flight rivals on Tyneside. Another of the bidders to have a redevelopment of Stamford Bridge within their grand plans for Chelsea. An approach from the Middle East is being spearheaded by Mohamed Alkhereiji, who runs Saudi Media and is CEO of the Engineer Holding Group parent company which was founded by his father Abdulelah Alkhereiji. The company turns over more than £1bn ($1.3bn) a year, while Alkhereiji is a Blues supporter and was in attendance during Abramovich’s last visit to Stamford Bridge in November 2021. Despite being a lifelong Manchester United supporter, a man with a £20bn ($26bn) fortune has been a season ticket holder at Chelsea for several years. Ratcliffe – who runs multi-national chemicals company Ineos - is the owner of French side Lille and has admitted to holding talks regarding a deal for the Blues. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: “There was some early exchange but we were a significant way apart on valuations. “The issue with Chelsea is its stadium. We are all getting older and it is a decade of your life to resolve that.” Among the others to have been linked with Chelsea are New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, while there has been talk of Moneyball mogul Billy Beane forming part of a bidding consortium. Jayed Afridi, who owns an automobile company and is CEO of consumer electrics giants Haier Pakistan, has been mooted as another potential bidder, along with Michael Rubin – the owner of sports merchandise group Fanatics, a company worth over £20bn ($26bn). Abramovich is said to have acquired Chelsea for just £140m ($182m) back in 2003, with the club enduring serious financial difficulties at that time. He has pumped considerable funding into the club over the course of a 19-year tenure and said investment has allowed 21 trophies to be secured – with that haul including five Premier League titles and two Champions League crowns. The Russian billionaire was said to have put a £3bn ($4bn) asking price on Chelsea when looking to sell, but questions have been asked of that valuation and he is no longer allowed to profit from any agreement after being sanctioned by the UK government. Anyone looking to do a deal, as the Blues work their way through a testing period off the field, must have best and final offers on the table at Stamford Bridge by Friday March 18.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/boehly-led-ownership-consortium-now-preferred-chelsea-bidder-but-/blt30c8d1ac1dfd9786,"Boehly-led consortium set to become Chelsea owners, but Jim Ratcliffe not ruled out","Chelsea have decided that a Todd Boehly-led group of investors is the preferred bidder to take over the club from owner Roman Abramovich, subject to approval from both the Premier League and the United Kingdom government. Boehly, who co-owns the Los Angeles Dodgers in the United States, is now set to become the Blues' owner with voting rights split among other investors, and he sees his bid 66 per cent backed by Clearlake Capital, a private equity firm. Still, the club, which is expected to fetch a world record-breaking fee for a sports team after a bidding war between various parties, could yet see another entity such as Jim Ratcliffe win out - though GOAL understands that's unlikely at this stage. Boehly runs 60 per cent of the $6 billion valued investment firm Eldridge Industries from which he runs most of his investments, except for the Dodgers and Los Angeles Lakers which are private investments. In 2019, Boehly had a £2.2 billion bid rejected by Abramovich for Chelsea. He followed that up with an interview in Bloomberg where he stated his interest in getting involved in Premier League football. “Football is the biggest sport in the world,” Boehly insisted. “I can’t believe American football can get to use the word ‘football’ because to me that word should be football. The fact is it is still the best product in the world. It’s 90 minutes so it has a great timeline. The passion that the fans have for the activity and the sport and the teams is unparalleled. So when you start to think about what you’re trying to build with these teams is, you’re really trying to A, win and B, be part of the community.” One of his investments is in Fortnite, the supremely popular video game. He is estimated to have a personal net worth £3.3 billion ($4.4bn). His last-minute £4.25 billion bid (which comprises a £1.75 billion investment over 10 years, plus £2.5 billion to a ""charitable trust"" likely to be related to the war in Ukraine) came as a surprise late in the process on Friday morning. It changes the landscape of the process which is run by New York investment bank Raine Group. It's unclear whether the bid will be allowed as the process has been designed to narrow down the options and it has missed several deadlines. A statement read: ""Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Chairman of INEOS, has made a formal bid for Chelsea FC, for £4.25bn. £2.5bn is committed to the Charitable Trust to support victims of the war, with £1.75bn committed to investment directly into the club over the next 10 years. ""This is a British bid, for a British club. ""We believe that a club is bigger than its owners who are temporary custodians of a great tradition. With responsibility to the fans and the community. ""That is why we are committing to spending £1.75bn over 10 years that will be for the direct benefit of the club. ""We will invest in Stamford Bridge to make it a world-class stadium, befitting of Chelsea FC. This will be organic and on-going so that we will not move away from the home of Chelsea and risk losing the support of loyal fans. ""We will continue to invest in the team to ensure we have a first class squad of the world’s greatest players, coaches and support staff, in the men’s and women’s games. ""And we hope to continue to invest in the academy to provide opportunity for talented youngsters to develop into first class players. ""We believe that London should have a club that reflects the stature of the city. One that is held in the same regard as Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich. We intend Chelsea to be that club. ""We are making this investment as fans of the beautiful game – not as a means to turn a profit. We do that with our core businesses. The club is rooted in its community and its fans. And it is our intention to invest in Chelsea FC for that reason. ""No further comment will be made from Sir Jim or INEOS during the bidding process."" The private equity firm Clearlake Capital is thought to be stumping up around 50 per cent of the bid to buy Chelsea. Alongside him is his long-term business partner Hansjorg Wyss, the Swiss billionaire who first announced that Abramovich was selling Chelsea. The Dodgers' principle owner Mark Walter is part of the group alongside British investor Jonathan Goldstein. Advising the bid are prominent Chelsea supporters Danny Finkelstein, who is a conservative member of the House of Lords, and Barbara Charone, who is a marketing executive. The Chelsea supporting former British politican George Osborne is advising the bid through his firm Robey Warshaw, with Goldman Sachs also working in an advisory role. Any prospective bidder has been asked to guarantee a minimum of £1 billion further investment over 10 years which would go towards the stadium, women's and academy teams. Along with the costs of buying the club, it would raise the overall financial commitment of the project to between £3.5 billion and £4 billion. Like the other potential options, the new Blues owners have promised investment into all areas of the club and to work on the stadium. Architects Jane Marie Smith and David Hickey, the latter who is the former project director for Abramovich’s now-cancelled 60,000-seat redevelopment, are being consulted about reviving plans for Stamford Bridge. The Premier League will conduct an owners and directors test on the group that is expected to take roughly two weeks. Once they've gained approval, the UK government will handle the money from the sale and issue an operating licence that frees up the club from the restrictions of sanctions. It will allow Chelsea to renew contracts, make signings and sell players - along with running their club shop and selling tickets to new customers for matches. It will also cut out Abramovich from the club and end a 19-year ownership period that saw the Blues win 21 trophies. The money will be frozen or given to charity with that stage yet to be fully thrashed out. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/explained-how-chelsea-affected-abramovich-sanctions/bltde22a5b972876413,Explained: How Chelsea are affected by Abramovich sanctions,"Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the United Kingdom Government, which will freeze his overseas assets, including Chelsea Football Club. On March 10, it was announced that Chelsea owner Abramovich, alongside six other high net-worth Russians, would be issued with an asset freeze and travel ban. Chelsea are now in an unprecedented period of uncertainty as the running of the club becomes directly linked to geopolitics. Chelsea can still be sold provided the sale does not benefit Abramovich or the Russian Federation, and the club are in discussions with the government about next steps. A statement from the UK government reads: ""While the current licence does not permit the sale of the club at this time, the Government is open to a sale of the club and would consider an application for a new licence to allow for a sale. ""Proceeds from any sale could not go to the sanctioned individual while he is subject to sanctions."" At least 20 buyers had been previously ready to purchase Chelsea. Chelsea can continue to play matches under a special 'Russia Regulations' licence which also allows their 1,400 staff - including players - to be paid. The upcoming Thursday evening kick-off against Norwich in the Premier League will go ahead, but only season ticket holders will be allowed to attend home games with further ticket sales barred. The Blues are not allowed to sign any new players due to the terms of their licence. It effectively places another transfer ban on the European and world champions, with the club having already endured one just three years ago. Although Chelsea are banned from making transfers, they can move money in and out of other clubs for outstanding payments related to deals done before the sanctions were imposed on March 10. Read more about how it will affect Chelsea's transfer plans Chelsea cannot continue their efforts to renew the contracts of their players, with expiring deals like Antonio Rudiger, Cesar Azpilicueta and Andreas Christensen having been previously high on their agenda. Their deals run out in the summer, as do the contracts of several talented youth players, including Xavier Simons. It could force the club to hold onto all players currently under contract, due to their inability to bring players in, should the issue not be resolved in the near future. Chelsea's main shirt sponsor, 3, is known to be reviewing its deal with Chelsea. “Sanctions placed on Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich by the UK Government casts a shadow over Chelsea’s many commercial agreements, including its $52.5 million (£40m) front-of-shirt deal with Telecom’s brand 3, and its $72m (£55m) kit deal with Nike,” says Conrad Wiacek, Head of Sport Analysis at GloblalData, a leading data and analytics company. “While Chelsea has a sporting licence to continue trading as a soccer club, many brands will be wary of guilt by association. “Chelsea FC is still one of the biggest clubs in the world and its on-field success still makes it an attractive commercial partner. However, given the rate at which many brands are looking to dissociate themselves from the Russian state, some may be wary of continuing partnerships. “Nike’s deal with Chelsea runs until 2032, so the apparel brand may decide to wait the situation out until the club’s sale is able to continue. However, brands such as Hyundai and Hublot, which have deals worth over $20m (£15m) combined expiring at the end of 2021-22 season, may not have that luxury.” Chelsea will be allowed to spend some money on staging matches at Stamford Bridge and in travelling to away matches. A spending limit of just £20,000, however, applies to travel to away games, and could cause issues with preparations for Champions League fixtures in particular. The club will also  have to prove that such costs are 'reasonable costs'. Chelsea are also barred from receiving any revenue from merchandising sales, but will be allowed to take revenue from broadcasting matches. Abramovich is said to be worth £9 billion ($12bn) and valued Chelsea at £3bn ($4bn) during his negotiations to sell the club. It is currently unclear if or when the sanctions will be lifted. It relates directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin's activity and the invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions will be reviewed in May, but there are further risks of a nine-point deduction should Chelsea go into administration. In the statement released by the UK Government, it describes Abramovich as a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch who has been involved in destabilising Ukraine."" He is further described as having a ""close relationship with Putin"" and providing steel for tanks in Russia's offensive. Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated in his government's release: ""There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin’s vicious assault on Ukraine. ""Today’s sanctions are the latest step in the UK’s unwavering support for the Ukrainian people. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/life-after-ronaldo-how-juventus-are-coping-without-cristiano/i7zn0g5c9t1t18qz0qiq6cfyx,Life after Ronaldo? How Juventus are coping without Cristiano,"It wasn’t Cristiano Ronaldo’s Juventus departure which shocked his former team-mates. It was the timing. It had been clear for months that the Portugal international wanted out. He repeatedly passed up opportunities to commit his future to the club, most amusingly when he lashed out at the media for reporting his desire to return to Real Madrid, even though one of his closest associates, Edu Aguirre of El Chiringuito, had sparked the speculation in typically over-the-top fashion live on Spanish television. Ronaldo claimed that such talk was “disrespectful to all of the clubs involved in these rumours, as well as to their players and staff”, and yet not once did he mention Juventus in a 286-word statement on social media. The writing had long been on the wall, of course. During Euro 2020, he would only say: ""Whether I stay at Juventus or leave, whatever happens will be for the best."" However, while there were – and are – obvious advantages to his eventual transfer to Manchester United for the Bianconeri, most notably from a financial perspective,his decision to leave fourdays before the close of the summer transfer window had a negative impact on his colleagues. As captain Giorgio Chiellini told DAZN, “Ronaldo left on August 27. It would have been better for us if he had left earlier.“We paid something for it, a little bit of a shock, we paid something for it in terms of points. If he had left earlier, we would have had time to prepare better.”  As it was, Ronaldo’s move to Manchester was confirmed a matter of hours beforeJuventus were beaten at home by Empoli in their second game of the new Serie A season. The international break presented coach Massimiliano Allegri, back at the helm after two years away, with a much-needed opportunity to take stock, but his still shell-shocked side were beaten again upon their return to action, at Napoli, and were then held to a draw at home by AC Milan. At the close of play on matchday four, the mighty Juventus were in the Serie A relegation zone.It was obvious that Ronaldo’s lethal finishing was being sorely missed - but it went beyond mere goals. For the previous three seasons, ever since the arrival of the prolific Portuguese from Real Madrid, Juve’s primary focus had become getting the very best out of their No.7. As centre-back Leonardo Bonucci said earlier this week, “the team played for [Ronaldo].” However, the Euro 2020 winner also acknowledged that the players were guilty of expecting miracles from Ronaldo whenever they found themselves in a tight spot. “We were all playing with a great champion and wanted him to do well,” Bonucci explained to reporters, “so perhaps we lost that desire to all suffer and sacrifice ourselves together, because we assumed he would sort it out."" Bonucci believes that Allegri has, at least, already addressed the attitude problem, arguing that the passion and resilience they have demonstrated in racking up six successive wins in all competitions proves that the players have rediscovered that ""Juve spirit that was there before Ronaldo’s arrival"". ""The coach has done really well to get that character and humility back,"" he enthused. “We all work together now to get the result."" Waking up with this energy! 🔋💪#ZenitJuve #JuveUCL pic.twitter.com/3RalE2ch1Y That Juvehave won their last four games 1-0 also suggests that Allegri has resolved the defensive issues which preceded his summer return. Before Manuel Locatelli scored the only goal in the derby against Torino at the start of this month, the Old Lady hadn’t kept a clean sheet in the league since the 3-0 defeat of Spezia on March 2. Of course, one of the principal reasons for Juve’s sudden stinginess is the fact that they are playing a more negative brand of football, often sitting deep against decent footballing sides in the hope of hitting their opponents on the break, or nicking a goal off a set-piece. Such an approach can only last so long. Juve, after all, are still playing catch-up in Serie A. They may be rapidly rising up the table but they are still only seventh, seven points behind Napoli.The onus is on them to close the gap and they will only be able to continue winning games if they add more goals to their game. Paulo Dybala’s return from injury for this weekend’s Derby d’Italia is, therefore, a most welcome boost. The Argentine remains Juve’s joint-top scorer in all competitions with three goals–even though he has missed five games through injury. It was Chiellini, remember, who tipped Dybala to take command of the Juve attack following Ronaldo’s exit.   And yet, for all of the financial and tactical conundrums that the Portuguese presented, the Bianconeri could always rely on him to score goals (Ronaldoalready has six in eight games for United). They can’t even rely on Dybala to stay fit. However, the hope is that his returnwill at least lighten the load on Federico Chiesa, who kickstarted Juve’s campaign with a virtuoso showing at Spezia on matchday five, while also netting the winner in their morale-boosting 1-0 win over Chelsea in the Champions League. The Italy winger still needs to add even more goals to his game but there is no denying his status as one of the best big-game players in the world right now – which obviously bodes well ahead of Sunday’s trip to San Siro. Of course, if Juve are to maintain their winning streak against free-scoring Inter, who have netted nearly twice as many goals as the Bianconeri in the league this season (23-12), they are likely to have to once again produce a heroic rearguard action. And that doesn’t just mean Chiellini & Co. doing their jobs. Allegri will need his infamously unreliable and unbalanced midfield to protect his back four and his forwards to defend from the front. Still, on the evidence of what we’ve seen in recent weeks, Bonucci may well be proven right: Ronaldo’s goals may be gone but Juve’s fighting spirit does at least seem to have returned.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/worlds-best-right-back-james-chelsea-champions-league/bltf2a1978fbe296900,The world's best right-back? James confirming his status as a Chelsea - and Champions League - superstar,"Reece James and the Champions League are striking up a special relationship, even if there have been some bumps along the way. He enjoyed one of his early breakout moments in the Chelsea team when he netted the equaliser for the Blues in their memorable 4-4 draw with Ajax in 2019, though what followed in Europe that season he would sooner forget. A 7-1 aggregate loss to Bayern Munich was humbling for James, who was run ragged by an emerging Alphonso Davies, highlighting the size of the step up he was needing to take having spent the previous season on loan in the Championship at Wigan Athletic. Fast-forward 12 months, and having been guided by Thomas Tuchel, James was lifting the European Cup in Porto having been one of the outstanding performers in Chelsea's win over Manchester City. Targeted by Pep Guardiola, James put in a supreme defensive display, highlighting the fact that he is more than just an attacking full-back who struggles when closer to his own goal. That is not to say that his attacking output has diminished, and on Tuesday he again showed himself to be a constant threat in the final third as he helped put Juventus to the sword at Stamford Bridge. The Champions League is the stage for the world's best players, and right now it is difficult to find anyone in better form or who is more well-rounded than James as a right-back. Reece James is an absolute joke! 🤭Another outstanding finish from the Chelsea star! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/iUdgv2XI8A REECE JAMES. 💥CHELSEA'S DEFENDERS HAVE NOW SCORED 16 GOALS THIS SEASON. UNREAL. 😳 pic.twitter.com/bKVZorYYES His arrowed strike across Wojciech Szczesny for Chelsea's second in their 4-0 win over the Bianconeri means he is now the Blues' outright top scorer this season with five goals, moving him ahead of £97.5 million ($136m) summer signing Romelu Lukaku, who has four. James also has five assists to his name, with there only one other Premier League player with at least five goals and five assists in all competitions so far in 2021-22: Mohamed Salah. The England international also played his part in the third goal of the night, showing deft control in box in the build-up to Callum Hudson-Odoi firing home, as well as the fourth, as his sensational cross-field ball helped create Timo Werner's stoppage-time strike. There will be staunch opposition to the take that James is the best right-back in the world on current form from Liverpool supporters who back Trent Alexander-Arnold, and there are certainly arguments that can be made for both players. But James' superior defensive abilities, as well his new-found eye for goal just gives him the edge, and that is an opinion that Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate seems to share if his selections over the past 12 months are been anything to go by. Despite all that, Tuchel was cautious to name James as the best in the world in his position when asked by GOAL during Monday's press conference, perhaps in a bid to keep the 21-year-old focused on getting even better. ""Right now he plays as a wing-back, and he does this at a very high level,"" the German coach said. ""I see no reason why we should get carried away by things like if he is the best in the world or the best in England or the best in Europe. ""If he plays, he needs to be the best version of himself. He is improving, he takes responsibility and it is needed. ""He is far from finished in his development. He is super young. He has all the potential to be a big and important player for Chelsea and he is on his way. ""I feel he is dedicated and hungry for more, and that is what we want."" James himself is a man of few words, but when asked by GOAL about his current form during the recent international break, he said: ""I would say this is the best that I have ever performed. Recent results and performances have shown that as well."" Before he met Tuchel, James was already an exceptional talent. He was the captain of Jody Morris' FA Youth Cup-winning team in 2018, and won the club's Academy Player of the Year award in the process. He followed that up by being nominated for EFL Team of the Season in his first year as a professional at Wigan, but he remained a rough diamond. Tuchel has polished that diamond, accentuating his physical and ball-striking gifts by simplifying James' game with clear instructions about what he can and cannot do in his system. It led to a baptism of fire for James last season, where he was in and out of the team, facing the brunt of Tuchel's tirades from the touchline. But along with his tactical improvements, he has added more mobility to his game, allowing him to be in positions to score more often, and turning him the complete wing-back. The world's best? Right now, it is difficult to argue against it. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/hudson-odoi-england-ghana-national-team-dilemma-chelsea-club/blt3f5741b3bbcfa1cd,Hudson-Odoi addresses England or Ghana national team dilemma after Chelsea's Club World Cup triumph,"Callum Hudson-Odoi addressed the dilemma he is facing over which national team to choose between England and Ghana following Chelsea's Club World Cup triumph on Saturday. Hudson-Odoi represented England at every youth level from U16 to U21 before making his first senior international appearance in 2019. However, the 21-year-old has only been able to take his tally of caps to three since then and he was left out of Gareth Southgate's last Three Lions squad in November, leading to question marks over his future. Hudson-Odoi is also eligible to play for Ghana due to his heritage and, under current FIFA rules, any players that have played three or fewer international games before the age of 21 are allowed to switch allegiances if they choose to. The Chelsea winger has not featured for England in two-and-a-half years, but has now given the clearest indication yet that he remains determined to break into Southgate's squad. Speaking after the Blues' 2-1 win against Palmeiras in Abu Dhabi, Hudson-Odioi replied when asked whether he would commit his international future to the Three Lions and reject Ghana: “Hopefully. I don’t know. ""At the end of the day, we will wait until that time comes.” Hudson-Odoi also explained why he decided to snub a loan move away from Chelsea last summer amid reported interest from Borussia Dortmund. The Blues' academy graduate, who recorded an assist for Lukaku's opener against Palmeiras, says he is relieved to have had the chance to revel in more success under Thomas Tuchel. “You want to win as much as possible with a club like this,” said Hudson-Odoi. “Our aim is always to win games and win as many as possible. ""If I went out in the summer I wouldn’t get opportunities to play like this and win trophies. I’m really delighted that I stayed and obviously I got the opportunity to play. ""For me I’ve just got to give it 120 per cent from minute one every single game.” Pressed on whether he can already be considered a Chelsea legend with Club World Cup and Champions League winners' medals now on his record, he added: “I don’t feel like a legend at all. I’m young, I’ve got a long way to go. I’m delighted to win trophies. ""You keep adding and adding to the cabinet and it’s nice. But you can’t say you’re a legend at 21.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The English side have a two-goal advantage after the first leg at Anfield and will be targeting a favourable result to make it to the final.  Keita has already featured in eight matches in the competition this season, scoring one goal in the process. Last weekend, the Guinea midfielder scored the only goal of the match to hand his team maximum points in the Premier League away to Newcastle.  The German tactician is happy with the 27-year-old's form ahead of the game away to the Yellow Submarine.  ""Long may that [form] continue because that is crucial, that is key to everything,"" Klopp said in a presser ahead of Tuesday's game.  ""If you have the talent and the skill set of Naby Keita and you are not fit, then nobody sees it, that’s how it is. If you then come back not in the best possible shape, all these kinds of things, that’s normal physically.  ""The player was never in doubt, not for a second, because he’s outstanding. It’s good he is now available. It’s a good option, a very good option to have. Played at the weekend was obviously a really good game, so we’ll see how long we will use him tomorrow. A very good option.""  The German tactician insists he has an exceptional squad but went on to state that his team will also need luck to make it to the final.  ""You never know if you will reach a semi-final again if we ever have a chance again to go to the final – you never know,"" Klopp continued.  ""We have an exceptional team here and nothing is [taken] for granted, you need luck in these moments, all these kind of things, so you better treat it carefully and be ready – but we will.  ""We will be ready. We really wanted to be where we are and we want to go to the final. But if Villarreal is better than us and beats us with a result which qualifies them for the final, then congratulations and that's it. ""But between now and then, 95 or whoever knows how many minutes to play. I'm looking forward to it.""  After winning the League Cup, the Reds are chasing the Premier League, the FA Cup and the Champions League titles. They trail Manchester City by one point with four games left in the league, while they face Chelsea in the FA Cup final. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/un-refugee-agency-abmassador-begovic-fleeing-war-torn/blt405be020720cc794,'I still get flashbacks' - UN Refugee Agency ambassador Begovic opens up on fleeing war-torn Yugoslavia,"In a sporting sense, Everton are a club in crisis, with the Premier League side facing relegation from the English top flight for the first time since 1951. Asmir Begovic is acutely aware of the significance of the situation. However, as someone forced to flee war-torn Yugoslavia during his childhood, the 34-year-old goalkeeper also has a real sense of perspective. ""It was a difficult time for my family and I think the more I grew up, the more I think about it differently because the first time we were refugees, I was only four years of age,"" he explains in an exclusive interview with GOAL. ""With the pandemic and not a lot going on, I have had small glimpses in my brain, when something comes up, and I remember the travelling and the boats, and just trying to get to a safer environment. ""I get flashbacks every once in a while travelling in the car, too, not so much of when we had to leave Yugoslavia, but when we later had to leave Germany for Canada. That was difficult. ""We didn't have stability because we were on yearly visas and it was proving impossible to get renewed because our income wasn't enough. ""I remember that a lot more and, obviously, the impact that had on my family. These sorts of situations create a sense of unrest but also resilience and a sense of gratefulness for what you have today, which is a good life. ""It drives you to always do better and gives me a sense of fear of not ever wanting to go back."" Begovic, who was born in Trebinje in Bosnia and Herzegovina, freely admits that even today he struggles to process exactly what he went through. However, there's one thing he's 100 per cent clear on: the incredible sacrifices his parents made to give him the best possible childhood. ""Looking back, it's a combination of things you feel, but I think the biggest thing is the respect for my parents – that is huge. ""As you get older, you have responsibilities in life, and you become a parent yourself. But I could never imagine having to go through some of those situations now. ""Nobody felt sorry for us and you couldn't feel sorry for yourself. My parents worked multiple jobs and my dad gave up playing football to work as a delivery driver. ""My mum was working in restaurants and as a cleaner, then studied to be a nurse while also learning a new language. ""We got through it; my parents made huge sacrifices. When you're put in that situation, it is quite simple: you either stay or go. We left and they worked out everything as they went along."" As a kid ""with a funny German accent"" and a low level of English, Begovic initially found it difficult to settle in Canada. ""Luckily,"" he says, ""I was good at football and that helped me integrate. Of course, when you're younger, you don't overthink these things; you just kind of crack on."" Having continued to excel at football, making a name for himself as a promising young goalkeeper, Begovic eventually returned to Europe to join Portsmouth. However, because he was on a student visa, he couldn't play competitive fixtures. ""When I turned 18, I had to move to Belgium while paperwork was being sorted out,"" he explains. ""And it was to a club I never even heard of – La Louviere. It was also a club in crisis. ""Thankfully, Harry Redknapp came in [as manager of the Portsmouth senior side] and saw something in me. From there, you go to play against great Premier League clubs and play against great players, getting you into the national team. ""And it really was good for me going into the Bosnian national team because a lot of the guys were from refugee families like me, and maybe more German or French because of it. ""For me, it was like flirting with being Bosnian again after settling in the UK. I say it in my academies now: the biggest trait you need to make it as a footballer is resilience."" Begovic's story is certainly proof of that. Despite all of the difficulties he and his family went through, this is a footballer with over 450 professional appearances to his name. Fittingly, he is also now an ambassador for the United Nations Refugee Agency and it pains him to see the human cost of conflicts such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""This role brings back difficult memories,"" he admits. ""No one likes to see people being displaced by wars. It is absolutely awful. ""These wars are just for people's egos. They are fighting over something that wasn't theirs in the first place. ""Nothing good will come of it, it is just suffering and people losing things or, worse, loved ones. ""I try to do what I can to give money to the UN, an unbelievable organisation, or by raising awareness and helping people live their dreams. ""I'd say to people to just be open-minded. These people would rather be getting on with their normal lives and now their lives have been turned upside down. ""Be open-minded, compassionate and helpful as possible. Overall, our society is okay but in these moments we can always do more."" Despite his commendable commitment to addressing the refugee crisis, Begovic also remains intent on doing what he can to help Everton beat the drop. ""I have been blessed to play football for a living and I want to do it as long as I can,"" he says. ""It has obviously been a difficult season for many different reasons. It is just about surviving and kicking on next season. ""We have got a great manager and staff who have achieved everything in the game you could imagine. I knew some of them from my Chelsea days. ""They are resilient people and we won't give up and stop fighting. We're trying our best and want to make the best of a difficult situation."" Just as Begovic has been doing his whole life.

""I'm pretty sure he's got my phone number!"" the Manchester United interim manager tells Sky Sports, standing within the inner confines of a silent Old Trafford late on Thursday evening. ""He's got another couple of games to play with Ajax, we have another three games to play here. Whenever he wants to speak with me and exchange our opinions, I'm more than happy to do that."" Erik ten Hag was appointed more than a week ago as the man to drive United into a new era, one where they're expected to be back challenging for the Premier League title and major trophies, and one which is still to even make the first tentative steps. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It is scarcely believable that nearly 10 years and four permanent managers have passed since Sir Alex Ferguson announced his retirement - the last time United were English football's top dogs. Right now, they are further away than ever from experiencing the same past glories - set to finish this season with their lowest-ever Premier League points total. But Rangnick, despite admitting the club needs ""open heart surgery"", is upbeat the process to get back to the summit might not take long, providing the right changes are made. ""Knowing Erik will be the manager, with a good recruitment process and bringing in the right players, I'm very positive the supporters and the media will be able to see a better team and, at the end, hopefully a better position in the league,"" he said. Man Utd fixtures Premier League table Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments ""There are quite a few good examples in the league with when Jurgen Klopp came to Liverpool, Pep Guardiola to Manchester City, Thomas Tuchel came to Chelsea - yes, he came in the middle of the season and inherited a top-quality squad, but you still need to win the Champions League. ""If you know what you're looking for, the profiles of the different positions you need, it shouldn't hopefully take too long."" That is where Rangnick will lend his expertise during his two-year consultancy role while managing the Austria national team. The 63-year-old was not prepared to discuss his new job or how both would be combined going forwards - and would neither offer an opinion on whether Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored eight of the team's last 9 league goals, could fit into Ten Hag's demanding style of play. ""This is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag,"" he said, after Ronaldo rescued United again on Thursday night by scoring the equaliser in their 1-1 with Chelsea. ""He's showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it's obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, it's pretty obvious."" Rangnick wants United to find and develop ""future top, star players"" who can be moulded into the club's ways rather than buying a player who is already the finished product, as they have been keen to do in recent years. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The interim boss believes combining that approach with consistent recruitment at each opportunity can, again, move United closer to the country's top teams. ""If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window,"" he said. ""They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. ""I wouldn't be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks. This shows it is possible that this can happen and it would not necessarily need three, four years in order to do that."" Ironically, United face Brentford on Monday Night Football, live on Sky Sports, a club renowned for their work in the transfer market. The Bees have reached the top-flight with their Moneyball-style use of data to drive their player recruitment - making only four signings last summer to help comfortably keep them in the Premier League for a second season. Rangnick rightly points out the difference in size between United and Brentford, which has to be taken into consideration when the two are signing players and their approach to it, but agrees every club needs to follow an 'idea'. ""No matter which club, it is always necessary and important that you need an idea,"" he said. ""You need to know how you want to play, what kind of profiles do we need because if you do not do that, you're always looking for the needle in the haystack. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""This is what I meant when I said 'open heart surgery'. I don't think it's enough to do some minor corrections and amendments. I think it's important to see the big picture and then hopefully bring in the best possible players. ""They should also fit together, this is also an issue, it is not only about bringing some players for defence, midfield and up front, it's also important you get to know the personality of the players and that they really fit and are able to meet the standards of this big club."" In the meantime, as United prepare to play their final home game of the season, Rangnick will keep on waiting to share his ideas with the man responsible for rebuilding United.

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/12582098/erik-ten-hag-manchester-united-appoint-ajax-boss-as-new-manager,Erik ten Hag: Manchester United appoint Ajax boss as new manager,"Manchester United have appointed Ajax boss Erik ten Hag as their new manager, to replace interim Ralf Rangnick at the end of the season. Sky Sports News reported on March 31 Ten Hag was in pole position to land the job over Mauricio Pochettino, with sources close to the manager and Ajax revealing compensation is below £2m. The 52-year-old has signed a three-year deal with the option of a further 12 months. He told United's website: ""It is a great honour to be appointed manager of Manchester United and I am hugely excited by the challenge ahead. ""I know the history of this great club and the passion of the fans, and I am absolutely determined to develop a team capable of delivering the success they deserve. ""It will be difficult to leave Ajax after these incredible years, and I can assure our fans of my complete commitment and focus on bringing this season to a successful conclusion before I move to Manchester United."" Mitchell van der Gaag, Ten Hag's assistant at Ajax, is likely to join him at Old Trafford with advanced negotiations already under way. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Edwin van der Sar, Ajax's chief executive and a former United goalkeeper, said, ""we would have liked to have kept Erik for longer"", but added, ""he is going to make the step to one of the biggest clubs in the world"". VOTE: Who should stay or leave Man Utd this summer? Why the scale of Man Utd rebuild is frightening Man Utd exodus: 18 players who could leave this summer Ten Hag Q&A: Carra's verdict on incoming Man Utd boss Ten Hag told Ajax's website: ""I'm happy that it has been finalised and that it has been officially announced. That clarity is important."" John Murtough, United's football director, said: ""During the past four years at Ajax, Erik has proved himself to be one of the most exciting and successful coaches in Europe, renowned for his team's attractive, attacking football and commitment to youth. ""In our conversations with Erik leading up to this appointment, we were deeply impressed with his long-term vision for returning Manchester United to the level we want to be competing at, and his drive and determination to achieve that. ""We wish Erik the best of luck as he focuses on achieving a successful end to the season at Ajax and look forward to welcoming him to Manchester United this summer."" Ten Hag was understood to be the unanimous choice at United following a rigorous recruitment process that was led by Murtough and Darren Fletcher, the technical director. Richard Arnold, the executive vice-chairman, was also involved and the trio are understood to have agreed Ten Hag was the best candidate for the job. Mauricio Pochettino, the Paris Saint-Germain manager who previously coached Tottenham and Southampton, and Julen Lopetegui, the Sevilla boss, were also interviewed by United, but the club are believed to have felt the Dutchman was the one that most closely aligned with their plans for the future. Pochettino and Lopetegui are understood to have interviewed well, while Luis Enrique was also considered until it quickly became apparent he was committed to Spain ahead of this year's World Cup. United were looking for a number of attributes from their new manager, including proven success, a commitment to youth, the ability to improve players and the will to introduce an attractive style of play. Ten Hag is said to have set out his long-term vision to build a successful and exciting team during conversations with United, in which he is also said to have shown enthusiasm for the challenge he now faces at Old Trafford. Sky Sports News understands Ten Hag will tell United players he does not want any passengers at the club. His key message to them will be that he is the manager, there is a new regime and United are going to go back to playing like Manchester United. If there are any players who are not up for the challenge, they are welcome to leave, but everyone will start with a clean slate. He has not been given any specific targets, but he knows his job is to make United great again. Ten Hag also wants Steve McClaren to return to United and talks about making that happen are ongoing. The good relationship between United and Ajax helped smooth the process to appoint Ten Hag. It is believed potential negotiations with PSG, had United opted for Pochettino, would have proved more problematic. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ten Hag will be United's fifth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. The club have won only three trophies in the following nine years - the FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League - while they are currently in danger of missing out on qualification for the Champions League next season. Ten Hag is set to oversee a much-needed rebuild at United, with Rangnick - who is due to take up a consultancy role at Old Trafford this summer - saying after the 4-0 thrashing at rivals Liverpool on Tuesday that the side may need up to 10 new players. A number of first-team players, including Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard and Edinson Cavani, could be set to leave as part of the overhaul, with their contracts expiring at the end of the season. On Wednesday, the departures of Jim Lawlor, United's chief scout, and Marcel Bout, the head of global scouting, were announced. Ralf Rangnick said Manchester United need to sign as many as 10 new players after their 4-0 thrashing by Liverpool on Tuesday night, but which players could leave in their rebuild? Man Utd are currently sixth in the Premier League, three points off the top four but having played a game more than both Tottenham (fourth) and Arsenal (fifth). Will they squeeze into the top four? Here are their remaining fixtures... Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports News' senior reporter Melissa Reddy: ""Manchester United's interest in Erik ten Hag came as no surprise given his status as one of the most progressive coaches in Europe, and his long links to their managerial vacancy. ""The 52-year-old has had admirers at Old Trafford stretching back to 2018/19, when his Ajax side knocked out Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, before then stunning Juventus and only being denied a place in the final after Lucas Moura's last-minute goal for Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham. ""Ten Hag is a popular choice to take charge at Old Trafford and represents what is seen as a ""fresh, exciting future"", although there is an acceptance risk is involved as it is a sizeable leap for him. ""The last highly-successful Ajax coach to move to England's top flight - via Inter - was Frank de Boer, who lasted just 77 days at Crystal Palace. ""The expectations, global glare placed on United, and level of competition at the top end of the Premier League is like nothing he would have previously experienced."" Kaveh Solhekol, Sky Sports' chief reporter: ""The timing is not ideal if you are an Ajax supporter as they are in a race to win the Dutch title, but when Man Utd came calling, Erik ten Hag really could not turn down the club. ""It suits Man Utd to make this statement today for a variety of reasons: from a PR point of view, everybody connected with Man Utd wants some good news at the moment and also, it makes it clear what is happening at Man Utd over the next few months. There is clarity now - all the players who are thinking of leaving, or who Man Utd want to sign, know Ten Hag is going to be the new manager. ""He is also going to have the whole of the summer and pre-season with the players, so that is perfect preparation as far as he is concerned. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I also think it is very significant he is being called the manager - we know one of the things he has been asking for is to be in control of everything. He does not just want to be a head coach - he wants to have control over the transfer strategy and recruitment as well. ""I think Man Utd have made a lot of mistakes when it has come to appointing managers since Sir Alex Ferguson left, but this time round they think they have the right man and obviously he has a big, big job to do. ""But people need to retain a sense of perspective as well - I know the team are not playing as well or in the kind of way a Man Utd team should be playing. But let's not forget, less than 12 months ago, Man Utd finished second in the Premier League, they finished above Liverpool and over the past decade, six of the last 10 seasons they have finished above Liverpool. ""Man Utd are still a massive, massive club - one of the biggest clubs in the world. There are obviously still issues with the ownership structure, the way the club is run, but the big problem is they have not had the right manager in charge, and when they have had the right man, they have not given that manager enough time. ""This time round, when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer lost his job five months ago, we told you the replacement was going to be either Mauricio Pochettino or Erik ten Hag. I know a lot of people would have preferred Pochettino as he had Premier League experience with Southampton and Spurs, so it is a bit of a risk going for Ten Hag. ""Yes, he has done very well in Holland, but he has been managing the biggest club in Holland, he does not have any Premier League experience, but United have spoken to various candidates, they have interviewed Ten Hag, they interviewed Pochettino as well, and they have decided to go for Ten Hag. From United's point of view, it is great they have been able to get Ten Hag and announce it so quickly."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Gary Neville speaking on The Overlap in March: ""Ten Hag worked in Bayern Munich when Pep Guardiola was there. We know the impact that had. He's won a couple of titles and cups in Holland. His style of play is good. He's got more experience than I think most people think at the age of 52. ""It's a massive jump but he's got a good coaching pedigree. He's not scarred and that's a good thing - he comes in fresh. I did a poll the other week and I was absolutely stunned - 220,000 people voted and 82 per cent were in favour of bringing him in over [Mauricio] Pochettino. ""I knew that he would be favourite because you can smell it on social media. I think Manchester United fans are demanding a fresh start and a fresh name. They want something that's completely different that they've not had before, and that's probably gone against Pochettino in some ways."" Sky Sports' Adam Bate: ""Erik ten Hag will go to Manchester United as an outsider tasked with implementing cultural change at one of the world's most famous clubs. But that is a job that he has done before. ""At Ajax, they mocked his accent. He was a Tukker - a man from the east of the country, a region known for a down-to-earth approach. There were those in sophisticated Amsterdam who did not believe the great Ajax had anything to learn from him. They were wrong. ""Two domestic doubles and one kick away from a Champions League final later and there is an acceptance Ten Hag has brought some of the best football that Ajax have seen in years. His methods have delivered success, his manner has won over the doubters."" Ten Hag's coaching journey from Twente to Ajax via Go Ahead Eagles explained in-depth by those who were there from the start... Erik ten Hag must waste no timing in tackling the pressing issues at Manchester United. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick - who is due to take up a consultancy role at Old Trafford this summer - believes the team could require 10 new players as part of a huge rebuild. With United having finally confirmed the appointment of their new manager, Sky Sports takes a look at some of the key problem areas he must rectify... Erik Ten Hag's announcement as Manchester United's new manager means we've ripped up the script for the Essential Football Podcast, with the Dutchman's unveiling heralding - yet another - new era at Old Trafford. Host Ron Walker is joined by Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher as well as senior football writer Peter Smith and features writer Adam Bate to talk about the new man, what United can expect from him and the challenges he faces at Old Trafford.

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/12599944/where-could-each-premier-league-team-finish,Premier League clubs' best and worst possible final positions in table,"Manchester City and Liverpool are locked in a two-horse race for the Premier League title - but how high or low could your club finish this season? Clubs have between two and five games left to seal their fate but 19 out of 20 clubs are still challenging for the title, qualification for the Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League, or to avoid the drop. Data guru Ben Mayhew has calculated each club's range of possible final league positions and found only Norwich have nothing to play for besides pride during the remainder of this season. Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United are all in the hunt to join title-tussling Manchester City and Liverpool in the top four - with Spurs and United potentially slipping as low as eighth to miss out on Europe next season altogether. With seventh spot being the lowest position to potentially offer a European berth, if permutations play out across competitions, it means all teams from fifth to 13th-placed Aston Villa retain the potential to qualify for Europe. Norwich were relegated on Saturday after a 2-0 defeat to Villa and results conspired against them elsewhere, but, theoretically, every single team sitting above the Canaries up to ninth-placed Brighton could finish in the drop zone. Watford have been widely written off in the survival race but the Hornets could still finish in 16th, while the attention for that final relegation spot centres on Everton, Leeds and Burnley - but all three could still secure a top-half finish. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Premier League fixtures Mayhew has also simulated every possible result from the remaining games and calculated the probabilities of each club's possible final positions. The results suggest Manchester City have a 69-per-cent chance of retaining their Premier League crown, while Liverpool have almost the same chance of finishing as runners-up. Chelsea are nailed down for third spot at 93 per cent, with Arsenal pipping Tottenham to the final Champions League berth at 74 per cent - while Manchester United have a whopping 94-per-cent-chance of finishing in their current sixth spot. Each club’s attacking and defensive strength have been rated using an expected goals model, which measures the quality of chances they create and allow.  These ratings were then used to simulate the rest of the season 10,000 times to measure the probability of each club finishing in each league position. Further down the table - between Brighton and Southampton - things become far less predictable, with fairly even spreads between ninth and 15th. The probabilities consign Watford to the Championship but the pressure ramps up for the final drop spot, with Leeds favourites to finish in 18th (46 per cent), followed by Everton (31 per cent) and Burnley (23 per cent).

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/12579011/liverpool-further-in-quadruple-bid-than-any-english-club-in-history,Liverpool's Quadruple quest: How do Jurgen Klopp's side fare in historic bid?,"Liverpool's quest for an historic Quadruple continues when they travel to Villarreal for the second leg of their Champions League semi-final on Tuesday night, with the Reds' bid having now gone further into a season than any other English side before them. Jurgen Klopp's team head to Spain leading 2-0 as they look to progress to the final of Europe's premier club competition in Paris on May 28 against either Man City or Real Madrid. However, even if Liverpool fail to make it to the French capital, they have still managed to surpass the Chelsea side of 2006/07, whose own Quadruple challenge lasted all the way until May 1 of that campaign before losing to Liverpool in the Champions League semi-finals. And if Liverpool do manage to see off Villarreal on Tuesday, their next leg of the Quadruple will come against Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley on May 14, a repeat of this season's League Cup final, which the Reds won on penalties in February. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, in the race for the Premier League, Liverpool still just a point behind City as we enter the final four games of the season after an impressive unbeaten run in the league saw the champions' seemingly unsurmountable 14-point lead on January 15 evaporate. In total, Liverpool could face a gruelling seven-match schedule in May if they make it through to the final of European Cup at the Stade de France. So, how have other English teams got on when faced with such a daunting challenge, while surely the trophy-laden Liverpool sides of the 80s must have gone close to achieving the feat? And what about some of the great European giants of years gone by? Liverpool fixtures Premier League table As is surely common knowledge by now, no English team has ever won the Quadruple. Prior to this season, the closest any top-flight side had ever got to winning all four major trophies in a single campaign was Chelsea back in 2006/07. Heading into May of that season, Jose Mourinho's back-to-back Premier League champions had already landed the League Cup after beating Arsenal 2-1 at the Millennium Stadium, while they had an FA Cup final date to look forward to with Manchester United, who they were also going toe to toe with in the league. However, the Blues' challenge ended when they lost on penalties to Liverpool at Anfield in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final, while they would also go on to lose their title to United. Manchester United also came close to making history in 2008/09, only to slip up in the semi-finals of the FA Cup when losing 4-2 on penalties to Everton, although they did then get beaten 2-0 by Barcelona in that season's Champions League final in Rome. And, of course, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side have had numerous Quadruple bids as well since the Catalan arrived at the Etihad, the closest being in 2018/19 and last season. However, the former challenge was ended by Tottenham in the Champions League last eight and the latter after a defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals. Liverpool's current quest, though, will last at least until May 3, when the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with Villarreal concludes, meaning their Quadruple campaign will have lasted longer than any other English team's in history. And before you ask, Manchester United's famous Treble-winning season of 1998/99 actually included a League Cup quarter-final loss at Spurs in the December of that campaign. You would have thought Liverpool have come close before, but actually they have not, despite winning the League Cup four years in a row from 1981. It was the FA Cup that ultimately proved to be Liverpool's Achilles' heel in each of those four campaigns, with the Reds never managing to make it past the fifth round, meaning the closest they came was in 1982/83, only for a shock 2-1 home defeat to second division Brighton to end their Quadruple dreams in February. And it was Brighton again in the cup who scuppered the Reds' chances of winning all four trophies in their Treble-winning campaign the following season. Oddly enough, despite Klopp's 'Mentality Monsters' barely losing a game between 2018 and 2020, they never actually came close to winning the Quadruple. In fact, the nearest they came to achieving the feat was in their title-winning campaign of 2019/20, only for a youth side - selected because of a fixture clash with the Club World Cup - to lose 5-0 at Aston Villa in the League Cup quarter-finals to put an end that dream. In the first season in England when four trophies were up for grabs in 1960/61, it was Burnley who came closest before losing to Hamburg in the last eight of the European Cup in March 1961. However, Celtic did manage to accomplish the seemingly impossible in 1966-67 when Jock Stein's 'Lisbon Lions' won it all - the Scottish First Division, League Cup and Scottish Cup, followed by the first European Cup won by a British team after victory over Inter Milan. Well, the first thing to point out here is that up until the 2019-20 season, France, as in England, was the only other country in Europe's top-five major leagues to have an extra cup competition in the form of the League Cup, or Coupe de la Ligue. So that explains why European giants like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus have all never previously won the Quadruple. Paris Saint-Germain did, though, recently come within a whisker of pulling it off under Thomas Tuchel, only to fall agonisingly at the final hurdle. The big-spending Parisians were awarded that season's Ligue 1 title in April based on a points-per-game ratio after the campaign was prematurely curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when the season did eventually resume, PSG beat St Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final on July 24, before edging out Lyon 6-5 on penalties to claim the Coupe de la Ligue the following weekend. Then, when the Champions League also returned in August, Tuchel's team made it all the way to the final for the first time in the club's history, before unluckily losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. All of which shows just what a mountain Klopp and Co still face in order to make history this season...

Ronaldo moved level with Heung-min Son in joint second in the Premier League goalscoring charts with his 17th of the season on Thursday, earning United a 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Thursday evening with what was his fifth strike in his last three games for the club. The 37-year-old has scored eight of United's last nine goals, including match-winning hat-tricks against Tottenham and Norwich, in an emphatic response to criticism that came his way earlier in the season during a run of one goal in 10 games. Neville and Keane both highlighted Ronaldo's ill fit for Ten Hag's high-pressing style, but said the five-time Ballon D'Or winner's sheer quality meant he should have a chance to see out the second of his two-year contract at Old Trafford. Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, Neville said: ""He lifts the fans, he gets them on the edge of their seats, takes his chances, and it'll be really interesting to see what happens with Erik Ten Hag. ""We knows he plays with an aggressive press, he tries to win the ball high up the pitch, that isn't Cristiano's strong point and we know that. But he will want a goalscorer. He will want someone who can put the ball in the back of the net 20 or 25 times.

Keane highlighted Ronaldo's mastery of ""the hardest part of the game"" - scoring goals: he has scored 20 times in 12 consecutive league seasons, with the possibility to make that 13 in the final three matches of this campaign. And the former United captain said the bit-part defensive role some former strikers, including Eric Cantona and Ruud Van Nistelrooy, had played during his time at the club shows how Ten Hag could build a pressing team around Ronaldo during his first season at the helm.

The 63-year-old is set to fail in his objective of leading the stuttering club to Champions League qualification but still hopes to leave a lasting legacy at Old Trafford. Rangnick will switch from United's interim boss to a consultancy role in the summer - a job that will run in tandem with his new position as manager of Austria's national team. The German has an impressive track record of developing teams, recently succeeding with RB Leipzig and sister club RB Salzburg, and believes transfers are key to providing incoming boss Erik ten Hag that platform to succeed. ""For me, the most important bit is recruitment now,"" Rangnick said when asked what he will be advising on. ""This is, for me, the most vital point, that we bring in the best possible players and speak about that, who could that be. ""It's not only identifying those players but meeting them, convincing them to join this club, even though we will not be playing in the Champions League. Get Sky Sports Premier League table Man Utd fixtures Transfer Centre LIVE! ""This is what I see as the most important bit.

""Again, on the other hand, just tell me five players that might be some of those players that you spoke about."" When Haaland and Kylan Mbappe were reeled off, Rangnick said: ""Haaland is a young player. He's 21 or 22. This is one of those players I spoke about. ""But, on the other hand, he has developed in the last two years into one of probably the most expensive strikers in the world. ""But, yes, he could be, he would be one of those examples where I think the focus should be on to try and identify and find and then convince players who could be Manchester United players for the next couple of years."" Rangnick believes United's support, stadium and training facilities still make them an attractive proposition irrespective of Champions League qualification. But that view also comes with a dose of realism given rivals Manchester City and Liverpool are flying high, with the club targeting the ""full package"" of ""mentality, quality, physicality, pace, skills"" in new players. Rangnick says it is obvious that the team need additions given their struggles and departing players, with Monday's match against Brentford looking to be an Old Trafford farewell for out-of-contract Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic. ""I would like to (play them) but it's also about getting the best possible result and the best possible performance,"" he said. ""It's not about making any gifts to players.

Asked if Sancho was having his tonsils out, Rangnick added: ""It could happen.

The issue was discussed by UEFA at its Executive Committee meeting last week, and a vote will be taken at the UEFA Congress in Vienna on May 10. It is expected to be ratified then. When it is, for the first time in history, European football qualification will be based on something other than the season that has just finished. The proposals mean that, from 2024, there will be an extra two places in the Champions League reserved for European clubs who have failed to qualify via their domestic league, but who have traditionally done well in Europe's elite club competition. To use hypothetical examples from this current Premier League season, it would mean that if Chelsea, as reigning European champions, finished fifth in the Premier League, they would nevertheless stand a good chance of still qualifying for a Champions League spot for the following season. They currently rank fourth on UEFA's 10-year club coefficient. However, if West Ham were to finish fifth, they would not gain a place in the Champions League because they don't have a strong enough historical record in Europe. In fact, there are 89 clubs ahead of them in the 10-year rankings. One senior executive at a Premier League club told me that this means, for the very first time, the introduction of a ""two-tier system"" - one for the biggest clubs, one for the rest. CL wildcards - your questions answered PL or CL? What do Man City and Liverpool need to win? CL reforms 'Super League via back door', warns fans group Find out more about Sky Sports It's important to stress the new rules won't come into play until 2024. That same executive says there is also the danger of ""a creep effect"", where more and more places in the Champions League are allocated by historical European performance and not by current domestic success. ""It's almost like this is 'European Super League Lite', and the fear is that two might become four, might become eight - with the Champions League becoming more and more of a closed shop,"" they said. The idea that most worries other clubs is the idea of ""leap-frogging"" whereby a team finishing fifth in the Premier League automatically goes into the Europa League, and yet a team finishing behind them in sixth could be ""bumped"" into a more profitable Champions League spot - if they have a better ""coefficient"", or history in European football. Sky Sports News understands all 20 Premier League clubs unanimously asked league officials in 2021 to oppose UEFA's proposal for wildcard places that might lead to ""leap-frogging"" and the inevitable sporting integrity issues. It's thought the Premier League is still lobbying UEFA, via the European Leagues group, for the idea to be removed, with some apparent success. One such meeting happened on Tuesday, I'm told. As a result, it now looks likely that ""leap-frogging"" will be banned under the new UEFA plans, but the coefficient calculation will remain. That allows the possibility for the Big Six in England to all qualify for the Champions League each season, so long as they finish in the top six places in the Premier League. The sixth-placed team will qualify so long as the fifth-placed team does, and so long as their coefficient is among the top two from all of England, Spain, Italy and Germany. In the last year since the European Super League collapsed, a number of officials have told me that the ""coefficient qualification issue"" was a hugely controversial piece of football legislation that was offered in the background to help appease the biggest clubs in Europe and England. The hope was that, if the big clubs had some sort of safety net for missing out on Champions League qualification, they would drop their plans for a breakaway league. It worked. With the exception of Juventus, Barcelona and Real Madrid, the other nine elite clubs all backed out of the European Super League when offered this ""face-saving compromise"", and when confronted with the huge backlash from supporters. However, there has always been strong feeling within the bulk of Premier League clubs, I'm told, that this plan for wildcards to help the biggest clubs qualify for the Champions League is against the spirit of the game. They felt last year, and still do now, that the hugely significant changes had sneaked in almost unnoticed amid the noise and controversy surrounding the European Super League. One official has told us: ""They (Europe's elite clubs) got what they wanted from UEFA. They wanted a safety net, in case they missed out on qualification, and that's exactly what they are going to be given. ""The European Super League was a sideshow - it couldn't practically happen. But a ""super league"" within UEFA, via the Champions League, very much could happen."" In addition, in the aftermath of the collapse of the European Super League, the Premier League vowed to introduce a new Owners Charter which would provide legal guarantees that clubs couldn't try to break away in the future. The Government at the time said it was fully behind those plans to introduce ""appropriate legislation"" to protect football from breakaway leagues. In the year since the collapse of the European Super League, the Charter is yet to be agreed upon, or put to a vote. In fact, whilst it was on the Premier League shareholders' agenda in the first few months after the European Super League, it isn't any longer. Sky Sports News has been told by one club executive that the Owners Charter has been ""kicked into the long grass for now"" with no prospect of it being voted upon at any of the upcoming Premier League shareholders' meetings. Sources say it is simply too sensitive a subject between clubs to discuss right now. In the meantime, UEFA is still haggling over the final details of how the wildcard system will work, and there may be compromises in terms of the fixture congestion that the new Champions League format poses to the English football calendar. But compromises to the 'coefficient system' I'm told, are very unlikely. The idea of two extra wildcard places for the tournament is set in stone. And traditionally, whatever is put before the UEFA Executive Committee is voted through, so big changes are afoot next month. Another controversial issue still being discussed is the idea that the winners of the FA Cup might be able to claim a place in the Champions League. If there was to be a fifth Champions League spot available for the FA Cup winners, that would be unanimously applauded, I'm told. But that's not what's on offer. The proposal is that the FA Cup winners will only get a Champions League spot if their European coefficient is high enough - if they have traditionally done well in Europe. Again, this favours the big clubs. Of the current FA Cup semi-finalists, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Crystal Palace, Palace alone would miss out on the new European wildcard system if they were to lift the trophy. City, Liverpool and Chelsea's success in Europe would mean they would be very likely to get a wildcard into the Champions League, if they won the FA Cup (and didn't finish in the Premier League top four). And so, as one executive put it me, you could have two teams lining up at Wembley for the final potentially ""with very different prizes on offer to each."" ""The same prize has to be awarded whoever wins a trophy, and the idea you can get ""bumped"" is just wrong."" Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

Jurgen Klopp's team head to Spain leading 2-0 as they look to progress to the final of Europe's premier club competition in Paris on May 28 against either Man City or Real Madrid. However, even if Liverpool fail to make it to the French capital, they have still managed to surpass the Chelsea side of 2006/07, whose own Quadruple challenge lasted all the way until May 1 of that campaign before losing to Liverpool in the Champions League semi-finals. And if Liverpool do manage to see off Villarreal on Tuesday, their next leg of the Quadruple will come against Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley on May 14, a repeat of this season's League Cup final, which the Reds won on penalties in February. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, in the race for the Premier League, Liverpool still just a point behind City as we enter the final four games of the season after an impressive unbeaten run in the league saw the champions' seemingly unsurmountable 14-point lead on January 15 evaporate. In total, Liverpool could face a gruelling seven-match schedule in May if they make it through to the final of European Cup at the Stade de France. So, how have other English teams got on when faced with such a daunting challenge, while surely the trophy-laden Liverpool sides of the 80s must have gone close to achieving the feat? And what about some of the great European giants of years gone by? Liverpool fixtures Premier League table As is surely common knowledge by now, no English team has ever won the Quadruple. Prior to this season, the closest any top-flight side had ever got to winning all four major trophies in a single campaign was Chelsea back in 2006/07. Heading into May of that season, Jose Mourinho's back-to-back Premier League champions had already landed the League Cup after beating Arsenal 2-1 at the Millennium Stadium, while they had an FA Cup final date to look forward to with Manchester United, who they were also going toe to toe with in the league. However, the Blues' challenge ended when they lost on penalties to Liverpool at Anfield in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final, while they would also go on to lose their title to United. Manchester United also came close to making history in 2008/09, only to slip up in the semi-finals of the FA Cup when losing 4-2 on penalties to Everton, although they did then get beaten 2-0 by Barcelona in that season's Champions League final in Rome. And, of course, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side have had numerous Quadruple bids as well since the Catalan arrived at the Etihad, the closest being in 2018/19 and last season. However, the former challenge was ended by Tottenham in the Champions League last eight and the latter after a defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals. Liverpool's current quest, though, will last at least until May 3, when the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with Villarreal concludes, meaning their Quadruple campaign will have lasted longer than any other English team's in history. And before you ask, Manchester United's famous Treble-winning season of 1998/99 actually included a League Cup quarter-final loss at Spurs in the December of that campaign. You would have thought Liverpool have come close before, but actually they have not, despite winning the League Cup four years in a row from 1981. It was the FA Cup that ultimately proved to be Liverpool's Achilles' heel in each of those four campaigns, with the Reds never managing to make it past the fifth round, meaning the closest they came was in 1982/83, only for a shock 2-1 home defeat to second division Brighton to end their Quadruple dreams in February. And it was Brighton again in the cup who scuppered the Reds' chances of winning all four trophies in their Treble-winning campaign the following season. Oddly enough, despite Klopp's 'Mentality Monsters' barely losing a game between 2018 and 2020, they never actually came close to winning the Quadruple. In fact, the nearest they came to achieving the feat was in their title-winning campaign of 2019/20, only for a youth side - selected because of a fixture clash with the Club World Cup - to lose 5-0 at Aston Villa in the League Cup quarter-finals to put an end that dream. In the first season in England when four trophies were up for grabs in 1960/61, it was Burnley who came closest before losing to Hamburg in the last eight of the European Cup in March 1961. However, Celtic did manage to accomplish the seemingly impossible in 1966-67 when Jock Stein's 'Lisbon Lions' won it all - the Scottish First Division, League Cup and Scottish Cup, followed by the first European Cup won by a British team after victory over Inter Milan. Well, the first thing to point out here is that up until the 2019-20 season, France, as in England, was the only other country in Europe's top-five major leagues to have an extra cup competition in the form of the League Cup, or Coupe de la Ligue. So that explains why European giants like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus have all never previously won the Quadruple. Paris Saint-Germain did, though, recently come within a whisker of pulling it off under Thomas Tuchel, only to fall agonisingly at the final hurdle. The big-spending Parisians were awarded that season's Ligue 1 title in April based on a points-per-game ratio after the campaign was prematurely curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when the season did eventually resume, PSG beat St Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final on July 24, before edging out Lyon 6-5 on penalties to claim the Coupe de la Ligue the following weekend. Then, when the Champions League also returned in August, Tuchel's team made it all the way to the final for the first time in the club's history, before unluckily losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. All of which shows just what a mountain Klopp and Co still face in order to make history this season...

Eight years after moving to David Moyes's Manchester United from Chelsea, the Spanish number eight appeared to wave goodbye in style. In United's 3-0 win over Brentford on Monday night, Mata rolled back the years to his early Premier League days - who knows if we'll see him in England's top flight again? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mata showed pace, precision and skill that defies his veteran years - linking up with Cristiano Ronaldo frequently in a commanding first-half display. The pair - with a combined age of 71 - showed intricate passing in tight spaces which forced Mata to shoot wide of David Raya's goal - before the duo linked up again for Ronaldo's goal that was ruled out by VAR for offside. Ralf Rangnick recognised how much better United played and perhaps Mata was the cause of that. United had 74 per cent possession of the ball in the first half, with a passing accuracy of 91 per cent. ""That is the reason why we were controlling the game,"" said the German. ""It had to do with the players on the pitch such as Juan, Bruno [Fernandes] and Nemanja Matic."" While players such as Matic have confirmed they will be leaving United this summer, Mata is yet to do so. Rangnick couldn't confirm what the Spaniard will do, but hailed the midfielder's skill and professionalism in equal measure. Premier League table Premier League results Watch Premier League highlights Get Sky Sports ""I don't know [what he will do], he hasn't confirmed that but it's possible [that he will leave]. It was an important night for players who have been here quite a long time. If it was their last game to say farewell like this. ""In the last couple of weeks, he showed how professional he is and how much he loves his game. You can feel and see how much he is a professional player. He almost played like a magician.""Sam Blitz This was Brentford's first defeat with Christian Eriksen in the starting line-up but the Dane was blameless for that at Old Trafford. He was their outstanding performer and one of the best players on the pitch throughout, showcasing that trademark distribution. ""He has been so good, Eriksen,"" said Gary Neville on co-commentary for Sky Sports, before wondering about the player's future in the summer. ""There will be clubs a lot higher up than Brentford looking at him. Manchester United need a new midfield…"" Whether that move will come to fruition is unclear but Eriksen will clearly have options. Despite this being a convincing victory for Manchester United - Brentford were well beaten - the playmaker still created more chances than any player on the home team. It is wonderful to see Eriksen performing at something close to his best. Having proven his fitness and at only 30 years old, there are not many squads that he would not improve. It will be intriguing to find out what he decides to do next. For now, just enjoy him.Adam Bate Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In a World Cup year, the credentials of most of England's regular talent are examined in detail, but none more so than the number one position. Based on Sunday's superhuman display, Gareth Southgate needn't look any further than Jordan Pickford in Qatar - his performance may even be good enough to convince the staunchest of doubters. On a day where Everton's survival bid depended on three points, their goalkeeper was a man mountain. In actual fact, Pickford may have registered not one but two submissions for 'save of the season' - denying both Cesar Azpilicueta and Antonio Rudiger with monumental stops in the second half. ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves,"" said Sky Sports' Graeme Souness. It's difficult to disagree. The Toffees approach to the game was aggressive and that worked to unsettle Chelsea, who were a shade below their level best. Regardless, no player epitomised the game plan more than Pickford, who was dogged and antagonistic from the off. The 28-year-old had to be at his acrobatic best to preserve an all-important clean sheet and coped impressively under some relentless pressure, with Lampard reaffirming why he is so highly thought of on Merseyside: ""Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top level goalkeeping."" In the two Premier League meetings between Everton and Chelsea this season, the England international has managed 14 saves, conceding just once. The result may well be the spark Everton require to pull off a remarkable escape with five games remaining. Needless to say, they will have to exhibit a similar amount of stubbornness in every fixture between now and the end of term if that bid is to be successful.Laura Hunter Everton captain Seamus Coleman: ""That save he came back off the line and parried out was world class, and we see that on a daily basis in training, and that is why he is England's number one - some of the saves were world class.""   Everton boss Frank Lampard: ""Jordan made great saves. They are Chelsea and will have chances, but we had chances as well. Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top-level goalkeeping, I am happy with him and all the players, and all the subs who came on.""   Sky Sports' Graeme Souness: ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves. Some of the saves he's not entitled to get anywhere near them.""

On a day when Mikel Arteta's side were some way below their fluid best, their stand-in centre-back typified the grit that got them over the line. Holding, starting alongside Gabriel Magalhaes in the absence of the injured Ben White, ensured Arsenal did not miss a player who had started more Premier League minutes than any other this season. He took his goal superbly, rising between two West Ham defenders to flick Bukayo Saka's corner past Lukasz Fabianski, but it was at the other end of the pitch that he truly shone. Shortly before his goal, there was a stunning block to deny the unmarked Manuel Lanzini. It was one of three he made over the course of the 90 minutes - two more than any other player. Holding put his body on the line repeatedly and also made nearly twice as many clearances (seven) as any of his team-mates. He was brave but also smart, positioning himself intelligently to cut out passes and ensure West Ham's forwards rarely threatened. Arteta was delighted by his contribution and talked up his importance in the dressing room - even if he does not get as many opportunities as he would like on the pitch. ""To good people, good things happen,"" said the Arsenal manager in his press conference. ""He's a phenomenal person and when you ask him to come, he's always ready."" With four, nerve-shredding games remaining in a gruelling top-four race, Holding's grit is sure to be needed again. Nick Wright Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tottenham's season has reached a defining stage. The long-awaited north London derby comes after a trip to title-chasing Liverpool, a daunting double before season-ending fixtures against Burnley and already-relegated Norwich. Sunday's victory over Leicester ensured Spurs' destiny remains in their hands ahead of the run-in and provided yet more evidence that Antonio Conte's squad harbours the talent required to complete a task that looked so unlikely when the Italian was appointed. Only Mohamed Salah has more Premier League goals to his name this season than Heung-min Son after the South Korean took his tally to 19 for the campaign in style with Spurs' spectacular third against the Foxes. It came after Son's first-half corner had set up Harry Kane for Tottenham's opener, with the striker ending his five-game goal drought with a clinical stooping header. The rekindling of Kane's goalscoring touch was enhanced by the impact surprise omission Dejan Kulusevski had coming off the bench and setting up both of Son's goals. Spurs' front three are firing - at the perfect time. If Spurs are going to pip north London rivals Arsenal to Champions League football, their front three are going to be crucial. Ahead of a pivotal final four games of the season, the manner of the victory over Leicester should have instilled confidence they can get the job done.Jack Wilkinson Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  North London is chasing. That's what will be at the forefront of Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel's mind after conceding defeat to a team blighted by potential relegation concerns. Perhaps Chelsea legs were tired - a legitimate grievance given they played away at Manchester United three days ago - but their performance was reserved, almost standoffish. Chelsea were far too kind to a side whose desperation could have easily played into their own hands. Chances were spurned, despite a heroic display from Everton stopper Jordan Pickford - over half of Chelsea's attempted shots (11) were off target. And yet there was still no sign of Romelu Lukaku from the bench. Third spot is still the Blues to lose, but both Arsenal and Tottenham are closing in. Stamford Bridge will now be cautiously looking over its proverbial shoulder. Three of Chelsea's six Premier League losses this season have come in their last six games - so is form a problem ahead of an FA Cup final against high-flying Liverpool on May 14? Well, it's clear that a prerequisite of the Chelsea job is silverware - something that Tuchel has previously delivered. But this season threatens to crumble if Chelsea manage to slip out of the top-four race and allow favourites Liverpool to clinch the FA Cup. The latter is the likelier of scenarios, but Chelsea must remain alert. They face Wolves, Leeds, Leicester and Watford in the Premier League run-in; crucially, three of those fixtures are at home. The Blues must draw upon their Stamford Bridge dominance to see them through a tricky patch and ensure they supersede their London rivals in the hunt for a top three finish.Laura Hunter Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Leicester have conceded 14 goals from corners in the Premier League this season, the most of any side, and it once again led to their downfall at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The visitors had started promisingly, with Patson Daka striking the foot of a post from inside the Tottenham area. But against the run of play the hosts took the lead when Harry Kane headed in from a corner, completely unmarked, which spurred them on to a 3-1 victory. Rodgers made eight changes to his side, with their focus firmly on the Europa Conference League semi-finals, yet no matter who they have fielded during this campaign, defending corners has been a constant issue. ""Defending corners has been a problem for us all season - we lack aggression and cuteness. It was so disappointing,"" said Rodgers, whose side have surpassed the most conceded in a single season since Brighton's 16 in 2017-18. ""It is something we will have to look at in the summer through personnel.

The final obstacle in Liverpool's quest to reach a third Champions League final in five seasons sees them head to Spain with a 2-0 advantage after last week's comprehensive first-leg victory at Anfield. Despite holding a commanding advantage, Klopp is under no illusions there is still a job to be done and is relishing the challenge that only Champions League semi-finals produce. ""We know that it is half-time,"" Klopp told his pre-match press conference. ""In the best possible way we have to ignore the result from the first leg. If it were a cup game where only one game decided, and we had to go to Villarreal, we would try to win there. ""We know they will give all they have, that is absolutely clear. With all the things Unai said after the game… it's going to be a tough one but that is completely fine. Champions League semi-finals should be tough; we never expect them to be easy and this will not be easy. But we played a good game at home and we better play a good game there as well."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Klopp continued: ""At this moment, a Champions League semi-final is the most important game you can play. Whatever happened in the last few weeks or will happen in the next few weeks is not important, for this moment is clear. ""You never know if you will reach a semi-final again or if we will ever have the chance again to go to the final, you never know. We have an exceptional team here and nothing is for granted. You need luck in moments and all these sorts of things, so you better treat it carefully and be ready, and we will be ready. How likely is Liverpool Quadruple?

Klopp is adamant Liverpool are prepared for such an examination in order to progress through their Champions League semi-final and reach the third final of his tenure on Merseyside. ""We have to be ready to suffer,"" Klopp added. ""Not being a goal down - which can happen - but giving the game the right direction. ""A good example was Newcastle. The crowd was very passionate but we didn't let it happen, which was the biggest quality for this game. It wasn't a show of football brilliance. Of course we could have scored more goals but how clear-cut the performance was incredible. ""Yes we have to be emotional, ready to play the best game ever, but knowing it will not happen in moments. Suffering doesn't mean you suffer for long, you suffer and then you react."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Klopp added: ""Maturity and experience are very important, but they are not the only decisive things. You can be old and know everything about football but unable to play anymore, so that cannot be useful. ""Everything what we are will be required tomorrow night, that's it. We have to be ready to play a top, top game because they will go for us. They will high press, they will try to play much more football than we allowed them in the first game. ""Unai will for sure try to adapt a few things to our style. It will be really interesting. Maturity will be important but it's not the only thing."" Villarreal manager Unai Emery admits his side need to play the perfect game if they are to shock Liverpool to reach the club's first Champions League final. The former Arsenal boss was reminded their opponents had lost just three of 56 matches in a quadruple-chasing season. ""I didn't want to hear those details but I did,"" he said. ""It is a difficult task but we are working on the game. We need to play a perfect game. ""We need to find our excellence in certain things and maybe achieve something no one has achieved, which is this kind of comeback. We will try to find some weak spots, something that no one has done this season."" There was some positive news for Emery with striker Gerard Moreno, who missed the first leg, back after injury, although they will be missing former Bournemouth winger Arnaut Danjuma who is ill. ""Gerard trained with the rest of the group today,"" said the Villarreal boss. ""I don't know to what extent he will be fit for contention. We will not take any risks."" Sky Sports' Gary Neville: ""I really enjoyed the Liverpool-Villarreal first leg. Villarreal were massive underdogs, defending so deep in the 4-4-2 system. I thought highly of Liverpool and their persistence. ""Liverpool were doing the right things. Liverpool are a team who can win in different ways. They can outbox you; they can go toe to toe with you, punch for punch and they can be patient. Liverpool have demonstrated that in the last few years, they can wait, they can pass it around, they don't get panicky. ""I remember that game where they lost the title under Brendan Rodgers- they didn't have the experience to handle a different type of opponent. When Chelsea held back that day, they got very frustrated. ""I think it was a really good performance from Liverpool in the first leg, it was really professional. They should win that game, no doubt. Liverpool certainly [will qualify] - and that doesn't mean I don't respect Villarreal."" Sky Sports' Gary Neville: ""Liverpool are seven games from a Quadruple - seven games from a quadruple. That is the closest I think that anybody will ever have been to a Quadruple. I might be wrong. Someone will probably prove me wrong, but I can't think of a time. ""If Liverpool were to do it that would be unprecedented. Unprecedented achievements. So they, along with Manchester City, are on the brink of greatness.""

Everton are 18th in the Premier League table, just two points behind Leeds and Burnley outside of the relegation zone with a game in hand on both. Burnley enjoyed a hard-earned 2-1 comeback victory over Watford on Saturday, meaning the pressure was on for Frank Lampard and the Toffees to get a result. Richarlison's second-half goal at a raucous Goodison Park gave them victory, but speaking on Monday Night Football, Keane said some of the delays in play, prompted by Everton, left a sour taste. Keane said: ""Every time there was an injury, they were staying down for ages. Pickford made some great saves, but his time-wasting was disgraceful. ""But I totally get it. They must win a game of football. I think where Everton are, you're fighting for your lives, fighting for survival, for Frank, the players and for the supporters yesterday."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Everton have only won two out of their last six games - the other coming in a 1-0 victory against Manchester United, also at Goodison Park. Keane suggested the home atmosphere may have a big part to play in Everton's bid for survival. He said: ""The atmosphere, it was electric. Before the game, I thought Everton were in big trouble, but after being at Goodison, I'm thinking that Everton will stay up.

""Their total focus is on just defending, when it goes back to the keeper, they can go up the pitch and they can enjoy defending, but not worry about the other side of it."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking to Monday Night Football, Jamie Carragher praised Everton's direct approach in their last two games - particularly in their victory against Chelsea Carragher said: ""What's really jumped at me was how direct Everton were in those two games. Just look at Jordan Pickford's pass map. He's had the ball 44 times and he's gone long every single time. ""Now that is a complete change for Frank Lampard in terms of his philosophy and how he's gone about things at Everton. Now, the interesting thing for me is: will that continue? ""What they did - and I have said it a lot doing this show for seven or eight years, Everton football. I've known that ever since I was a kid. But Goodison Park, going long, getting on second balls and being aggressive. ""Not too worried about playing through the lines, they are going to make it horrible and they are going to make it difficult."" He added: ""It's not pressing mad. A lot of the time it's just that mid-block there... and when they were in the position to press, they pressed! Richarlison did brilliantly and it was a great finish.""

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/12599944/premier-league-clubs-best-and-worst-possible-final-positions-in-table,Premier League clubs' best and worst possible final positions in table,"Manchester City and Liverpool are locked in a two-horse race for the Premier League title - but how high or low could your club finish this season? Clubs have between two and five games left to seal their fate but 19 out of 20 clubs are still challenging for the title, qualification for the Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League, or to avoid the drop. Data guru Ben Mayhew has calculated each club's range of possible final league positions and found only Norwich have nothing to play for besides pride during the remainder of this season. Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United are all in the hunt to join title-tussling Manchester City and Liverpool in the top four - with Spurs and United potentially slipping as low as eighth to miss out on Europe next season altogether. With seventh spot being the lowest position to potentially offer a European berth, if permutations play out across competitions, it means all teams from fifth to 13th-placed Aston Villa retain the potential to qualify for Europe. Norwich were relegated on Saturday after a 2-0 defeat to Villa and results conspired against them elsewhere, but, theoretically, every single team sitting above the Canaries up to ninth-placed Brighton could finish in the drop zone. Watford have been widely written off in the survival race but the Hornets could still finish in 16th, while the attention for that final relegation spot centres on Everton, Leeds and Burnley - but all three could still secure a top-half finish. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Premier League fixtures Mayhew has also simulated every possible result from the remaining games and calculated the probabilities of each club's possible final positions. The results suggest Manchester City have a 69-per-cent chance of retaining their Premier League crown, while Liverpool have almost the same chance of finishing as runners-up. Chelsea are nailed down for third spot at 93 per cent, with Arsenal pipping Tottenham to the final Champions League berth at 74 per cent - while Manchester United have a whopping 94-per-cent-chance of finishing in their current sixth spot. Each club’s attacking and defensive strength have been rated using an expected goals model, which measures the quality of chances they create and allow.  These ratings were then used to simulate the rest of the season 10,000 times to measure the probability of each club finishing in each league position. Further down the table - between Brighton and Southampton - things become far less predictable, with fairly even spreads between ninth and 15th. The probabilities consign Watford to the Championship but the pressure ramps up for the final drop spot, with Leeds favourites to finish in 18th (46 per cent), followed by Everton (31 per cent) and Burnley (23 per cent).

It was a bad weekend for Leeds in particular as Everton and Burnley both boosted their survival chances with significant wins over Chelsea and Watford respectively. Burnley and Leeds, with an inferior goal difference, are now only two points away and Everton, who are still in the drop zone, have a match in hand - at home to Crystal Palace three days before the final day of the season - so their destiny remains in their hands.

""I have to say that performance level against Man City, even thought they lost 4-0, was very different from the performances we've seen this season where they've been battered 4-0, 5-0 and 6-0, and we thought what the hell was that.

""The Leeds crowd responded to the performance against City. They knew their side put a real shift in and it wasn't chaotic as we'd seen previously, where they just looked like a mess. ""They were organised, they were decent, and they didn't get that luck. They were a bit frantic in the final third and they've got to stop conceding goals from defensive set pieces. ""Losing Liam Cooper and Stuart Dallas is a problem there. It's been the story of their season. ""They do things that teams go down do. They concede goals from set pieces, they are frantic in the final third and they do lack composure, but I do think if they can put four performances in like the one against Man City, it keeps them up.""

With Watford being virtually down, you'd imagine Everton will have the edge there. Leicester, are they still going to be in Europe? That's another question by the time that fixture comes up.

""They've been a different team when they've played at home, but can they now change that mindset away? If they can, then they'll stay in the Premier League. If they can't, then they'll go down.

We were all shocked because maybe we are not as close to the situation internally at Burnley. ""Burnley fans were respectful of the job Sean Dyche had done.

How Premier League could have nine teams in European competitions next season,"The race for Europe is on but which teams make it - and how many - is still to be decided. With the Premier League campaign reaching its climax, we look at: There are seven European spots open to English sides - although that number could rise to nine and the amount of teams in each individual competition can shift. As a basis: However, because this season the FA Cup winner will be either Liverpool or Chelsea, and both those teams look set to finish in the top four, their Europa League qualifying spot for winning the FA Cup will be passed down to the next highest Premier League finisher who doesn't qualify for Europe. Similarly, because Liverpool won the Carabao Cup and are set to finish in the top four, their Europa Conference League qualifying spot from that competition will go to the next highest Premier League finisher without European football. So that means sides which finish sixth and seventh in the Premier League table are in contention for a place in either the Europa League or Europa Conference League next season. Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal would qualify for the Champions League by finishing in the Premier League's top four positions. Tottenham would go into the Europa League, along with Manchester United (who would get in thanks to Chelsea or Liverpool passing on their spot from winning the FA Cup). Seventh-placed West Ham would qualify for the Europa Conference League, thanks to Liverpool's Carabao Cup winner's spot being passed on. Manchester City and Liverpool have pulled clear at the top of the Premier League, and while their battle to win the Premier League title continues, they don't have to worry about Champions League qualification. Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp will still be plotting how to win this year's competition, and could meet in the final, but they already have their places in next season's tournament wrapped up through the league. Meanwhile, the last two spots in the top four are still up for grabs with Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham in contention with four games remaining. However, whatever the outcome, it will be a top-six finish at the very least for Chelsea and Arsenal, who return to European competition after missing out last season. Although not mathematically done yet, Spurs have all but guaranteed a Europa League spot with a nine-point gap between them and seventh-placed West Ham, who have just three matches left to play this season. Antonio Conte's side also have a far superior goal difference to the Hammers. The battle for the final Europa League spot continues between Man Utd and West Ham, while Wolves also have their eyes on finishing seventh and potentially securing a place in the Europa Conference League. If Manchester City or Liverpool win the Champions League they will automatically qualify for the competition's group stages next season. That is irrespective of where they finish in the Premier League table. If they qualify for the competition through two methods - ie: they win it and finish in the top four - there is no extra Champions League spot created for another team to fill and the number of Premier League clubs in next season's Champions League will remain at four. The Premier League could have a maximum of five teams in the Champions League next season, though, if West Ham won the Europa League and finished outside the top four. Winning that competition qualifies them for the Champions League group stages. If Leicester win the Europa Conference League they will automatically qualify for next season's Europa League - another additional European spot. That means, if West Ham and Leicester win their competitions and finish outside the Premier League's top seven there will be nine English sides in European competition next season. The nine sides would be: the top four and West Ham in the Champions League, fifth and sixth place, plus Leicester, in the Europa League, and seventh place in the Europa Conference League. But if Leicester were to win the Europa Conference League and finish seventh - the place set to be rewarded with a Europa Conference League spot - there would be no English side in the Europa Conference League next season, as Leicester would be bumped up to the Europa League. That happened in Spain last season with Sevilla and no La Liga side involved in the Europa Conference League. With Liverpool and Manchester City in the Champions League semi-finals, there's a good chance an English side would win the tournament - but that would have no impact on European qualification, with both sides set to finish in the top four. West Ham are into the semis of the Europa League and an additional Champions League spot is up for grabs if they win that competition. Their Europa Conference League spot for finishing seventh would disappear.Leicester - 10 points off seventh with two games in hand - could be playing European football again next year if they progress from their semi-final and win the Europa Conference League to earn an additional spot in the Europa League. Regardless of any permutation, no side finishing eighth in the Premier League will qualify for Europe, unless they've won a domestic or European cup. Eighth-placed Wolves would be the highest-finishing Premier League team to miss out on European football, although they are just three points behind West Ham and five off Manchester United, with a game in hand on both.

Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp's sides look destined to remain almost neck-and-neck until the very end of the Premier League season for the second time in four years with both sides victorious on Saturday, to leave City a point ahead in the standings with four games remaining. Both sides rested players due to their Champions League semi-final commitments but after a Mo Salah-less Liverpool edged to a 1-0 win at Newcastle in the lunchtime kick-off, Manchester City saw off a Leeds side unbeaten in five games with a 4-0 victory at Elland Road to leapfrog them back to the top of the table, despite making five changes from their match with Real Madrid in midweek. Neville told the Gary Neville Podcast the two teams had transformed the title race from the ""fights"" of his time as a player at Manchester United into a spectacle both appear to enjoy, with the increasing pressure of keeping up with their title rival never showing - and the prospect of a faultless end to the season a real possibility. He said: ""The thing that actually City have done tonight, which is massively impressive, but they make it look easy, is that when we were up against the team going for a title and they played before us, we always wanted to play first. ""When Liverpool have gone and done what they did at lunchtime today at Newcastle, after Villarreal in midweek and all the games they've had recently, you're thinking that switches the pressure to City, but you never really get the impression that these two teams feel that pressure.

""What Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola are doing today is, they're basically empowering the squad,"" said Neville. ""You hear managers say 'I've got a great squad', but have you got the guts and the courage to really use that squad in big matches where you need to win?

Garcia's goal sent Liverpool through to the 2005 Champions League final in Istanbul, where they would come from three goals down to beat AC Milan on penalties in one of the greatest games in history. Liverpool could book their place in yet another Champions League final this evening if they beat Villarreal in the second leg of their semi-final tie, with Jurgen Klopp's side holding a 2-0 lead from the first leg at Anfield. Loadingâ¦ Back in 2005, it was Chelsea who were Liverpool's opponents in the last four of the competition. The first leg at Stamford Bridge had ended in a goalless draw to leave the tie delicately poised heading into the second leg at Anfield. And it burst into life just four minutes into the reverse fixture on Merseyside. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard played a chipped through-ball over the top of the Chelsea defence, which striker Milan Baros attempted to reach before Blues goalkeeper Petr Cech. Baros managed to get a touch on the ball before being brought down by Cech in front of the Kop. #OnThisDay in 2005, @luchogarcia14 sent us to Istanbul ð pic.twitter.com/eBNbIm4fPN As the home fans pleaded for a penalty and a red card, Garcia latched onto the loose ball and directed a shot towards goal which deflected off Chelsea captain John Terry. William Gallas raced back towards goal to make a desperate clearance on the line as Garcia wheeled away in celebration. After a few moments of confusion, the Slovakian referee Lubos Michel signalled that the goal had been given, sending Anfield into a state of euphoria. Rafael Benitez's side would go on to grind out a 1-0 aggregate win to book their place in the final in Istanbul. The goal remains hugely controversial to this day, with Chelsea and Liverpool fans in disagreement over whether the ball crossed the line. Chelsea's manager that day, Jose Mourinho, dubbed it the ""ghost goal"" after the match and insisted it should not have been given. ""It was a goal that came from the moon â from the Anfield stands,"" Mourinho said at the time. ""I felt the power of Anfield, it was magnificent. I felt it didn't interfere with my players but maybe it interfered with other people and maybe it interfered with the result."" A post shared by Luis Garcia (@luchogarcia14) Mourinho doubled down on those claims in 2019, telling beIN Sports: ""Anfield is a magic place to play, it is a beautiful place to play. ""They can even score goals that the players don't score, like it happened in 2005. ""It wasn't Garcia that scored the goal, it was the crowd that scored the goal, but now it isnât possible with VAR and goal-line technology."" Should the goal have been given?

Who knew? Ralf Rangnick gave the Spanish playmaker his first Premier League start for Manchester United on Monday night in their clash against Brentford â and they looked a better side with him on the pitch as they recorded a comfortable 3-0 win. It was a night of firsts. United made over 400 passes in the first half of a Premier League game for the first time this season against Thomas Frank's side; an improvement on a host of poor performances in recent months. And top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo linked up wonderfully with Mata, who appeared to say his final farewell to fans at Old Trafford after an eight-year spell with the club. The Mata-Ronaldo show. pic.twitter.com/MCq3eLxJLi The 34-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and although he has yet to confirm his plans regarding his future, it appears the former Spain international will leave after waving to all corners of the stadium on Monday night. It has been a journey of mixed feelings for former Valencia and Chelsea attacking midfielder Mata. He's made a total of 283 appearances for United since being brought in by David Moyes for Â£37.1 million in 2014, but he has struggled for first-team minutes in recent years, despite showing glimpses of brilliance. Despite a lack of opportunitues at United, the experienced playmaker has always maintained his class off the pitch. After the full-time whistle on Monday night, he stayed behind at Old Trafford to sign autographs and take pictures with fans in the pouring rain. In fact, pictures of Mata meeting fans emerged on social media at 11:45pm and beyond. Juan Mata spent several minutes in the rain posing for photos & signing autographs.

According to a report from The Daily Mail, he helps unload the dirty laundry after games, as well as cleaning up the boots and other clothing. A source at the club spoke about his contributions off the pitch. ""Juan is a special guy, he has started to help the kit man and his staff over the last couple of months."" he said. ""It sums up what kind of person he is. While his team-mates just jump into their flashy motors and zoom off after being dropped off back after away games, Juan has taken it on himself to stay behind and give a helping hand to the ordinary staff. ""It's a huge job to unload all the gear off the coach and takes a good while. ""People have been saying what a great gesture it is but to be honest it's just typical of the man - we are saying he has to be the nicest man in football."" Manchester United manager Ralf Rangnick labelled Mata as a ""magician"" after the 3-0 win against Brentford. When asked if he could have used Mata more often throughout the campaign, the interim boss said: ""Yes, maybe it was the first game he played from the beginning, [but it] also had to do with the opposition in this position and in the last couple of weeks he was one of the players who showed in training how professional he is and how much he loves the game. He had moments when he played like a magician."" Do you think United should have used Mata more? Let us know in the comments. ",positive,chelsea

https://www.sportbible.com/football/six-years-ago-today-jamie-vardy-hosted-leicesters-title-winning-party-20220502,Six Years Ago Today Jamie Vardy Hosted The Ultimate Title Winning Party,"On this day in 2016, Leicester City players gathered at Jamie Vardy's house to see if they would complete an incredible Premier League title race. Loadingâ¦ Six years ago, Leicester were on the verge of the most incredible league winning campaign in the history of the Premier League's history. Having narrowly avoided relegation the previous season, the club had appointed Claudio Ranieri in the summer and the team went on an incredible run to make the impossible suddenly seem possible. On May 2nd title chasers Tottenham Hotspur, themselves trying to win a first league title since 1961, travelled to champions Chelsea in a must win game. The Blues were having a dreadful season but knew that stopping London rivals Spurs picking up all three points would result in Leicester being crowned champions. Whilst things were about to heat up in London, the Foxes' players gathered at Vardy's house to watch the game, as life imitated art, with the fan's ""Jamie Vardy's having a party"" chant came to life. The game at Stamford Bridge would become to be known as the 'Battle of the Bridge,' but it started in relatively basic circumstances for that campaign. Harry Kane scored his 25th goal of the league season, and when Son Heung-min doubled the lead before half time it looked like the champagne would have to be put on ice, as Spurs eyed their first win away to the Blues since 1990. A challenge by Danny Rose on Willian sparked angry scenes, with Mauricio Pochettino entering the pitch to split the two men, before Moussa Dembele gouged Diego Costa's eyes in the melee. Spurs were lucky Rose wasn't sent off for the challenge but then at half time momentum shifted as Eden Hazard was brought on as a substitute. Chelsea got on top with the introduction of the Belgian, despite his poor season to that date, but it was Gary Cahill who scored their first goal. Hazard grabbed the equaliser with seven minutes to go and things got uglier with challenges flying in from the visitors, inspired by the Chelsea players who had said they wanted to get one over their rivals and help Leicester, in the build up to the match. When the full time whistle blew it ended Spurs' slim hopes of winning the league and sparked incredible scenes at Vardy's house party. This will never ever grow old ð¬#OnThisDay in 2016, the Foxes squad assembled.You know what happened next... ð¦ ð ð pic.twitter.com/KNv1V1hkvK Ranieri's side then faced Everton five days later at the King Power Stadium, where the fans were able to join their heroes in celebrating the title.

It wasn't Spurs who they beat however, with Pochettino's side losing 5-1 to relegated Newcastle United on the final day and slipping behind Arsenal into third. Though it was the Battle of the Bridge that ended up giving Leicester their incredible title, that night it was all about the scenes at the Vardy residence.

Fans reacted to the incident and they aren't entirely sure what went on. One commented: ""It's very rare Dec loses his s**t like this but you can see why he did today."" Another said: ""Tbh I like his frustration. Would kill for Rice in our midfield."" A third put: ""Proud of Nketiah stood up hands down to show no intention of fighting."" While someone tweeted: ""Iâm not quite sure why Rice wasnât given a yellow for this!?!""

Shortly after the break, Gabriel joined centre back partner Holding on the scoresheet with a header of his own. Mikel Arteta's side held on and leapfrogged Tottenham Hotspur in the table with four games remaining.

Burnley's back-to-back wins had left Everton five points from safety and looking like a first relegation since 1951, and with games running out it was becoming a major worry. Richarlison put his side 1-0 up just a minute after the second half begun, pouncing on Cesar Azpilicueta's mistake and slotting past Edouard Mendy, to rapturous scenes from the home supporters. Flares were thrown onto the pitch by the fans, with the forward picking one up and lobbing it back towards the stands, with the FA opening an investigation.

""We will look into the matter,"" the club said. ""As far we we are concerned, Richarlison was attempting to throw it out of the ground."" The club and the FA will both investigate the issue, with the FA having previously written to Liverpool's Harvey Elliott earlier this season when he handled a flare. That came in the Carabao Cup final win on penalties, also against Chelsea, with the 19-year-old picking up the flare before putting it back down again. In 2009 Didier Drogba was cautioned by the police after throwing a coin back into the crowd, after a Burnley fan had thrown it in his direction whilst he was celebrating a goal against the Clarets. As well as Richarlison's goal, Lampard and Everton were grateful for Jordan Pickford's brilliant performance in goal, somehow saving from Azpilicueta's shot, after the initial chance had left the goalkeeper on the other side of the goal. The Merseyside team are now just two points below both Leeds and Burnley, with the former dropping below the Clarets after recent results. They have a game in hand and next travel to Leicester City and then Watford, although they have not won an away game in the league since August. ",positive,chelsea

Bergwijn arrived at the club as a 22-year-old from PSV Eindhoven for a £27m fee in the January window two years ago, but he has struggled to nail down a regular spot in the first XI. A dream Premier League debut saw Bergwijn net in a 2-0 victory at home to Manchester City, while he has appeared on 29 occasions in all competitions during the 2021-22 season. However, Bergwijn has only managed to register four goals and two assists in that spell, with both of his Premier League strikes coming in that dramatic late victory at Leicester City back in January. Bergwijn's heroics in that game have not led to better fortunes for the 24-year-old, though, and he has only made the first XI in four top-flight games this term. © Reuters As a result, Bergwijn is being strongly linked with an exit from Antonio Conte's side in the upcoming summer window as he pushes for a place in the Netherlands squad at the 2022 World Cup. With Bergwijn's compatriot Erik ten Hag taking over at Manchester United in the summer, the Red Devils are supposedly interested in bringing the Dutchman to Old Trafford as part of their attacking shake-up. The former PSV man has now admitted that a transfer away from Spurs is the likeliest option at the end of the season, telling Dutch outlet AD: ""A starting place here? I honestly don't think so. ""It's a difficult story for me. It's good up front, but I don't play much. There are still four games to go. After that, we will see in the summer what is best for both parties.

Qualification for the Champions League would help to boost Arsenal's coffers, and Arteta's side currently sit two points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur in the table before Sunday's fixtures commence. A plethora of attacking targets have already been mooted after Arsenal missed out on the signature of Dusan Vlahovic in January, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Gabriel Jesus and Darwin Nunez all mentioned. Arsenal have supposedly already agreed to sign Manchester City's Jesus in a £42m deal, but Arteta has warned Gooners not to expect his side to fork out mammoth fees on one player like Liverpool did for Alisson Becker and Virgil van Dijk. ""I don't think we are in a position where we can do that, so we have to find other ways to do it,"" Arteta told Sky Sports News when questioned on Liverpool's big-money defensive signings. © Reuters ""Liverpool, as well, have improved their players immensely, which is as important as bringing players in. And then, the ones that you buy, [it's important] that they can have an impact straight away. ""That's a big decision they have to make in recruitment, and then they are human beings as well. They have to adapt, and sometimes that's a tricky question to answer before they are actually here. ""We want to make the squad stronger, we want to make the starting XI stronger, we want to make the specificity and the personality of our players stronger, and that's what we are going to be seeking to do. ""It will depend on many factors - how many players are back from their loans, with the commitments we still have with them; our financial position in relation to where we finish; the clubs' demands when we want to buy players or sell players. There are a lot of question marks there, but this is football."" A new central midfielder could also be on the agenda for Arsenal with Mohamed Elneny now less than two months away from becoming a free agent, but the Egypt international has impressed with showings against Chelsea and Manchester United in the past couple of weeks. © Reuters Elneny has confirmed his desire to sign a new contract at Arsenal, even if he remains a bit-part player under Arteta, who has also admitted that the ex-Basel man does not always get the credit he feels he deserves. Kieran Tierney's long-term injury and Nuno Tavares's hit-and-miss campaign could also lead Arsenal to move for a new left-back in the summer market, and Bologna's Aaron Hickey is also thought to be on their wanted list. However, the Scottish teenager - who supposedly possesses a €20m (£16.7m) price tag - is also rumoured to have attracted interest from Italian heavyweights Juventus, AC Milan and Napoli ahead of the summer window. Matteo Guendouzi, Lucas Torreira, Hector Bellerin, Konstantinos Mavropanos and Pablo Mari could also head elsewhere following the completion of their loan deals, but William Saliba is understood to have decided against a permanent move to Marseille as he fights for his spot in the defence alongside Ben White and Gabriel Magalhaes. Arsenal could temporarily drop out of the top four if Tottenham get the better of Leicester City on Sunday but will attempt to usurp their North London rivals when they meet West Ham United later in the day.

One of Britain’s richest men launched a last-minute move for the club on Friday, throwing fresh uncertainty over a process that is finally nearing completion. US merchant bank Raine Group were in the process of confirming to the three shortlisted contenders who would be submitted to the Treasury as the successful candidate when Ratcliffe’s £4.25billion offer was revealed. While Boehly is now in a five-day period of exclusive negotiations, Ratcliffe’s bid remains on the table and is still seen by sources close to the process as a viable option. As a result Raine are still to publicly confirm Boehly as their choice to buy out Roman Abramovich. It is believed that an increased offer from Ratcliffe - owner of INEOS - could be enough to blow the process wide open. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has made a last-ditch attempt to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich (Martin Rickett/PA) It is thought he bypassed Raine in making his offer, thus avoiding the complex bidding process set up by the bank. Steve Pagliuca and Sir Martin Broughton were informed on Friday afternoon that their bids had been unsuccessful. Boehly had been the outstanding favourite from the moment the Ricketts family pulled out on the eve of final offers being made. His plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge were among the strongest points of his bid, while he also had the advantage of already carrying out due diligence when previously trying to buy the club. Ratcliffe was also a former suitor and his dramatic insertion into the process could yet have an impact. He has not been told his bid is too late. While Boehly has the chance push through his buyout, the threat of Ratcliffe will leave him aware that there can be no hitches for fear of seeing his rival steal in. In a statement, INEOS said: “This is a British bid, for a British club. We believe that a club is bigger than its owners who are temporary custodians of a great tradition. With responsibility to the fans and the community. “That is why we are committing to spending £1.75bn over 10 years that will be for the direct benefit of the club. We will invest in Stamford Bridge to make it a world-class stadium, befitting of Chelsea FC. This will be organic and on-going so that we will not move away from the home of Chelsea and risk losing the support of loyal fans. “We believe that London should have a club that reflects the stature of the city. One that is held in the same regard as Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich. We intend Chelsea to be that club.” ",positive,chelsea
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-fc-romelu-lukaku-transfer-news-ac-milan-newcastle-b997605.html,Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku to reject AC Milan and Newcastle interest but Thomas Tuchel frustration growing,"omelu Lukaku will reject any interest from AC Milan this summer, placing fresh uncertainty over his future. The Chelsea striker also has no interest in Newcastle, one of the few teams seen as being able to afford his salary and transfer fee. The Belgium international’s position at Stamford Bridge is under intense scrutiny after being consigned to the fringes by Thomas Tuchel in recent months. He has made only one Premier League start since late February and was an unused substitute in Chelsea’s 1-0 defeat to Everton on Sunday. Lukaku has endured a miserable return to Chelsea after his club-record £97.5million move from Inter Milan last summer. He has struggled to adapt to Tuchel’s system, while injuries have also disrupted his campaign. Meanwhile, his relationship with his manager was strained by his decision to conduct an interview with Italian TV, in which he was critical of Tuchel’s system. While Chelsea’s head coach insisted the situation was resolved, Lukaku has largely been reduced to the role of substitute during the second half of the season. The player is growing increasingly frustrated by his lack of opportunities, with Tuchel’s decision not to use him at Goodison Park - despite being in desperate search of a goal - surprising sources close to Lukaku. It has been noted that he remains Chelsea’s joint second-highest goalscorer this season, despite his lack of starts and injury problems. Tuchel has publicly stated that it is down to Lukaku to prove he can lead his attack and live up to the expectations that accompanied his return to the club. But the German continues to select Kai Havertz ahead of him as a makeshift striker. That raises serious questions about Lukaku’s future, with major doubts over whether he can convince Tuchel to build his attack around him. Milan have emerged as a potential escape route but Lukaku would be reluctant to further upset Inter fans, who he made such an effort to appease with his ill-judged Sky Italia interview. Chelsea know there are few clubs who would be willing to offer them anything like the money they paid for Lukaku, which could block any chance of him moving on this summer. His wages, believed to be around £300,000-a-week, would rule out the vast majority of possible suitors. Romelu Lukaku has only made one Premier League start since February as his Chelsea struggles continue Newly-rich Newcastle were widely seen as one of the few clubs that would not be put off by the financial package required, even though it is unclear if they have any interest. But it is understood Lukaku would not entertain a move to St James’ Park. It remains to be seen what approach Chelsea’s new owners take with the former Manchester United player. While Roman Abramovich has largely been prepared to write off big-money signings, his successor may not. Todd Boehly, who is in exclusive talks to buy the club, has made it clear that he sees sports teams as investment opportunities. It is unlikely he would be comfortable with the most expensive player in the club’s history sitting on the bench. But the American is also believed to want Tuchel at the heart of his Chelsea revolution, which could mean more misery for Lukaku, whose preference is to stay and turn his fortunes around at the club he supported as a boy.

The quadruple-chasing Reds travel to eastern Spain holding a commanding 2-0 lead in their last-four tie after a Pervis Estupinan own goal and Sadio Mane’s second-half effort in a one-sided first leg at Anfield last week. However, manager Jurgen Klopp is not taking anything for granted on the road to Paris, insisting it is a difficult scoreline as Unai Emery pledged to make his side “suffer” in Tuesday’s return clash. Liverpool followed up that dominant win over Villarreal in which they held 73 per cent of the overall possession and allowed only one shot (which was off-target) by triumphing at Newcastle on Saturday, with Naby Keita’s fourth goal of the season in the early Premier League kick-off ensuring they piled the pressure on title rivals Manchester City, who responded with a routine 3-0 victory at Leeds later in the day to regain top spot with four games to go. Much-changed Villarreal, meanwhile, slumped to a disappointing 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Alaves at the weekend, leaving them seventh in LaLiga, four points adrift of the top six and nine behind Atletico Madrid in fourth. Their hopes of playing in Europe at all next season could well now rest on pulling off an incredible comeback against six-time champions Liverpool and winning the whole competition, with either Real Madrid or Manchester City awaiting the winners of this tie in the final at the Stade de France on May 28. Liverpool vs Villarreal is scheduled for an 8pm BST kick-off on Tuesday May 3, 2022. The match will take place at the Estadio de la Ceramica - better known as El Madrigal - in Villarreal, Spain.

Liverpool will remain without Roberto Firmino on Tuesday, though the Brazilian forward is now back running after nursing a foot issue and is set to travel to Spain with his team-mates. Divock Origi will be assessed after missing the win over Newcastle through non-Covid illness, though Curtis Jones and Kostas Tsimikas are available again. Klopp made five changes in total at St James’ Park, with Mohamed Salah, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ibrahima Konate all moving to the bench. That quintet should return to the starting lineup against Villarreal, though it’s a difficult juggling act with Tottenham visiting Anfield on Saturday evening and the FA Cup Final against Chelsea now less than two weeks away. Mo Salah will return to Liverpool’s starting XI against Villarreal after being rested at Newcastle Klopp is not expecting any players to miss out with a stomach bug that has been in camp of late. Villarreal boss Emery made eight changes of his own against Alaves, with only Samuel Chukwueze, Dani Parejo and Pau Torres retaining their starting berths from Anfield. Former Liverpool full-back Alberto Moreno remains sidelined with a long-term knee injury, but a major boost should come with the return of key striker Gerard Moreno, who sat out the first leg with a hamstring complaint. Raul Albiol and ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin have both shaken off knocks, though Arnaut Danjuma is now struggling with a foot problem after missing training on Monday. Predicted Villarreal XI: Rulli, Foyth, Albiol, Torres, Estupinan, Parejo, Capoue, Coquelin, Lo Celso, Chukwueze, Gerard Predicted Liverpool XI: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Konate, Robertson; Fabinho, Henderson, Thiago; Mane, Salah, Diaz Villarreal’s gameplan totally failed at Anfield, with no shots on target, barely any possession and next to no opportunities to hit on the break. Untroubled Liverpool were entirely comfortable and should unquestionably have won by more as they serenely controlled and dominated proceedings. The wily Emery will have to make big tactical changes for the second leg as they need to put Liverpool under far more pressure from the outset. However, their chances of breaching a mean defence that have now kept four successive clean sheets across all competitions appear slim. Villarreal need to push on and take the initiative in front of their own fans, which will inevitably leave plenty of space in behind for the likes of Salah, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz to exploit. Liverpool to win, 2-0. Villarreal’s only win over Liverpool to date came on home soil back in the first leg of the Europa League semi-finals in 2016, with an injury-time effort from Adrian Lopez. However, the Reds hit back with goals from Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana at Anfield, winning 3-0 to book their place in the Basel showpiece, which they lost to Emery’s Sevilla.

The Brazilian has travelled after resuming running but won’t play at the Estadio de la Ceramica, where Liverpool head holding a commanding two-goal lead courtesy of a dominant first-leg win at Anfield last week. “Bobby is now running, so it’s good,” Klopp said at his pre-match press conference on Monday. “A little strain here in the middle foot bone, so it’s very painful each step. “But he was running today again, will travel with us but will not be involved in the squad yet. But we hope sooner rather than later.” Divock Origi could return to the Liverpool squad in eastern Spain after sitting out Saturday’s 1-0 Premier League victory against Newcastle due to non-Covid illness.

Spurs face a daunting trip to quadruple-chasing Liverpool on Saturday evening before Arsenal host Leeds, who have been dragged into the thick of a three-way relegation fight. With a two-point lead over their bitter rivals, fourth-placed Arsenal will be the more comfortable of the two, and this weekend offers them a good chance to open up a five-point gap on Spurs and potentially a cushion going into the north London derby at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Thursday week. But this is merely a scrap for fourth place, quite different to the relentless nature of the title race between Liverpool and Manchester City. Neither Arsenal nor Spurs have shown enough consistency this season to suggest they are certain to win their three other fixtures, so there should be more twists to come. If Spurs have an X-factor, it is their world-class individuals. In head coach Antonio Conte, they have one of the game’s best, while Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester was made comfortable by the brilliance of Harry Kane, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski at one end and Cristian Romero at the other. Arsenal, by contrast, are lacking the same star quality but feel like a more rounded team under Mikel Arteta, further along in their rebuild than their neighbours. Last month, Brighton and Brentford offered a blueprint of how to nullify Conte’s Spurs — specifically, deny them space in the final third and stop Kane getting on the ball — and, in having a more clearly-defined system, Arsenal are harder to stop and better at breaking down stubborn opponents. Arteta is also getting more from his squad than Conte, and important performances from fringe players Mohamed Elneny, Eddie Nketiah and Rob Holding in the wins over Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham point to a united group, with deceptive depth. By contrast, Lucas Moura was hopelessly rusty on his first Spurs start since mid-February on Sunday, while Harry Winks was off the pace in a late cameo, hardly surprisingly given Conte has barely changed his XI for over two months. Both clubs have been impacted by injuries in the same positions, with Spurs losing midfielder Oliver Skipp and wing-back Matt Doherty, and Arsenal without Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney in similar positions. Mikel Arteta vs Antonio Conte - who will win the race for Champions League qualification? The absences may prove crucial in the run-in. In Nuno Tavares, who is deputising for Tierney at left wing-back, Arsenal have an agent of chaos, and while the Portuguese is in the team there is a chance they will drop points in any game. Kulusevski, who came off the bench to twice assist Son on Sunday, should have the beating of Tavares if they both start on May 12. For all their star quality up front, Spurs, though, are weak on both flanks. In the absence of Doherty and Sergio Reguilon, who is sidelined indefinitely with a groin injury, wing-backs Emerson Royal and Ryan Sessegnon failed to make an impact in the final third against Leicester. But it is long past the point where Conte is likely to change his system or experiment on the flanks. If Arsenal allow Spurs’ wing-backs to have the ball, and keep it away from their forwards, they will be in a strong position next week. Spurs finish the season against Burnley, who are likely to be fighting for survival, and already-relegated Norwich, while Arsenal face a tough trip to Newcastle and host Everton on the final day, when the Toffees may also be playing for their Premier League status. The derby will surely be crucial, but the fight for Champions League football could come down to Spurs’ individual brilliance against Arsenal’s collective cohesion and unity. Whatever happens in the next fortnight, expect the contest to go the wire. ",positive,chelsea

Arsenal are currently sat fourth in the Premier League table, two points ahead of Spurs in fifth with four games left to play this season. The rivals are set to go head to head a week on Thursday (May 12) in a match that is being billed as one of the biggest north London derbies in recent history. Holding admits the Arsenal squad are well aware that game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium will have a huge say on who qualifies for the Champions League, but the centre-back has also urged his team-mates not to allow it to distract them as Leeds visit the Emirates on Sunday. “We have got to take it a game at a time,” Holding told Standard Sport, when asked about the north London derby. “Obviously we have got Leeds at the weekend and that’s always an intense game. “They come and bring energy. It will be a tough game, but we are at home with the fans behind us and we can try to chalk up another three points. Rob Holding has warned Arsenal not to look past Leeds with a crucial north London derby looming “Then the following week on the Thursday we have Tottenham, so that’s what it’ll come down to and it should be a good game.” Arsenal and Tottenham have been neck and neck in the top-four race, and they momentarily swapped places on Sunday after Spurs beat Leicester in the early kick-off. The Gunners responded by defeating West Ham and have now won three games on the spin after initially losing the same number of matches at the start of April. Those wins have come against Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham, with Holding partly putting the turnaround down to Arsenal supporters sticking by the team during a difficult spell. “I think since Mikel [Arteta] has come in there has been a big change in mentality and connecting with the fans,” he said. “I think on Sunday the fans were amazing again and they have been for the last couple of weeks, in terms of away games and at home. “That’s why our results have been decent since those three that we lost. We bounced back and they stuck by us. It could have been an easy point to turn on us, but they stuck by us and we’ve had three good results now.” ",negative,chelsea

Mr Johnson is said to want the money to go towards a foundation that will help Ukraine recover from the Russian invasion but there are concerns about the practicalities of setting one up so quickly with such a large budget. Former Arsenal co-owner David Dein has written to the minister for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Nadine Dorries, to urge that £750million is put aside for the game. He wants ministers to use the money to help to build more than 1,000 artificial pitches, improve 20,000 playing surfaces and invest in changing rooms. Dein wrote: “While, to date, the focus has been on the buyers, there is a crucial question of where the proceeds from the sale go.

Last week’s tussle between the respective champions of England and Spain at the Etihad was an instant classic, with early goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus seeing the hosts race into a 2-0 lead inside 11 minutes. City could and should have scored a hatful more before the evergreen Ballon d’Or front-runner Karim Benzema reduced the deficit in trademark fashion, with second-half goals from Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva then sandwiched between a sensational Vinicius Junior effort and followed by an outrageous Benzema Panenka penalty that left a thrilling tie brilliantly poised at 4-3.

City look set to remain without experienced right-back Kyle Walker, who may not play again this season due to an ankle injury suffered in the quarter-final second leg against Atletico Madrid. Defensive colleague John Stones will be assessed after remaining sidelined for the win over Leeds, having limped off last week against Madrid - starting at right-back - in the first half. Guardiola made five changes to his first XI at Elland Road, with Stones, Oleksandr Zinchenko, De Bruyne, Bernardo and Riyad Mahrez replaced by Joao Cancelo, Nathan Ake, Ilkay Gundogan, Jack Grealish and Raheem Sterling. For Madrid, David Alaba is once again facing a race against time to be fit after recovering from a hamstring injury to start in the first leg, only to suffer a setback and go off at half-time. Casemiro is now fully fit, but Eden Hazard remains out as he recovers from an ankle operation and Gareth Bale missed the weekend’s title celebrations with back spasms. Based on the first leg, which was more akin to a basketball match, predicting an exact scoreline between these two attacking powerhouses is a fool’s errand. Last week’s contest was absorbing, chaotic and gloriously eventful, with seven goals scored when in reality it could and should have been well into double figures. City will be kicking themselves that they couldn’t get the job done last week despite their hatfuls of chances, with Real always managing to somehow hang on and prevail in the end. This truly could go either way, but we’re backing Guardiola’s men to narrowly progess in another high-octane affair and book a second consecutive final berth. Man City to win, 3-2.

The Blues slumped to a dismal 1-0 defeat by relegation battlers managed by Frank Lampard at Goodison Park on Sunday after captain Cesar Azpilicueta inexplicably lost the ball to Richarlison, who promptly slotted home what proved to be the winning goal just after half-time. Chelsea were then thwarted by a combination of their own profligacy, the woodwork and an outstanding display from England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford as Everton picked up a vital three points in their fight against relegation from the Premier League and their opponents were left to rue another self-inflicted disappointment. Manager Thomas Tuchel lamented his side’s sudden penchant for critical mistakes, which also cost them against Arsenal last week and in their agonising Champions League quarter-final defeat by Real Madrid. Loftus-Cheek was one of the few Chelsea players to come out of the defeat on Merseyside with any credit, denied a goal by the excellent Pickford and trying to drive his team forward whenever possible on his 50th start for the club. Ruben Loftus-Cheek was one of Chelsea’s few bright lights in their dismal defeat at Everton “We’re all very disappointed,” the 26-year-old told Chelsea’s official website. “Coming into the game we knew it was going to be a hostile atmosphere and it’d be like a final to them. We felt that straight away. “They came out of the blocks second half and caught us napping. We were fighting an uphill battle from then on, the fans were behind them, and it was hard to break them down. It was disappointing. “We’ve made a few mistakes over the past few matches and haven’t kept clean sheets from individual errors. That is how football is, if you keep shooting yourselves in the foot it will be difficult to get out of it.” Chelsea will be desperate to iron out those blunders before they face in-form Liverpool in a domestic cup final for the second time this season at Wembley on May 14. A third defeat in six Premier League games has also loosened their grip further on third place, with resurgent Arsenal now just three points behind and Tottenham five adrift of Chelsea with four matches left to play this term. Asked how Tuchel’s side could go about eradicating those repeated errors, Loftus-Cheek added: “It’s up to us as individuals to tune in and sharpen up as a team together. Getting everyone ready for the game, these are basics in football. “If you don’t have these basics, you will struggle like we have the last four games. This is not Chelsea standard at all. Our concentration levels were not good enough. “We want top four but we cannot perform like that with other teams doing well around us. We need wins. It is hard to process it right now and we will look back at it once the emotions have calmed down. “We had chances to score numerous times. Their keeper made some great saves. If we put them in, I think we could be coming away with a win.” ",positive,chelsea
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/karen-bardsley-retires-england-man-city-goalkeeper-b997480.html,Karen Bardsley: England and Manchester City goalkeeper announces she will retire this summer,"ngland Women and Manchester City goalkeeper Karen Bardsley has announced her decision to retire from professional football this summer. The influential Bardsley, who turns 38 in October, will call time on an impressive career spanning two decades at the end of the current Women’s Super League (WSL) campaign. “It was obviously a pretty tough decision for me to make but, after a lot of deliberation and unfortunately being away from the pitch for quite a while now due to injury, it just felt like it was the right moment,” she said on Monday. “As sad and strange as it is to be stepping away from something I’ve committed my entire young adult life to, ultimately it’s something I feel really proud of and I can honestly say, hand on heart, that I’ve left no stone unturned and I have no regrets about how I’ve applied myself and what I’ve achieved. “I feel incredibly proud of my career but ultimately I’m really excited about the next steps and what is to come in the future, and I’m just very much looking forward to giving back to the football community in many other ways.” SPONSORED The American-born Bardsley has 81 senior England caps to her name, featuring in three World Cups and two European Championships. She also played at London 2012 for Great Britain and was part of Hege Riise’s initial squad for last summer’s delayed Tokyo Olympics, though was forced to withdraw through injury. Bardsley, who played college soccer for the Cal State Fullerton Titans, began her club career in the United States, playing for Ajax America Women, Pali Blues and Sky Blue FC before moving to Europe with Swedish outfit Linköpings. She first arrived in English football with Lincoln in 2013, joining Manchester City a year later ahead of their debut season in the WSL. Bardsley won the WSL title with City in 2016, plus four League Cups and three FA Cups. With the Lionesses, the 37-year-old was a member of the squad that finished third at the 2015 World Cup in Canada, also lifting the Cyprus Cup twice and the SheBelieves Cup in the USA in 2019. Manchester United’s Mary Earps has now established herself as England’s first-choice goalkeeper under Sarina Wiegman ahead of this summer’s delayed home Euros, with competition from Bardsley’s City team-mate Ellie Roebuck and Aston Villa’s Hannah Hampton. City plan to honour Bardsley ahead of Wednesday’s clash with Birmingham, with a trip to Reading then in store before the FA Cup Final clash with Chelsea at Wembley on May 15. They currently sit fourth in the WSL, one point adrift of United in third and with a game in hand on their rivals. “Karen has left an undeniable mark on women’s football, and I believe that her playing career is just the start of the overall impact she will make,” said City head coach Gareth Taylor. “Although injury has limited her appearances on the pitch during my time in charge, she has remained an integral member of our team and has made a real difference behind the scenes. “She deserves all the plaudits that she receives, and I would like to wish her the very best for the future and the next step of her journey.” ",positive,chelsea
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-fc-romelu-lukaku-everton-thomas-tuchel-b997473.html,Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel reveals why Romelu Lukaku did not play at all in shock Everton defeat,"helsea manager Thomas Tuchel has opened up on his decision not to play Romelu Lukaku at all during Sunday’s shock defeat by Everton. The sluggish and weary Blues suffered their third loss in six Premier League games at Goodison Park, with Richarlison’s effort after a key Cesar Azpilicueta error handing Frank Lampard’s side a vital victory in their battle against relegation. It was a disappointing result punctuated by more sloppy individual mistakes and profligacy, both of which are becoming all-too-familiar themes for a Chelsea team that have certainly not been firing on all cylinders since their agonising Champions League quarter-final exit at the hands of Real Madrid last month. Lukaku’s struggles are a major running theme of an inconsistent campaign that has still included two domestic cup finals and Club World Cup glory, with the £97.5million club-record signing having started just one of the last nine matches across all competitions. Prolific in Inter Milan’s Serie A title-winning season last year, the Belgian international has failed to net a Premier League goal since December. Romelu Lukaku was an unused substitute as Chelsea slumped to a shock defeat at Everton Regardless of those ongoing issues, many fans may still have expected Tuchel to turn to Lukaku as his side tried in vain to snatch a late equaliser on Merseyside on Sunday, with third-place Chelsea now just three points ahead of Arsenal with four matches left to play this term. Instead, the German opted to replace Jorginho with midfield colleague Mateo Kovacic at the interval, with wide forwards Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic later introduced at the expense of captain Azpilicueta and ineffective frontman Timo Werner. When quizzed as to why Lukaku did not feature at all against former club Everton, Tuchel insisted he was merely restricted by the number of available substitutions, which will be increased to five per game from next season. He said: “Because we brought Jorginho off. We only had three changes.” ",negative,chelsea
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-rob-holding-mikel-arteta-mohamed-elneny-b997441.html,Arsenal: Unlikely heroes emerge as Mikel Arteta’s young side regain control of Champions League battle,"or much of Arsenal’s season their young players have been centre stage, but this recent revival has seen other unlikely protagonists step forward. After losing to Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton, few would have predicted Arsenal would then beat Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham in quick succession. Nor would many have called that the likes of Eddie Nketiah and Mohamed Elneny would be at the heart of those wins. Against West Ham, it was the turn of Rob Holding to emerge as an unlikely hero as he helped Arsenal battle to a 2-1 win. It was not a great performance from the Gunners and even manager Mikel Arteta described it as “ugly”, but they dug deep to grind out the result and no one embodied that gritty effort more than Holding. The centre-back has been on the periphery this season, playing second fiddle to Ben White and Gabriel and essentially taking on the role of defensive super-sub when Arsenal need to see out a game. ‘Smash glass here in case of emergency’, more or less. For this trip to West Ham, however, Holding was given the chance to start due to White being out injured with a tight hamstring. Holding seized his chance, opening the scoring with a header from a corner before throwing his body on the line as Arsenal held on to their slender lead. “The contribution that he (Holding) is having in terms of minutes is not very noticeable, but the contribution he has for the team is huge,” said Arteta. “He needs some praise. “He is someone like Mo [Elneny]. He is the same type of character, same type of person, that is just humble, just wants to give to the team and is happy with the success. When you ask him to play, he is always ready to do it.” It says a lot about the spirit at Arsenal that Holding and Elneny have barely played this season, but have come in and contributed at the most crucial time. Rob Holding and Mohamed Elneny remain crucial for Arsenal despite a lack of regular games Keeping players happy has not always been easy for Arteta but, even if this slimmed down squad has caused him problems, it has also allowed him to create a greater sense of unity. Holding has played his part in that and it is telling that he is a member of the leadership group, despite not being a regular starter. Off the pitch he has a strong influence in the dressing room and is valued by Arteta, acting as one of his trusted lieutenants. Having a strong first XI is naturally crucial to success, but the role of the squad cannot be overlooked and it has caused issues in the past at Arsenal. Holding’s goal and defensive efforts were pivotal in sealing an important win at West Ham The dressing room has not always been the happiest of places, however it is noticeable now how those on the sidelines seem fully on board, even if they only have limited chances to play. “It’s what it’s been like, Ben and Gabi have been great all year and when I’ve had to come on and try and help us secure the three points it’s vital for us, so to play the full 90 and get the three points is even better,” said Holding. Arsenal’s squad clearly needs strengthening and depth added, but, like last summer, making sure the right characters are signed will be key. In Holding, Arteta has someone who emphatically ticks that box. ",positive,chelsea

Pernille Harder coverted a late penalty to claim a hard-fought three points for Emma Hayes’ side, who sit four points ahead of rivals Arsenal, who have only one game in hand. Earlier on Sunday, Arsenal had romped to a 7-0 win over Aston Villa to ramp up the pressure. Vivianne Miedema scored twice with powerful shots in the opening 13 minutes to send Arsenal in at 2-0 up at the break, and an own goal by Rachel Corsie seven minutes into the second half saw Villa crumble. Beth Mead, Lotte Wubben-Moy and Stina Blackstenius all got on the scoresheet before Parris smacked home a 90th-minute penalty to reach a half-century of league goals in the English top flight as the Gunners climbed to 49 points, one behind Chelsea. Arsenal face Tottenham Hotspur, who play Everton later on Sunday, in midweek before finishing their league campaign away to West Ham, while Chelsea meet Birmingham before taking on Manchester United in their final fixture. Manchester United cruised to a 3-0 win over West Ham United to climb back into third place above Manchester City, who thumped Brighton & Hove Albion 7-2 on Saturday.

The striker scored the only goal of the game in the 46th minute to keep Frank Lampard sides’ fate in their own hands. In the celebrations that followed Richarlison’s goal, a lit blue smoke canister was thrown on to the pitch by supporters. Richarlison responded by picking the object up and throwing it, although it was unclear where it landed. A club spokesperson said: ""We will look into the matter but, as far we we are concerned, Richarlison was attempting to throw it out of the ground."" In February, Liverpool midfielder Harvey Elliott was contacted by the FA after handling a red flare following the side’s Carabao Cup victory at Wembley.

Tottenham’s win over Leicester earlier in the day had piled the pressure on Arteta’s side, who kicked-off in fifth place and without key defender Ben White, who missed out with a tight hamstring. In as his replacement, Holding scored the first Premier League goal of his career when he glanced in an opener just after the half-hour mark before Jarrod Bowen’s equaliser. Gabriel would then score a second header as Arsenal saw the game out, moving back above Spurs in a tight Champions League battle. It was another impressive performance from Holding in particular, his second in quick-succession after playing a crucial role in the 4-2 win at Chelsea last month, a result that got Arsenal moving back up the table following a run of three consecutive losses. After the game, Arteta told Sky Sports: “We showed incredible spirit because when we could play the way we wanted to play we had to find a way to play the way they prefer. We adapted. You have to find a way to win all the time to win - forcing mistakes, being brilliant, digging in, clean sheets. “I am really happy, especially for Rob Holding as he hasn’t played the amount of minutes he deserves.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/thomas-tuchel-chelsea-premier-league-top-four-b997416.html,Thomas Tuchel admits Chelsea are ‘never safe’ in top-four race after Everton defeat,"homas Tuchel claims Chelsea are now in a battle to secure top four after just two wins in their last six Premier League games. A 1-0 defeat to Everton continued their shaky end of season form and threatens to drag them back towards to Tottenham and Arsenal in the fight for Champions League places. Tuchel criticised his defence for another costly error that gifted Richarlison the winning goal just after half time. But it was a day when his attack let him down once again – even if it required the brilliance of Jordan Pickford to get Everton over the line. Tuchel said: “I said this many weeks ago that I didn’t feel safe and we are never safe. By the way, if we are in a race for top one, top two or top four, no matter what the race, the last four games to only have four points will never be enough, no matter which race we are in. “We have to take care about ourselves. At the moment we don’t get the points when we play well and deserve more and we lose when we play okay. This is a bad mixture.” Cesar Azpilicueta was caught in possession by Richarlison, who fired the winner at the start of the second half. Tuchel has seen his side dominate possession against Manchester United and Everton in the space of three days, yet his team have only managed one goal and one point from those games. He insists the issue is in defence, not attack. “We knew what was coming and like in the last matches we struggled to have clean sheets,” he said. “In the last four we had one, against West Ham, it is the only win we have and I’m very disappointed. “What can I do? The ball is free, give a goal away, it is the worst thing that can happen to you in this atmosphere. It happens too often. We struggle to play without big mistakes and it is why we struggle to have results.” On his attack he added: “If there is something I can do I will try it, but if I knew about it I would have done it before. “For me the key is to have a clean sheet. Manchester United was a different game. More open, fluid. We finally scored late and conceded straight away. “For me this is more like the game against West Ham and we had a clean sheet and played without any big mistakes and that gives us the chance to score late. “If you install emotion and belief in a stadium like this, you struggle.” Everton fans tried to put Chelsea off by setting off fireworks outside the Liverpool Hilton hotel where they stayed on Saturday night. Tuchel said they did not affect him. “I personally woke up twice at 1am and 3am for one minute and after the noise. I turned around and kept on sleeping.” ",positive,chelsea
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-fc-pickford-everton-b997412.html,Magnificent Jordan Pickford display no excuse for Chelsea in latest lacklustre performance,"f not for Jordan Pickford, Chelsea would have won this match. But while the England goalkeeper was in Superman mode, it would be letting Thomas Tuchel’s side off the hook to suggest he was the overriding reason for Everton’s crucial 1-0 win. As inspired as he was, Chelsea were abject. They slept-walked through the first half at Goodison Park, stumbled into the traps Frank Lampard set – and, ultimately, got what they deserved. Absolutely nothing. Cesar Azpilicueta’s error at the start of the second half was seized on by Richarlison and may go a long way towards the Toffees’ Premier League survival. The roar from the home crowd that greeted every challenge won, every heroic moment from Pickford, and the final whistle - underlining just how significant a result this was. As for Chelsea, they felt ill-prepared for the fight they were in for, but – most worryingly for Tuchel – ill-prepared to capitalise on the dominance of the ball Lampard was clearly happy to concede. Chelsea’s manager simply must address this glaring weakness in his team if he is to have any hope of closing the gap to Manchester City and Liverpool next season. In back-to-back games in the North West this week – against Manchester United and Everton – they have bossed possession and chances created and walked away with one goal and one point from a possible six. That is not good enough for any team with realistic ambitions of the title. Which is why his claim that his defence is his biggest concern after these latest dropped points, may not sit too well with supporters. “If there is something I can do, I will try it, but if I knew about it I would have done it before,” Tuchel said. “For me the key is to have a clean sheet. The issue is that we don’t have enough clean sheets.” The ongoing lack of cohesion in his forward line, as well as lack of precision, has cost Chelsea too often this season and their manager cannot turn a blind eye to it. At this point it feels as much to do with personnel as the coaching. This is a problem that has been in place since Tuchel took charge 15 months ago, with the list of strikers who have failed to produce at the point of his attack stretching from Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud to Timo Werner and Romelu Lukaku. With Chelsea desperate for a goal with more than 20 minutes to go, Tuchel left £97.5million record signing Lukaku on the bench. That speaks volumes about the Belgian’s future – but also points to his manager’s failure to get a tune out of him. If a new centre forward is recruited this summer, would there be any confidence that he would thrive where a growing list of others have not? But it is not only the cutting edge. Where is Chelsea’s guile around the box to open up deep-lying defences? They too often rely on the width of Reece James or the injured Ben Chilwell - missing the sort of incisive, intricate football City and Liverpool produce. Mason Mount, deployed as a No10 again, is energetic, but at times his side need craft over graft. These are all areas Tuchel must look at if his side are to find another dimension. It was not until the second half, with Chelsea a goal behind and fortunate not to be two-down that they finally awoke from their slumber. Unfortunately for them, Pickford’s concentration levels were sharp despite his inaction. First the he tipped Mount’s effort from inside the box onto the post, with the ball rolling across to hit the other upright. From the rebound, Azpilicueta fired goalwards, but Pickford was there again to block. Moments later he was flying at the feet of Toni Rudiger to deny the Chelsea from close range – albeit with his face. He would not be beaten. Ruben Loftus-Cheek – one of Chelsea’s few players to try to open Everton up – struck from distance, only for Pickford to get a hand on it again. Even deep into stoppage time, substitute Mateo Kovacic was denied an equaliser when the keeper dived low to claw away from the bottom corner. Pickford celebrated every save like it was a goal – and so did the crowd. Chelsea’s fans, meanwhile, were given nothing to cheer. ",positive,chelsea

The first half consisted primarily of Chelsea possession and fouls. Five of a total eight yellow cards were handed out in the first 45 minutes, two of which came Cesar Azpilicueta and Seamus Coleman’s way after the captains tussled over a foul committed by Mason Mount, which also earned a booking. It was Azpilicueta who, moments after the restart, surrendered possession by his own penalty area for the opening goal. Demarai Gray slipped in Richarlison to bury the opener and send Goodison Park into raptures, matching the big-game atmosphere present all weekend on Merseyside as fireworks set off outside the Chelsea hotel overnight were followed by flares welcoming the home team bus into the stadium. Vitalii Mykolenko squandered a great chance for 2-0 immediately afterwards, firing over from close range, before Jordan Pickford came to Everton’s rescue. Mason Mount hit the post with a half-volley from outside the box, which rolled agonisingly along the goalline. Azpilicueta arrived on the scene to have a rebound stunningly denied by the keeper, who got up to save Antonio Rudiger’s point-blank effort from the subsequent corner with his face. With seven minutes of added time, Pickford again produced heroics to deny Mateo Kovacic after the midfielder wriggled free deep in the Everton box.

Cesar Azpilicueta surrendered possession on the edge of his own box to allow the Toffees to take the lead, as they took three points in the fight for survival. It was a scrappy performance from the Blues, who fell to defeat away from home for the first time since January. James Robson was at Goodison Park to give his verdict on the visiting players... Edouard Mendy - 6 Had very little to do – but could not keep out Richarlison’s strike. Let down by Azpilicueta on that occasion. Cesar Azpilicueta - 5 Took his eye off the ball and Chelsea paid as Richarlison struck. Typical of a performance when he seemed more interested in getting into arguments than concentrating on his job. Thiago Silva - 6 Felt like the only Chelsea defender not to lose his head on as when they allowed themselves to be frustrated by Everton. Antonio Rudiger - 6 Booked early on and had to walk a tightrope afterwards. Still as physical as you would expect, but there were some heart in mouth moments. Reece James - 6 After his brilliant performance at Old Trafford, there was a sense of him wanting to do too much on occasion here. At times he could have kept it simple as was caught as a result. Still one of Chelsea’s most threatening players. Jorginho - 4 Chelsea needed him to be more dynamic. His one-paced display typified the lack of urgency in his side’s first-half offering. Ruben Loftus-Cheek - 6 Chelsea’s best moments of a dour first half came from his bursts through midfield. One of the few players in yellow to try to open Everton up. Marcos Alonso - 6 He had more reason than most to pile the misery on Lampard after the break down of their relationship at Chelsea. Pushed high to give Chelsea an outlet on the left. Mason Mount - 6 So close to scoring. Not short of endeavour, but in that No10 role he needs to produce a bit more craft to got along with the graft. Timo Werner - 5 Largely ineffective. Got himself into some decent areas, but never did anything with those opportunities. Kai Havertz - 6 Worked hard and it was clear how he was trying to get between the lines of Everton’s defence. Did not look like scoring. Substitutes Mateo Kovacic (Jorginho, 46) - 6 Brought a bit more drive to Chelsea’s midfield to try to break Everton out of their comfortable shape. Christian Pulisic (Azpilicueta, 68) - 4 Struggled much like the rest of Chelsea’s forwards. Hakim Ziyech (Werner, 68) - 5 Produced the odd threatening cross. Not a lot else.

A really entertaining conclusion to the match, which finishes level. Celtic will take that - they have a six-point lead with three matches remaining. Fashion Sakala got the equaliser and very nearly had the winner late on, but the woodwork denied him and Rangers. 90 mins: Abada has the ball in the back of the net, but the flag has long been up for offside. It is absolute chaos at Celtic Park. Just two minutes added on. 88 mins: Corner for Rangers, it’s cleared and Celtic are on the break. Abada looks to have the Rangers half to himself, but Diallo gets back and pulls him to the ground. Yellow card. Breathless finish to this match. 86 mins: RANGERS HIT THE POST! What. A. Chance. Sakala had to win it for his side, won’t get a better chance than that. He was clean through, slid it past Hart at the near post but it cannons back off the post. 85 mins: AND THAT’S BRILLIANT FROM HART! All is forgiven. Rangers break away on the right with Wright who is far too quick for Starfelt. Cuts it back, Arfield flicks it at goal... Hart sticks a big hand out. Makes the save from the rebound too. Big moment in the match. 83 mins: What a mess from Joe Hart. Takes an age to move with the ball at his feet... and then just falls over. Kicks it straight to Kent, but fortunately for the goalkeeper Rangers can’t take advantage. 81 mins: Celtic have taken a bit more control now, would have to say they probably look the more likely to find a winner. Not a huge amount of space on offer for either side though. As it stands, it’s a point that Celtic will be more than happy with. 78 mins: Yellow card starting to put a serious shift in. Kent the latest addition to the book as he’s penalised for a high boot. Maeda off, Abada on for Celtic for the final 15 minutes or so. 77 mins: Giakoumakis with an unnecessary challenge, not his first since coming on. He’s earned a yellow card for it too. He’s certainly been keen to make an impact, you have to give him that! ",positive,chelsea

A 4-0 win over Espanyol over Saturday sealed La Liga glory for Real to ensure that Ancelotti has won the league in his first season back at the Bernabeu. A draw would have been good enough, but Rodrygo netted twice and Marco Asensio and Karim Benzema also got on the scoresheet to get the job done in style. The Italian left Real back in 2015 after three years in charge in which he was unable to lead them to the title. It’s the latest in a long line of trophies that he has lifted. Ancelotti won Serie A in 2004 when he was managing AC Milan and then sealed Premier League glory in 2010 as Chelsea boss. His time at PSG saw him win Ligue 1 in 2013, before leading Bayern Munich to the league title in 2017. Ancelotti will be hoping there is even more success to come for him this season, with Champions League glory still a possibility. “I’m very proud of this,” Ancelotti said. “I’ve had a very long season, but I’m still enjoying it.” “Now I’m with Real Madrid, and to win with Real Madrid is very special. “This is the first time for me to win a title at the (Santiago) Bernabeu, and the atmosphere here is special.” It’s a 35th La Liga triumph for Real Madrid, with the players marking it after the match by throwing Ancelotti up in the air. He did not want the fun to stop. “I told Marcelo that I wanted to keep going,” Ancelotti joked. “I was enjoying being up there in the air.” Along with Bob Paisley and Zinedine Zidane, Ancelotti has won the European Cup or Champions League on three occasions as a manager, with two of those coming when it charge at AC Milan and the third in 2014 when Real lifted the trophy for a tenth time. Champions League success this season would see him break that managerial record, though there is a tough task ahead. Real have a one-goal deficit to overcome on Wednesday night, after losing 4-3 to Manchester City in the first leg, though the Spanish side have already knocked out PSG and Chelsea this season despite not being at their best.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-sir-jim-ratcliffe-bid-owner-b997180.html,Chelsea: Sir Jim Ratcliffe makes sensational late bid to buy club with £4.25billion offer,"ir Jim Ratcliffe, owner of petrochemical giant Ineos, has made a sensational last-gasp bid to buy Chelsea. Ratcliffe, one of Britain’s richest men, has been linked with a takeover of Chelsea in the past but only last month a spokesperson dismissed reports he could succeed Roman Abramovich. The race to buy the club following the sanctioning of Russian billionaire Abramovich had been whittled down to three contenders, with consortiums headed by former Liverpool chairman Sir Michael Broughton, LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly and Steve Pagliuca, who co-owns the Boston Celtics, left in the running after a fourth prospective owner - the Ricketts family - pulled out. The process had been nearing its conclusion, with a preferred buyer due to be announced but 69-year-old Ratcliffe revealed to The Times that he had submitted a late offer to US merchant bank Raine Group - who are overseeing the sale - on Friday morning worth more than £4billion, having held talks with Blues chairman Bruce Buck yesterday. An Ineos statement confirmed: “Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Chairman of INEOS, has made a formal bid for Chelsea FC, for £4.25bn. £2.5bn is committed to the Charitable Trust to support victims of the war, with £1.75bn committed to investment directly into the club over the next 10 years. “This is a British bid, for a British club. We believe that a club is bigger than its owners who are temporary custodians of a great tradition. With responsibility to the fans and the community. That is why we are committing to spending £1.75bn over 10 years that will be for the direct benefit of the club. We will invest in Stamford Bridge to make it a world-class stadium, befitting of Chelsea FC. This will be organic and on-going so that we will not move away from the home of Chelsea and risk losing the support of loyal fans.” Ratcliffe already has significant experience in sport, currently the owner of Ligue 1 side OGC Nice and Tour de France-winning cycling team Ineos Grenadiers. Ineos are also principal sponsors of Formula One world champions Mercedes and sailing’s Ineos Team UK. Their statement continued: “We will continue to invest in the team to ensure we have a first class squad of the world’s greatest players, coaches and support staff, in the men’s and women’s games. “And we hope to continue to invest in the academy to provide opportunity for talented youngsters to develop into first class players. We believe that London should have a club that reflects the stature of the city. One that is held in the same regard as Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich. We intend Chelsea to be that club. “We are making this investment as fans of the beautiful game – not as a means to turn a profit. We do that with our core businesses. The club is rooted in its community and its fans. And it is our intention to invest in Chelsea FC for that reason.” ",positive,chelsea

Following the deadline for offers to take over the Premier League giants from Roman Abramovich, a trio of official bids had landed before it emerged on Friday that Boehly had been given the go-ahead to complete a deal. Sir Jim Ratcliffe had entered the running late on as a surprise fourth party interested in buying the Blues for £4.25billion before it was confirmed that Steven Pagliuca’s bid had failed. Rivalling Boehly is an offer fronted by former British Airways chief Sir Martin Broughton, with backing from the likes of Formula One legend Sir Lewis Hamilton and tennis superstar Serena Williams. But the American’s consortium appear set to seal the takeover with funding coming from Boehly, fellow Dodgers co-owner Mark Walters and Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss. Reports suggest they will now have up to a week to finalise an exclusivity agreement for their £3.5bn-plus takeover. All bids included significant investment in renovating Stamford Bridge and property developer Jonathan Goldstein has already been enlisted by the Boehly to help oversee the project.

The Brazilian has travelled after resuming running but won’t play at the Estadio de la Ceramica, where Liverpool head holding a commanding two-goal lead courtesy of a dominant first-leg win at Anfield last week. “Bobby is now running, so it’s good,” Klopp said at his pre-match press conference on Monday. “A little strain here in the middle foot bone, so it’s very painful each step. “But he was running today again, will travel with us but will not be involved in the squad yet.

The quadruple-chasing Reds travel to eastern Spain holding a commanding 2-0 lead in their last-four tie after a Pervis Estupinan own goal and Sadio Mane’s second-half effort in a one-sided first leg at Anfield last week. However, manager Jurgen Klopp is not taking anything for granted on the road to Paris, insisting it is a difficult scoreline as Unai Emery pledged to make his side “suffer” in Tuesday’s return clash. Liverpool followed up that dominant win over Villarreal in which they held 73 per cent of the overall possession and allowed only one shot (which was off-target) by triumphing at Newcastle on Saturday, with Naby Keita’s fourth goal of the season in the early Premier League kick-off ensuring they piled the pressure on title rivals Manchester City, who responded with a routine 3-0 victory at Leeds later in the day to regain top spot with four games to go. Much-changed Villarreal, meanwhile, slumped to a disappointing 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Alaves at the weekend, leaving them seventh in LaLiga, four points adrift of the top six and nine behind Atletico Madrid in fourth. Their hopes of playing in Europe at all next season could well now rest on pulling off an incredible comeback against six-time champions Liverpool and winning the whole competition, with either Real Madrid or Manchester City awaiting the winners of this tie in the final at the Stade de France on May 28. Liverpool vs Villarreal is scheduled for an 8pm BST kick-off on Tuesday May 3, 2022. The match will take place at the Estadio de la Ceramica - better known as El Madrigal - in Villarreal, Spain.

Liverpool will remain without Roberto Firmino on Tuesday, though the Brazilian forward is now back running after nursing a foot issue and is set to travel to Spain with his team-mates. Divock Origi will be assessed after missing the win over Newcastle through non-Covid illness, though Curtis Jones and Kostas Tsimikas are available again. Klopp made five changes in total at St James’ Park, with Mohamed Salah, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ibrahima Konate all moving to the bench. That quintet should return to the starting lineup against Villarreal, though it’s a difficult juggling act with Tottenham visiting Anfield on Saturday evening and the FA Cup Final against Chelsea now less than two weeks away. Mo Salah will return to Liverpool’s starting XI against Villarreal after being rested at Newcastle Klopp is not expecting any players to miss out with a stomach bug that has been in camp of late. Villarreal boss Emery made eight changes of his own against Alaves, with only Samuel Chukwueze, Dani Parejo and Pau Torres retaining their starting berths from Anfield. Former Liverpool full-back Alberto Moreno remains sidelined with a long-term knee injury, but a major boost should come with the return of key striker Gerard Moreno, who sat out the first leg with a hamstring complaint. Raul Albiol and ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin have both shaken off knocks, though Arnaut Danjuma is now struggling with a foot problem after missing training on Monday. Predicted Villarreal XI: Rulli, Foyth, Albiol, Torres, Estupinan, Parejo, Capoue, Coquelin, Lo Celso, Chukwueze, Gerard Predicted Liverpool XI: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Konate, Robertson; Fabinho, Henderson, Thiago; Mane, Salah, Diaz Villarreal’s gameplan totally failed at Anfield, with no shots on target, barely any possession and next to no opportunities to hit on the break. Untroubled Liverpool were entirely comfortable and should unquestionably have won by more as they serenely controlled and dominated proceedings. The wily Emery will have to make big tactical changes for the second leg as they need to put Liverpool under far more pressure from the outset. However, their chances of breaching a mean defence that have now kept four successive clean sheets across all competitions appear slim. Villarreal need to push on and take the initiative in front of their own fans, which will inevitably leave plenty of space in behind for the likes of Salah, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz to exploit. Liverpool to win, 2-0. Villarreal’s only win over Liverpool to date came on home soil back in the first leg of the Europa League semi-finals in 2016, with an injury-time effort from Adrian Lopez. However, the Reds hit back with goals from Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana at Anfield, winning 3-0 to book their place in the Basel showpiece, which they lost to Emery’s Sevilla.

Spurs will consider offers for Bergwijn this month but want to recoup closer to the £27m they paid PSV Eindhoven for the winger two years ago. Bergwijn, 24, was the first permanent signing of Jose Mourinho's tenure in January 2020 but could be the first departure under Antonio Conte, if Ajax return with a sufficiently improved offer. Bergwijn, who was born in Amsterdam, came through the ranks at Ajax before joining their rivals PSV in 2011, and is thought to be open to a return to the Eredivisie champions after two frustrating years in the Premier League. Spurs, however, would be reluctant to allow Bergwijn to leave until they have signed a replacement, particularly with Heung-min Son currently sidelined with a hamstring injury until at least the end of the month. Bergwijn made an impressive start at Spurs, scoring in his first three home league games including stunners against both Manchester clubs, but he has since struggled for confidence and fitness. He scored just once last season and opened his account for this term in December's 2-1 win over West Ham in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals, also assisting Lucas Moura's winner. Tottenham will allow Dutch winger Steven Bergwijn to leave the club this month His display earned praise from Conte, who has raised the possibility of Bergwijn deputising for Harry Kane up front when the England captain needs a rest. Bergwijn has not played since Boxing Day due to a calf injury but Conte said before Sunday's 3-1 win over Morecambe he expected to welcome back the Dutch international ""very soon"". Quizzed on Bergwijn’s future at a press conference held before the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg against Chelsea, Conte said: “Honestly, Bergwijn he knows very well what I think about him. I consider him a player that can play in all three roles. As a No9 and as a No10. “For sure, in my period at Tottenham, he was injured for a long time but I showed him that when he’s in a good physical condition, I gave him a chance to show he’s a good player. For sure, Bergwijn is a Tottenham player and he’s very close to coming back. “After the game against Chelsea, he can start having training sessions with us. I count on him. He’s a player with different characteristics to Sonny, Lucas and Harry. He’s very good 1v1, he’s a creative player that we don’t have in our squad.” ",positive,chelsea

Emma Hayes’ side were not at their best against Spurs but Beth England and Kerr’s goals, either side of Kerys Harrop equalising for Spurs, secured them a vital 2-1 win. It means Chelsea are now four points clear of Arsenal at the top of the WSL with two matches to go, although the Gunners have a game in hand. “They (Tottenham) have taken big points off big clubs this year, so we knew it wasn’t going to be easy,” said Kerr. “They’re a good team so it does feel like a good three points, but any win is an important win now. There are two games to go and we’re just going to grind through. If we get all six points we’re champions.” Chelsea’s win last night has put pressure on Arsenal, who are trying to catch the Blues in the final stretch. They have a game in hand on Hayes’ side, which is next Wednesday when they host Tottenham at Emirates Stadium, but before that they will take on Aston Villa on Sunday. Chelsea, meanwhile, are travelling to bottom of the table Birmingham. “We’re in the title race and fighting to be champions. Last season the team was fighting to get third place,” said Arsenal boss Jonas Eidevall. “It’s much more fun to be fighting for the title and if anyone had told us that before the season we would’ve taken it, so let’s enjoy it.” Arsenal will play before Chelsea on Sunday, kicking off at 2pm and four hours earlier than the Blues in the evening. “We just have to control what we can do and get the three points each game and we’re praying Chelsea slip up,” Beth Mead added.

Gordon has the chance to whip in a good delivery which goes far too deep - and out of play. Chelsea haven’t been up to it and they can hardly complain about going a goal down.

The 37-year-old scored his 17th Premier League goal of the season on Thursday to rescue a point against Chelsea and his overall tally stands at 23 in 37 club appearances. United’s problems are surely more systemic than merely Ronaldo, who remains an elite goalscorer, but his signing has been criticised in some quarters as an example of the club being focused on superstar names rather than coherent strategy. The arrival of Erik Ten Hag this summer further muddies the waters. With the Dutchman needing to rebuild, it’s unclear as to whether or not Ronaldo will feature, or even if the Portugal international would wish to given United will likely miss out on Champions League qualification. Under contract until the summer of 2023, Ronaldo has previously hinted he does not want to be challenging for merely a place in the top four. Speaking after United’s draw with Chelsea, Rangnick said: “His attitude, he’s 37 - it’s not normal. If he plays like he did yesterday he can still be a big help to this team. “It’s ten Hag and also Cristiano’s decision for what he can do next, but his performance was great.” ",positive,chelsea

The all-time kings of Europe reduced to the role of fools. Real Madrid endured a chastening night at the hands of Manchester City, when their very place in history was rocked to the core. Yet they head to the Bernabeu next week with everything to play for. This Champions League semi-final should have been over after half an hour, with Real humbled and humiliated by City’s sheer superiority. But Pep Guardiola’s side head to Spain with the slenderest 4-3 advantage after a night when it was impossible to shake the sense that an opportunity had been missed. It was notable that the Catalan needed to remind his players after this thrilling, breathless and reckless clash that they had won on the night. It felt like he was trying to convince himself. “Football is football, the result is the result, but how we performed is exceptional,” said Guardiola. “Nobody can say the performance was not good. I want to convince my players that we won the game and lift their heads up.” City were irresistible at times. They scored four and could have comfortably doubled that figure. Even after Karim Benzema’s Panenka penalty late completed the scoring, the home side had at least two more glorious chances to further extend their lead. It was that kind of night, with Real helpless to stop City when they were in full flow. But Carlo Ancelotti’s side do not know when they are beaten. That weight of history means there is never a lost cause – and with players like Benzema, Luka Modric and Vinicius Junior, they always have a chance. “If Real have three chances, they will score five goals,” said one Spanish journalist before kick-off. And while that was not the case, it was remarkable how they made the most of the moments when they came their way. Benzema’s ageless brilliance was on show again after disposing of Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea in the previous two rounds. At the Etihad, he had three shots and two goals, with the other effort blocked. City had done well early on to force him to do much of his work in deep areas to keep him away from the danger zone. In reality, his composure on the ball only helped to settle Real at the point when the City storm was at its most ferocious. Manchester City should have been out of sight against Real Madrid after just half an hour of the semi-final first-leg clash His first goal served notice to City of the danger of playing with too much abandon, halving the deficit after Kevin de Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus had fired the home side into a 2-0 lead inside 11 minutes. It instilled an uncertainty in Guardiola’s rearguard that remained throughout and is sure live on into next week’s second leg. Who would be brave enough to predict the outcome of that match, which cannot come soon enough? The expectation would be that both teams would try to tighten up defensively, but the question is whether either can? Real looked as vulnerable as they did in their quarter-final second leg against Chelsea, when they were blown away in front of their own fans by Thomas Tuchel’s side. Only the cushion of their 3-1 win at Stamford Bridge – and the brilliance of Modric and Benzema – saw them stumble over the line. Against City their tactic appeared to be no more than riding the storm and seizing their own moments. Guardiola – who was without a recognised right-back last night – will see his team significantly improved by the return of Joao Cancelo from suspension. But how Ruben Dias or Aymeric Laporte recover from such a wounding experience remains to be seen. But inspired by the ageless brilliance of Karim Benzema, the LaLiga champions-elect never know when they are beaten “If we play like we did in the second half, we won’t be able to win,” said Guardiola. “If we play like we did at other periods, we will. When I became a footballer and a manager, when you go to the Bernabeu there is no option but to win. You have to come through these situations to win the Champions League.” Ancelotti, meanwhile, warned City they might have missed a golden chance to secure their place in a second successive final. “It is a defeat that leaves us alive in the second leg,” he said. “We have to be better in our defensive aspect, but I believe we are able to create problems for them also. “In the second game I think if we defend better, we will win - but if we defend like today, we will be out of the competition.” Another classic lies in wait.

Todd Boehly’s consortium have already held talks at Stamford Bridge and Sir Martin Broughton is also due to run through his proposals one last time. There is hope among the candidates that the process will come to an end this week, although they are still to be given any guidance by Raine over time frames. There is an acceptance that the speed with which the takeover has had to be conducted – due to the UK Government sanctioning Abramovich over his links to Vladimir Putin – has meant for the shifting of parameters. Shortlisted bidders are making their final pitches in the race to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich Raine has asked a series of “comfort questions” and demanded a commitment from each bidder not to sell the club for 10 years. They have also asked for £1billion-worth of investment on top of the sale to ensure the ongoing success of the club. The final pitches have been described by sources close to the process as a normal part of the procedure, even after representatives from each consortium met with members of Chelsea’s executive before submitting official offers earlier this month. Pagliuca is due to fly into London today and head to Stamford Bridge. The co-owner of the NBA’s Boston Celtics has been the lowest key of the remaining candidates, with his interest in the club not known until late in the bidding process.

The three remaining candidates have been asked a host of follow-up queries, even after submitting final offers earlier this month. There is an acceptance that the speed of the process – due to the sanctioning of Roman Abramovich – has led to a number of details needing to be ironed out on an ongoing basis. But it is understood Abramovich wants to be assured the next owners will commit to Chelsea for the next decade.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/pep-guardiola-man-city-champions-league-biggest-threat-b996304.html,Pep Guardiola remains biggest threat to Man City’s Champions League hopes... he must keep emotions in check,"ith respect to Real Madrid’s golden oldies, Pep Guardiola remains the greatest threat to Manchester City reaching back-to-back Champions League finals. We are at that stage when the Catalan can over-think, at best, or go into complete meltdown, at worst. Either way, City’s failure to replicate their domestic dominance in Europe has generally been self-inflicted. That they go into tonight’s semi-final first leg as overwhelming favourites underlines the quality of Guardiola’s squad, considering they face a team on the verge of winning the Spanish title and are playing at this stage of the competition for the 31st time. Guardiola has, arguably, had the deepest pool of talent in Europe for the past five years, yet last season was his first final as City manager and defeat to Chelsea continued a pattern that has seen him lose to underdogs in each of his Champions League campaigns with the club. From Monaco to Tottenham to Lyon, City have contrived to find a way to blow it, just as the draw looked like opening up for them — and Guardiola’s fingerprints have been all over each of those disappointments. None more so than last May’s final, when he named a starting XI without a holding midfielder. When Thomas Tuchel got wind of the news while on the team bus, driving to the stadium in Porto, he quickly altered his own plans. Chelsea’s winning goal from Kai Havertz came as a result of Mason Mount exposing that glaring hole in the City team to play the German through. So, it has reached the point where City fans are left looking through their fingers as the Champions League reaches the crunch stages for fear of what Guardiola will do next. If they can be sure of anything, it is that Madrid will be ready to pounce on any chance given. They are in the last four because of Chelsea’s own meltdown in the first leg of their quarter-final at Stamford Bridge. Calamitous defending gifted them a 3-1 lead to defend at the Bernabeu. Even then, Carlo Ancelotti’s side were 15 minutes from being eliminated until a sublime moment from Luka Modric set up Rodrygo to send the tie into extra time. Pep Guardiola has been known to over-think his selection and tactical decisions in Manchester City’s quest for Champions League glory That game in Spain should be instructive to Guardiola: Madrid could not handle Chelsea’s speed and aggression. Only the cushion from the first leg allowed them to recover by picking their moments through the individual brilliance of Modric and Karim Benzema. They are capable of producing those moments against City, but are unlikely to be gifted the freedom they were in the first 50 minutes at Stamford Bridge. That is, unless Guardiola strikes again. City’s own performance in the Spanish capital against Atletico in the last round should serve as encouragement that they have matured on this stage. For all the recriminations directed at Diego Simeone and his streetwise team, City used all the gamesmanship they could muster to frustrate and run the clock down. It was a defensive masterclass, right out of the Simeone playbook. In previous years, Guardiola might have been tempted to play his way out of trouble. On this occasion, City snapped and snarled and stubbornly got over the finishing line. It felt like a significant moment for the club and their manager in terms of their European evolution.

In front of a sparse United crowd amid a fan protest against the Glazer ownership, Chelsea quickly settled into a good rhythm. Kai Havertz was guilty of squandering the visitors’ most significant openings in the first half, whipping a shot against the side netting after a breakaway before slapping a one-on-one shot against David De Gea’s shoulder. The goalkeeper was then able to deny a free header, straight at him, as Chelsea produced everything but a finish. Reece James and Mason Mount were enjoying the freedom of Manchester down the right and the midfielder attempted to prise open the deadlock with a whipped cross that beat De Gea, and Timo Werner, shortly after the break. Beforehand, Havertz had again wasted a good counter with a sloppy pass. SPONSORED It was no surprise when Marcos Alonso popped up, unmarked, to fire Chelsea ahead on the hour mark after another move down the right. But even the most optimistic of home fans would not have expected Cristiano Ronaldo to appear moments later and slam home a leveller, after good work from Nemanja Matic. That goal did little to lift United in the grand run of the game and James hit the post with a left-footed strike from outside the box after a nice tee-up by Mount.

The Dutchman will take over in the summer after a poor period for the Red Devils under Ralf Rangnick, leading to Keane’s optimism that he will get a good view of the team ahead of his first day in the role. The ex-midfielder told Sky Sports ahead of the game with Chelsea on Thursday: “I think he’s a good appointment, there’s been a lot of speculation and the club will be glad to get the deal done - so he can start looking at the club and the background. “He’s got a solid CV, a very good reputation. But I suppose the proof will be in the pudding and we’ll know better when he’s in the job and he gets the backing, the support and hopefully a little bit of power to get United back competing at the top.” United legend Keane warned Ten Hag that he has a big job on in the transfer market, echoing Gary Neville’s sentiment of a potentially “brutal transition”. “He’s got to get a group of players that will give everything for the cause, that will be hard to beat,” he added. “Hopefully he’ll have a style of play that entertains the fans, but it’s a rebuilding job. He’s fortunate coming in in the summer with five or six players on big contracts already leaving - that will help. “I think every United manager will get backing, he will get some money to spend but it’s about getting the right players and right characters into the club - what we’ve seen from this group of players that last few months has not been good enough.” ",positive,chelsea

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-spurs-levy-summer-conte-transfers-b996593.html,Tottenham: Daniel Levy facing huge summer dilemma as Antonio Conte plots transfer overhaul,"aniel Levy is experienced enough to brush off speculation and is used to ignoring noise from his managers, but employing Antonio Conte must occasionally test the Tottenham chairman’s patience. This week, in the wake of Spurs’ frustrating stalemate with Brentford which dented their chances of returning to the Champions League, a fresh round of reports linked Conte with a summer exit, with the head coach rumoured to be interested in succeeding Mauricio Pochettino at Paris Saint-Germain. They raised the intriguing prospect of a sensational job swap between Conte and Pochettino, but Levy will surely be growing exasperated with Conte’s quit threats and rumours of his interest in other jobs — even if the Italian’s camp insist the PSG stories did not come from them. While Pochettino’s likely dismissal by PSG offers Levy an attractive safety net in the event that Conte walks at the end of the season, the danger for the chairman is a repeat of last summer, which he spent searching for a new manager and battling with Harry Kane over his future. These concerns are part of the package in employing Conte, who is notoriously high maintenance and described by one senior figure at Chelsea as making Jose Mourinho “look like a pussycat”. The hard-to-please coach will always demand more and his rhetoric should be viewed, at least in part, as a means of pressuring the club to give him what he wants. Clearly, there is an argument that Levy and managing director Fabio Paratici should do whatever possible to appease Conte in the transfer market this summer. Given Tottenham’s position in the food chain, the chairman may never again have one of the world’s top coaches, at the very peak of his powers, in his employ, and for all the (justified) talk of Pochettino being a better profile of manager for the club, backing Conte still feels like Spurs’ best chance of real success next season. For Levy, it is not quite so simple, though. Conte’s short-term contract, which runs until the end of next season, and his apparent concerns that Spurs do not have the means to compete for the League title, mean Levy and Paratici will have to be particularly careful to sign players who suit both Conte and the club this summer. As Saturday’s draw demonstrated, Conte is rigidly committed to his preferred system and, if he stays in north London, he wants at least six new players — among them two wing-backs and a left-sided centre-half who can play in a back three. He also favours experienced, senior players. Should Daniel Levy back Antonio Conte in the transfer market, knowing he could walk away from Tottenham? Conte tends to leave clubs in a better condition than he finds them but Levy will still be wary of backing the head coach to the tune of millions of pounds on specialist players when there remains a danger he could walk away as soon as he gets a more attractive offer, or at the end of his contract. Levy has already showed an admirable willingness to back Conte, offloading the club’s record signings, Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso, for nothing in January, and signing Dejan Kulusevski — a former Conte target at Inter Milan — and Rodrigo Bentancur from Juventus. Completely reshaping the squad in Conte’s image, however, poses long-term risks while his position and future remain uncertain, so Levy and Paratici must tread carefully. Liverpool’s rebuild under Jurgen Klopp, by contrast, was made easier by his long-term commitment to the club, ensuring they could sign players to suit the German’s approach. Manchester City have done the same with Pep Guardiola but Spurs are disadvantaged both by being more financially prudent than their rivals in the market, and having a rigid tactician whose future is not certain. Spurs have already spent £50million on a centre-half who excels in a back three and spending the same again on a left-footed version of Cristian Romero may not suit, say, Pochettino, who prefers playing a four-man defence (and might have also been happy to work with Lo Celso and Ndombele, as another example). It might be in Conte’s interests to start showing some commitment to Spurs, starting with a new deal The success of Kulusevski and Bentancur offer reasons for optimism, proving that Paratici can find targets to suit the club’s policy of young, versatile players while still satisfying Conte, but this summer will certainly test the relationship between the two Italians, and Levy’s willingness to cede control over big deals to the pair. Paradoxically, in pushing Spurs to back him with a drip-drip of hints and threats, Conte has arguably made it harder for the club to give him everything he wants. It might be in Conte’s interests to start showing some commitment to Spurs, starting with a new deal, if he is to convince the club to go full-throttle behind his vision. ",positive,chelsea

Son suffered a muscle injury in his leg during Wednesday's 2-0 defeat to Chelsea in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at Stamford Bridge. Spurs have five matches before the end of January, with League One Morecambe the visitors in the FA Cup third round on Sunday before the second leg against Chelsea on Wednesday night. They also play European rivals Arsenal, Leicester and Chelsea in the league before the end of the month. “The day after [the Chelsea game], he felt a bit of pain in his muscle, in his leg,” Conte said of Son. “He had a scan and now we have to make the right evaluation from the doctors. He has an injury. I don’t know, but probably he will stay without training sessions until the end of this cycle, for the international break.” In a separate interview with Spurs TV, Conte clarified that Son was expected to be sidelined for around two weeks. The Italian plans to rest Harry Kane against the Shrimps this weekend and rotate his side, but it is unclear who will deputise up front, with Steven Bergwijn, who Conte has previously touted for the role of Kane’s understudy, also injured. “Honestly, Harry played six games in 17 days,” Conte said. “And I think if I have the possibility, I think it’s right to give him a bit of a rest. “Also because after this game, before the international break, we have four games, very difficult games. Chelsea, Arsenal, Leicester and then Chelsea again. It’s always difficult to think, to decide not to start with Harry. But at the same time, in some games if we can take the risk it’s right to take. Heung-min Son was injured during Tottenham’s Carabao Cup defeat by Chelsea “I spoke with Steven today and his feeling is good. He’s improving day by day, step by step. My expectation and the medical department's expectation is to come back very soon. We need to help him. Also we had a problem with Son during the game against Chelsea. It will be very important to recover Steven Bergwijn.” Conte confirmed that Dele Alli would feature against Morecambe, while Bryan Gil, Giovani Lo Celso, Harry Winks, Tanguy Ndombele and Joe Rodon are also hoping for minutes.

To expect anything in the way of wholesale changes during the arduous January market would be too much, although Conte is a man who does need satisfying. Having constantly spoken about needing to raise the level of the team, surely Spurs will be doing all they can to back him during what remains of this month. At least showing Conte there’s a chance to grow and a readiness to provide him with fresh options is of the utmost importance. If the the Italian does not feel there’s a willingness to rebuild the squad, perhaps the former Chelsea boss’ frustration will grow. With that in mind, here’s a look at the latest on Spurs’ transfer gossip. SPONSORED According to Fabrizio Romano, Spurs and Newcastle United have had loan offers for the forward snubbed. While Martial is believed to be looking for a way out of Old Trafford, it seems his future could lie abroad. Sevilla, Barcelona and Juventus are all said to be keen in what must be a blow for Spurs given Conte has called for a new addition in that department. Dan Kilpatrick has previously reported that Fabio Paratici is actively looking to sell the midfielder. Conte has been rather cutting in his assessment of the Frenchman and, after being booed off against Morecambe in the FA Cup, it’s very hard to see a way back for him. Still, finding a buyer this month is likely to be difficult. Perhaps the major name to have been linked with Spurs this month, Wolves have snubbed a £15m offer for the player and are holding out for £20m, It remains to be seen if Spurs will go that far. Given Pierluigi Gollini has barely covered himself in glory and Hugo Lloris is yet to extend his contract, a new goalkeeper could be needed at Spurs. Earlier this month, the MEN reported that Spurs were keen on a move for Manchester United’s Dean Henderson, although Ralf Rangnick has since stressed he’s looking to keep the England hopeful despite his lack of first-team minutes.

Kai Havertz’s early strike and a Ben Davies own goal set the Blues on course for a day out at Wembley - although they must first navigate a tricky trip to North London to face old boss Antonio Conte. While Chelsea cruised past Chesterfield in the third-round of the FA Cup on Saturday, Spurs were forced into a late comeback to defeat League One side Morecambe in their tie. That result crystalised the size of the task Conte faces at Tottenham, who squeezed past Watford and drew at Southampton before the two cup matches. Without a trophy since their 2008 League Cup triumph, the pressure is on Spurs to mount a famous comeback whereas Champions League holders Chelsea last won this competition seven years ago.

Chelsea’s ruthless edge shone through in last season’s Champions League run and it is clear to see that Tottenham are far from the finished product under Conte.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-steven-bergwijn-goal-antonio-conte-b977709.html,Steven Bergwijn’s Lucas Moura ‘Ajax moment’ could be a springboard for the Antonio Conte era at Tottenham,"eep into stoppage time at the King Power, Tottenham were on course for another one of those nights, the kind that has come to typify their season. They had struck the woodwork, had two efforts heroically cleared off the line, missed several more clear-cut chances, yet at the end of it all, were on course to be undone by two Leicester goals that owed much to defensive passivity and misfortune. Sergio Reguilon’s tackle had fallen kindly for Patson Daka to open the scoring, then Japhet Tanganga’s attempted block took James Maddison’s effort past Hugo Lloris after Harry Kane had equalised. An unbeaten start to life under Antonio Conte in the Premier League - the saving grace and great cause for optimism amid a meagre Carabao Cup semi-final defeat and a controversial European exit - was about to go up in smoke. And then came Steven Bergwijn, with a late cameo that evoked memories of Lucas Moura against Ajax, scoring goals in the 95th and 97th minutes to give Spurs a victory that will be celebrated perhaps as much as any in the turbulent years since. The Dutchman, on as a substitute after Maddison’s strike had put the Foxes back ahead, smashed home from close range after Matt Doherty’s effort was blocked, then paid homage to Lucas in the Johan Cruyff Arena with a reverse-finish that slid agonisingly past a stranded keeper so unfathomably late in the day you feared the referee’s whistle might blow before it had time to cross the line. The famous 3-2 in Amsterdam provided the greatest night of Mauricio Pochettino’s era and, at last, Antonio Conte will feel that, in a victory on the road by the same scoreline, his own has its springboard. For were it not for the late drama, this would have been a defeat difficult for the Italian to take not because of his team’s inadequacies, but because of how much they had impressed. Despite starting with a midfield trio that, on paper, possessed about as much flair as a box of Bran Flakes, Spurs produced their most incisive attacking display for some time and could conceivably have scored five by half-time. Much of that owed to an improved performance from Kane and the return of Sergio Reguilon. Having Reguilon back from injury mercifully allowed Conte to call time on his experiment with Doherty as a left-wing-back and his presence made all the difference to Spurs as an attacking force. The Spaniard linked nicely with Kane and Lucas and brought a directness in the final-third that has been lacking during Doherty’s brief stint as deputy, the Irishman forever slowing attacks out of the necessity of checking back onto his right-foot. Earmarked as one of the players who could most benefit from Conte’s arrival, Reguilon’s stock has risen further as understudies have faltered during his absence and if Spurs can bring similar thrust to the opposite flank it will ease the burden on a midfield not blessed with creativity. To his credit, Doherty was much-improved returning to his preferred position on the right as a half-time replacement for the ineffectual Emerson Royal, but a good 45 minutes will have done little convince Conte he is the solution, against a hefty backcatalogue of work that suggests he is not. As for Kane, the Carabao Cup matches against Chelsea had represented a backwards step, after he had looked close to rediscovering his best form when scoring in three successive Premier League games in December. The England captain was a lumbering, peripheral figure stranded on halfway for much of that two-legged tie as Thomas Tuchel’s side held Spurs at arm’s length for the best part of 180 minutes. Given his goalscoring record against Arsenal, he must have been as frustrated as anyone to see Sunday’s derby fall by the wayside, but Leicester have proved even more fruitful opposition over the years and the 28-year-old put those Chelsea regressions behind him with a threatening, domineering display, the spearhead of a Spurs attack that looked as potent as it has all season, particularly before the break. His composed equaliser on 39 minutes came after he had already headed against the bar and been denied by Luke Thomas on the line, and took his tally against the Foxes to 18 in 17 career league appearances. As the clock ticked beyond 90 minutes, though, it still looked like it would be his failure to make it 19 when slid clean-through by Lucas at 1-1 that would prove decisive. That was until deep into stoppage time, when he in turn sent Bergwijn clear to ensure it, in fact, did not matter one jot. ",positive,chelsea

Richarlison goal - Premier League result, match stream and latest updates today","verton vs Chelsea FC LIVE! Richarlison profited from a Chelsea error to secure struggling Everton a 1-0 Premier League win and what could be a precious three points in their bid to avoid relegation at a rocking Goodison Park on Sunday. The home side grabbed the lead a minute into the second half after Cesar Azpilicueta gave up possession under pressure from the Brazilian forward, who harried the Chelsea captain into a mistake before slotting a low shot past goalkeeper Edouard Mendy. Chelsea dominated possession and Frank Lampard’s Everton had to hold on grimly for the final half-hour. They stay in the relegation zone, but move to within two points of Burnley and Leeds with a game in hand. SPONSORED Chelsea remain third with 66 points from 34 games as they bid to qualify for the Champions League. They are six points ahead of fifth-placed Arsenal, but have now played a game more. 56 mins: Richarlison is being a bit of a nightmare for Chelsea with his pace, physicality and drive exemplified by Silva fouling the striker near the corner flag. Gordon has the chance to whip in a good delivery which goes far too deep - and out of play. Chelsea haven’t been up to it and they can hardly complain about going a goal down. Horror mistake from Azpilicueta and it fits with what has been a tetchy performance from him. He’s looked to get into rows all day, when his focus should have been on the job at hand. That mistake was classic example of his mind being elsewhere. 51 mins: A response from Chelsea as Azpilicueta pushes into the box and wins a corner off Gray, who feels him hamstring after that neat lunge. The corner is bundled out of the box before Iwobi sends it long. Are Everton prepared to sit in and hold on for 40-plus minutes, or can they keep up the push for another goal? 49 mins: CHANCE FOR TWO! Everton are flying after that goal and Doucoure bundles the ball to Mykolenko, free on the left... and he fires over! 46 mins: RICHARLISON FOR EVERTON! A horror moment for Azpilicueta, who relinquishes possession far too easily by his own box and the Brazilian doesn’t need a second invitation! The second half gets underway with Kovacic back from injury to replace Jorginho for the visitors. A big 45 minutes for Everton to fight for a vital point, or even a massive win... Tottenham lead against Leicester thanks to a first-half Harry Kane goal in north London. That’s a game you can follow live here. Arsenal are taking on West Ham later this afternoon, with build-up taking place here. Chelsea have enjoyed 75 per cent of possession, which could explain why Everton have run 2.5km more than the visitors.

Celtic took a giant step towards clinching the Scottish Premiership title with an absorbing 1-1 draw against Old Firm rivals Rangers at Parkhead. The visitors, beaten 1-0 by RB Leipzig in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final in Germany on Thursday night, started positively and could have taken the lead through Ryan Kent when he missed a good chance. But in the 20th minute Portuguese attacker Jota volleyed past Gers goalkeeper Allan McGregor from close range. Striker Fashion Sakala levelled in the 68th minute with a powerful drive, and struck the post late on when clean through as he failed to take a massive opportunity.

A really entertaining conclusion to the match, which finishes level. Celtic will take that - they have a six-point lead with three matches remaining. Fashion Sakala got the equaliser and very nearly had the winner late on, but the woodwork denied him and Rangers. 90 mins: Abada has the ball in the back of the net, but the flag has long been up for offside. It is absolute chaos at Celtic Park. Just two minutes added on. 88 mins: Corner for Rangers, it’s cleared and Celtic are on the break. Abada looks to have the Rangers half to himself, but Diallo gets back and pulls him to the ground. Yellow card. Breathless finish to this match. 86 mins: RANGERS HIT THE POST! What. A. Chance. Sakala had to win it for his side, won’t get a better chance than that. He was clean through, slid it past Hart at the near post but it cannons back off the post. 85 mins: AND THAT’S BRILLIANT FROM HART! All is forgiven. Rangers break away on the right with Wright who is far too quick for Starfelt. Cuts it back, Arfield flicks it at goal... Hart sticks a big hand out. Makes the save from the rebound too. Big moment in the match. 83 mins: What a mess from Joe Hart. Takes an age to move with the ball at his feet... and then just falls over. Kicks it straight to Kent, but fortunately for the goalkeeper Rangers can’t take advantage. 81 mins: Celtic have taken a bit more control now, would have to say they probably look the more likely to find a winner.

Kent the latest addition to the book as he’s penalised for a high boot. Maeda off, Abada on for Celtic for the final 15 minutes or so. 77 mins: Giakoumakis with an unnecessary challenge, not his first since coming on. He’s earned a yellow card for it too.

Champions League result, match stream and latest updates today","anchester City vs Real Madrid! Manchester City claimed a slender advantage in their Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid after a dramatic 4-3 victory at the Etihad Stadium. The Premier League leaders raced into a 2-0 lead in a pulsating first-leg encounter with goals from the irrepressible Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus in the first 11 minutes. Real responded through the prolific Karim Benzema before Phil Foden and Vinicius Junior traded goals early in the second half. Bernardo Silva gave City a two-goal advantage but Benzema scored a cheeky penalty - his 41st goal of the season in as many appearances - to cut the deficit once again. Both sides spurned numerous other chances in a compelling and breathless clash that set the stage for a fascinating second leg next week. City may regret not making the most of a number of early opportunities as they stormed out of the blocks. They could almost have put the tie out of sight in the opening half-hour but Real, after fine comebacks against Paris St Germain and Chelsea in the previous two rounds, fought back again. Manchester City have a narrow lead at the halfway stage of their Champions League semi-final tie against Real Madrid after a thrilling 4-3 win at the Etihad. In an astonishing European match, City took a two-goal lead inside 11 minutes as Gabriel Jesus and Kevin De Bruyne got them off to a flying start. Karim Benzema notched his 40th goal of the season though, completely against the run of play, to halve the deficit. Phil Foden extended the lead shortly after the break, only for Vinicius Junior to respond almost immediately with a brilliant solo effort. Bernardo Silva lashed home from the edge of the box to make it 4-2, but there was still time for Benzema to step up to the spot and dispatch an impudent panenka. The game could have finished any score - as it is, Real will be incredibly relieved they are still right in the tie going into next week’s second leg in Madrid. Click here for our full report “I am a supporter of football of course. It was a fantastic game. As manager of Real Madrid I have to take consideration that we scored three goals, which is really important. “We didn’t defend well. We can do better. We concede two goals early in the game and then we are able to react really well. We kept the game open until the end. “Now we have a great dream to play the second game in the Bernabeu and we hope to have the chance to go to the final. “The first 20 minutes were really difficult but slowly we were able to come back into the game to keep qualification open.” Manchester City are 90 minutes away from a second successive Champions League Final – but after a breathless, reckless first leg against Real Madrid, who would dare predict the outcome of this tie? Pep Guardiola’s side scored four – and it is no exaggeration to say they could and should have doubled that figure. Real, meanwhile, largely made the most of their chances to stay in touching distance when humiliation, at times, felt inevitable, but may yet regret David Alaba heading wide from close range in the first half. A 4-3 scoreline means this semi-final is deliciously poised for the second leg and next week cannot come soon enough. Click here for James Robson’s full match analysis Somewhat deflated tone from Guardiola, despite his side taking a narrow lead to Madrid. He knows it could have been so much better. Simple message from Guardiola: “We’re going to Madrid to win the game.” Wouldn’t back against them pulling it off. For all Real took advantage of their chances, City could have scored four or five in that first-half. City will be very confident of getting on the scoresheet at the Bernabeu. Kevin de Bruyne 9 Some absolutely vintage football from him as City threatened to run away with it early on. Opened the scoring and then set up Jesus for the second. Foden should have taken advantage of another opening he created, all before half time. Bernardo Silva 8 Picked up spaces that dragged Real around the pitch and further opened them up with his darting movement. No better demonstrated than by his wonderful goal. Phil Foden 9 Scored one and might have had two more. Some absolutely sumptuous touches had Real players chasing shadows. Pure class. James Robson was at the Etihad to rate the City players Bernardo Silva is focusing on the positive despite the obvious frustrations, with City still in a good position going into next week’s second leg in Madrid. “I honestly think for the first 20 minutes we were so, so good,” Silva said. “The way we pressed, the way we controlled the game and created chances. Over the 90 minutes it felt like we could have won by a better score. “Unfortunately we were not able to take advantage of our two-goal differences that we had three times. It is the Champions League, we play one of the best teams in the world. It is still a good result. On to the next game. “It was a good game. Our fans should be proud of us and the work we did. We could have scored more but this football. They took their chances.” ",positive,chelsea

Here’s how <em>Carlo Ancelotti</em>’s side rated at the Etihad... Thibaut Courtois 5 Hardly to blame for any of the first three goals but did not exactly infuse a ragged backline with calmness either. Seemed to switch off expecting a City free-kick when beaten at near post for fourth. Dani Carvajal 5 A real mixed bag. Made important interception on stroke of half-time and in clearing Foden effort off line, but caught napping at back post for at least two of City’s goals. Eder Militao 4 Given the runaround by countryman Jesus and sucked across to him when caught under Fernandinho’s cross for Foden goal. The centrepiece of a backline that looked vulnerable throughout. David Alaba 3 Defied fitness doubt to start but poor decision allowed Jesus to spin him for the second in uncharacteristically frantic display. Did not make it back out after half-time. Ferland Mendy 5 Got an assist for a fairly average cross thanks to Benzema’s brilliance but won’t be happy to have been skinned by 36-year-old Fernandinho for Foden goal. Toni Kroos 5 Might’ve intercepted De Bruyne cross that led to second goal. Lack of mobility exposed at base of midfield without Casemiro holding the fort. Luka Modric 7 Outshone creatively by De Bruyne but won crucial 50/50 in build-up to Benzema goal and still managed to show class. Influence, as against Chelsea, seemed to be growing in second half but replaced soon after fourth City goal. Fede Valverde 5 Dropped into midfield with Casemiro out but within two minutes the Brazilian’s absence was felt as he failed to go with De Bruyne’s run. Supposed to provide legs alongside the two veterans but faced an impossible task against City’s collection of energetic wizards. Rodrygo 5 Anonymous until testing Ederson from tight angle in flurry after Benzema goal. Improved after the break before being subbed with 20 minutes to play as Carlo Ancelotti sought so shore things up. Vinicius Jr. 7 Failed to punish City sloppiness in possession at the back on more than one occasion but came alive when realising Fernandinho mismatch and scored brilliant solo goal after trickery on halfway. Karim Benzema 8 First goal gave Madrid a foothold when they were threatening to be blown away and summed him up: half-a-chance wonderfully put away with a finish few could have executed. Panenka for the second was outrageously cool in circumstances. Substitutes Nacho (Alaba 46’) 6 Replaced an out-of-sorts Alaba and did fine. Eduardo Camavinga (Rodrygo 70’) 5 Sent on to reinforce midfield as Ancelotti seemed to accept a one-goal deficit as a good result but was another whose failure to play to whistle contributed to Bernardo strike. Dani Ceballos (Modric 79’) Marco Asensio (Vincius 88’) Unused: Lunin, Fuidias, Vallejo, Marcelo, Casemiro, Isco, Vasquez, Bale ",positive,chelsea

One of Britain’s richest men launched a last-minute move for the club on Friday, throwing fresh uncertainty over a process that is finally nearing completion. US merchant bank Raine Group were in the process of confirming to the three shortlisted contenders who would be submitted to the Treasury as the successful candidate when Ratcliffe’s £4.25billion offer was revealed. While Boehly is now in a five-day period of exclusive negotiations, Ratcliffe’s bid remains on the table and is still seen by sources close to the process as a viable option. As a result Raine are still to publicly confirm Boehly as their choice to buy out Roman Abramovich. It is believed that an increased offer from Ratcliffe - owner of INEOS - could be enough to blow the process wide open. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has made a last-ditch attempt to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich (Martin Rickett/PA) It is thought he bypassed Raine in making his offer, thus avoiding the complex bidding process set up by the bank. Steve Pagliuca and Sir Martin Broughton were informed on Friday afternoon that their bids had been unsuccessful. Boehly had been the outstanding favourite from the moment the Ricketts family pulled out on the eve of final offers being made. His plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge were among the strongest points of his bid, while he also had the advantage of already carrying out due diligence when previously trying to buy the club. Ratcliffe was also a former suitor and his dramatic insertion into the process could yet have an impact. He has not been told his bid is too late. While Boehly has the chance push through his buyout, the threat of Ratcliffe will leave him aware that there can be no hitches for fear of seeing his rival steal in. In a statement, INEOS said: “This is a British bid, for a British club. We believe that a club is bigger than its owners who are temporary custodians of a great tradition. With responsibility to the fans and the community. “That is why we are committing to spending £1.75bn over 10 years that will be for the direct benefit of the club. We will invest in Stamford Bridge to make it a world-class stadium, befitting of Chelsea FC. This will be organic and on-going so that we will not move away from the home of Chelsea and risk losing the support of loyal fans. “We believe that London should have a club that reflects the stature of the city. One that is held in the same regard as Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich. We intend Chelsea to be that club.” ",positive,chelsea
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-vs-tottenham-top-four-battle-unity-individual-brilliance-b997665.html,Arsenal vs Tottenham: Why top-four battle will come down to unity against individual brilliance as derby looms,"op-four-chasing Arsenal and Tottenham both benefited from playing opponents with one eye on midweek European fixtures on Sunday — but neither will be so fortunate this weekend. Spurs face a daunting trip to quadruple-chasing Liverpool on Saturday evening before Arsenal host Leeds, who have been dragged into the thick of a three-way relegation fight. With a two-point lead over their bitter rivals, fourth-placed Arsenal will be the more comfortable of the two, and this weekend offers them a good chance to open up a five-point gap on Spurs and potentially a cushion going into the north London derby at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Thursday week. But this is merely a scrap for fourth place, quite different to the relentless nature of the title race between Liverpool and Manchester City. Neither Arsenal nor Spurs have shown enough consistency this season to suggest they are certain to win their three other fixtures, so there should be more twists to come. If Spurs have an X-factor, it is their world-class individuals. In head coach Antonio Conte, they have one of the game’s best, while Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester was made comfortable by the brilliance of Harry Kane, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski at one end and Cristian Romero at the other. Arsenal, by contrast, are lacking the same star quality but feel like a more rounded team under Mikel Arteta, further along in their rebuild than their neighbours. Last month, Brighton and Brentford offered a blueprint of how to nullify Conte’s Spurs — specifically, deny them space in the final third and stop Kane getting on the ball — and, in having a more clearly-defined system, Arsenal are harder to stop and better at breaking down stubborn opponents. Arteta is also getting more from his squad than Conte, and important performances from fringe players Mohamed Elneny, Eddie Nketiah and Rob Holding in the wins over Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham point to a united group, with deceptive depth. By contrast, Lucas Moura was hopelessly rusty on his first Spurs start since mid-February on Sunday, while Harry Winks was off the pace in a late cameo, hardly surprisingly given Conte has barely changed his XI for over two months. Both clubs have been impacted by injuries in the same positions, with Spurs losing midfielder Oliver Skipp and wing-back Matt Doherty, and Arsenal without Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney in similar positions. Mikel Arteta vs Antonio Conte - who will win the race for Champions League qualification? The absences may prove crucial in the run-in. In Nuno Tavares, who is deputising for Tierney at left wing-back, Arsenal have an agent of chaos, and while the Portuguese is in the team there is a chance they will drop points in any game. Kulusevski, who came off the bench to twice assist Son on Sunday, should have the beating of Tavares if they both start on May 12. For all their star quality up front, Spurs, though, are weak on both flanks. In the absence of Doherty and Sergio Reguilon, who is sidelined indefinitely with a groin injury, wing-backs Emerson Royal and Ryan Sessegnon failed to make an impact in the final third against Leicester. But it is long past the point where Conte is likely to change his system or experiment on the flanks. If Arsenal allow Spurs’ wing-backs to have the ball, and keep it away from their forwards, they will be in a strong position next week. Spurs finish the season against Burnley, who are likely to be fighting for survival, and already-relegated Norwich, while Arsenal face a tough trip to Newcastle and host Everton on the final day, when the Toffees may also be playing for their Premier League status. The derby will surely be crucial, but the fight for Champions League football could come down to Spurs’ individual brilliance against Arsenal’s collective cohesion and unity. Whatever happens in the next fortnight, expect the contest to go the wire. ",positive,chelsea
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-fc-romelu-lukaku-transfer-news-ac-milan-newcastle-b997605.html,Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku to reject AC Milan and Newcastle interest but Thomas Tuchel frustration growing,"omelu Lukaku will reject any interest from AC Milan this summer, placing fresh uncertainty over his future. The Chelsea striker also has no interest in Newcastle, one of the few teams seen as being able to afford his salary and transfer fee. The Belgium international’s position at Stamford Bridge is under intense scrutiny after being consigned to the fringes by Thomas Tuchel in recent months. He has made only one Premier League start since late February and was an unused substitute in Chelsea’s 1-0 defeat to Everton on Sunday. Lukaku has endured a miserable return to Chelsea after his club-record £97.5million move from Inter Milan last summer. He has struggled to adapt to Tuchel’s system, while injuries have also disrupted his campaign. Meanwhile, his relationship with his manager was strained by his decision to conduct an interview with Italian TV, in which he was critical of Tuchel’s system. While Chelsea’s head coach insisted the situation was resolved, Lukaku has largely been reduced to the role of substitute during the second half of the season. The player is growing increasingly frustrated by his lack of opportunities, with Tuchel’s decision not to use him at Goodison Park - despite being in desperate search of a goal - surprising sources close to Lukaku. It has been noted that he remains Chelsea’s joint second-highest goalscorer this season, despite his lack of starts and injury problems. Tuchel has publicly stated that it is down to Lukaku to prove he can lead his attack and live up to the expectations that accompanied his return to the club. But the German continues to select Kai Havertz ahead of him as a makeshift striker. That raises serious questions about Lukaku’s future, with major doubts over whether he can convince Tuchel to build his attack around him. Milan have emerged as a potential escape route but Lukaku would be reluctant to further upset Inter fans, who he made such an effort to appease with his ill-judged Sky Italia interview. Chelsea know there are few clubs who would be willing to offer them anything like the money they paid for Lukaku, which could block any chance of him moving on this summer. His wages, believed to be around £300,000-a-week, would rule out the vast majority of possible suitors. Romelu Lukaku has only made one Premier League start since February as his Chelsea struggles continue Newly-rich Newcastle were widely seen as one of the few clubs that would not be put off by the financial package required, even though it is unclear if they have any interest. But it is understood Lukaku would not entertain a move to St James’ Park. It remains to be seen what approach Chelsea’s new owners take with the former Manchester United player. While Roman Abramovich has largely been prepared to write off big-money signings, his successor may not. Todd Boehly, who is in exclusive talks to buy the club, has made it clear that he sees sports teams as investment opportunities. It is unlikely he would be comfortable with the most expensive player in the club’s history sitting on the bench. But the American is also believed to want Tuchel at the heart of his Chelsea revolution, which could mean more misery for Lukaku, whose preference is to stay and turn his fortunes around at the club he supported as a boy.

The quadruple-chasing Reds travel to eastern Spain holding a commanding 2-0 lead in their last-four tie after a Pervis Estupinan own goal and Sadio Mane’s second-half effort in a one-sided first leg at Anfield last week. However, manager Jurgen Klopp is not taking anything for granted on the road to Paris, insisting it is a difficult scoreline as Unai Emery pledged to make his side “suffer” in Tuesday’s return clash. Liverpool followed up that dominant win over Villarreal in which they held 73 per cent of the overall possession and allowed only one shot (which was off-target) by triumphing at Newcastle on Saturday, with Naby Keita’s fourth goal of the season in the early Premier League kick-off ensuring they piled the pressure on title rivals Manchester City, who responded with a routine 3-0 victory at Leeds later in the day to regain top spot with four games to go. Much-changed Villarreal, meanwhile, slumped to a disappointing 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Alaves at the weekend, leaving them seventh in LaLiga, four points adrift of the top six and nine behind Atletico Madrid in fourth. Their hopes of playing in Europe at all next season could well now rest on pulling off an incredible comeback against six-time champions Liverpool and winning the whole competition, with either Real Madrid or Manchester City awaiting the winners of this tie in the final at the Stade de France on May 28.

Liverpool will remain without Roberto Firmino on Tuesday, though the Brazilian forward is now back running after nursing a foot issue and is set to travel to Spain with his team-mates. Divock Origi will be assessed after missing the win over Newcastle through non-Covid illness, though Curtis Jones and Kostas Tsimikas are available again. Klopp made five changes in total at St James’ Park, with Mohamed Salah, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ibrahima Konate all moving to the bench. That quintet should return to the starting lineup against Villarreal, though it’s a difficult juggling act with Tottenham visiting Anfield on Saturday evening and the FA Cup Final against Chelsea now less than two weeks away. Mo Salah will return to Liverpool’s starting XI against Villarreal after being rested at Newcastle Klopp is not expecting any players to miss out with a stomach bug that has been in camp of late. Villarreal boss Emery made eight changes of his own against Alaves, with only Samuel Chukwueze, Dani Parejo and Pau Torres retaining their starting berths from Anfield. Former Liverpool full-back Alberto Moreno remains sidelined with a long-term knee injury, but a major boost should come with the return of key striker Gerard Moreno, who sat out the first leg with a hamstring complaint. Raul Albiol and ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin have both shaken off knocks, though Arnaut Danjuma is now struggling with a foot problem after missing training on Monday. Predicted Villarreal XI: Rulli, Foyth, Albiol, Torres, Estupinan, Parejo, Capoue, Coquelin, Lo Celso, Chukwueze, Gerard Predicted Liverpool XI: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Konate, Robertson; Fabinho, Henderson, Thiago; Mane, Salah, Diaz Villarreal’s gameplan totally failed at Anfield, with no shots on target, barely any possession and next to no opportunities to hit on the break. Untroubled Liverpool were entirely comfortable and should unquestionably have won by more as they serenely controlled and dominated proceedings. The wily Emery will have to make big tactical changes for the second leg as they need to put Liverpool under far more pressure from the outset. However, their chances of breaching a mean defence that have now kept four successive clean sheets across all competitions appear slim. Villarreal need to push on and take the initiative in front of their own fans, which will inevitably leave plenty of space in behind for the likes of Salah, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz to exploit. Liverpool to win, 2-0. Villarreal’s only win over Liverpool to date came on home soil back in the first leg of the Europa League semi-finals in 2016, with an injury-time effort from Adrian Lopez. However, the Reds hit back with goals from Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana at Anfield, winning 3-0 to book their place in the Basel showpiece, which they lost to Emery’s Sevilla.

The Brazilian has travelled after resuming running but won’t play at the Estadio de la Ceramica, where Liverpool head holding a commanding two-goal lead courtesy of a dominant first-leg win at Anfield last week. “Bobby is now running, so it’s good,” Klopp said at his pre-match press conference on Monday. “A little strain here in the middle foot bone, so it’s very painful each step. “But he was running today again, will travel with us but will not be involved in the squad yet.

Arsenal are currently sat fourth in the Premier League table, two points ahead of Spurs in fifth with four games left to play this season. The rivals are set to go head to head a week on Thursday (May 12) in a match that is being billed as one of the biggest north London derbies in recent history. Holding admits the Arsenal squad are well aware that game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium will have a huge say on who qualifies for the Champions League, but the centre-back has also urged his team-mates not to allow it to distract them as Leeds visit the Emirates on Sunday. “We have got to take it a game at a time,” Holding told Standard Sport, when asked about the north London derby. “Obviously we have got Leeds at the weekend and that’s always an intense game. “They come and bring energy. It will be a tough game, but we are at home with the fans behind us and we can try to chalk up another three points. Rob Holding has warned Arsenal not to look past Leeds with a crucial north London derby looming “Then the following week on the Thursday we have Tottenham, so that’s what it’ll come down to and it should be a good game.” Arsenal and Tottenham have been neck and neck in the top-four race, and they momentarily swapped places on Sunday after Spurs beat Leicester in the early kick-off. The Gunners responded by defeating West Ham and have now won three games on the spin after initially losing the same number of matches at the start of April. Those wins have come against Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham, with Holding partly putting the turnaround down to Arsenal supporters sticking by the team during a difficult spell. “I think since Mikel [Arteta] has come in there has been a big change in mentality and connecting with the fans,” he said. “I think on Sunday the fans were amazing again and they have been for the last couple of weeks, in terms of away games and at home. “That’s why our results have been decent since those three that we lost. We bounced back and they stuck by us. It could have been an easy point to turn on us, but they stuck by us and we’ve had three good results now.” ",negative,chelsea

Roman Abramovich has already stated that he wants proceeds to go to victims of the war in Ukraine after he was sanctioned over his links to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Mr Johnson is said to want the money to go towards a foundation that will help Ukraine recover from the Russian invasion but there are concerns about the practicalities of setting one up so quickly with such a large budget. Former Arsenal co-owner David Dein has written to the minister for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Nadine Dorries, to urge that £750million is put aside for the game. He wants ministers to use the money to help to build more than 1,000 artificial pitches, improve 20,000 playing surfaces and invest in changing rooms. Dein wrote: “While, to date, the focus has been on the buyers, there is a crucial question of where the proceeds from the sale go. Without question, the victims of the war in Ukraine should be central in our thoughts and anything we can do to use this sale money to support humanitarian efforts should be welcomed."" But he added: ""Investment in coaching, pitches, academies and facilities in deprived and left-behind areas could be game-changing for communities and young people. ""It could help to create a new generation of English football stars while also supporting community cohesion, new jobs, reducing youth crime and helping grow and develop girls' and women's football. These are all cross-government priorities and I hope that Her Majesty's government maybe able to work together to create a game-changing opportunity."" ",positive,chelsea

Last week’s tussle between the respective champions of England and Spain at the Etihad was an instant classic, with early goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus seeing the hosts race into a 2-0 lead inside 11 minutes. City could and should have scored a hatful more before the evergreen Ballon d’Or front-runner Karim Benzema reduced the deficit in trademark fashion, with second-half goals from Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva then sandwiched between a sensational Vinicius Junior effort and followed by an outrageous Benzema Panenka penalty that left a thrilling tie brilliantly poised at 4-3. Despite being ahead, there is a sense of real potential missed opportunity as Pep Guardiola’s Premier League leaders head to the Bernabeu, where Real are typically so dominant, though very nearly came unstuck in humiliating fashion against Chelsea in the quarter-finals. Both sides followed up that unforgettable first leg with thumping 4-0 domestic victories at the weekend - City winning at Leeds to regain top spot from Liverpool and Carlo Ancelotti’s Real celebrating clinching their 35th LaLiga title after a demolition of Espanyol. Either Liverpool or Villarreal await in the final at the Stade de France in Paris on May 28. Real Madrid vs Manchester City is scheduled for an 8pm BST kick-off on Wednesday May 4, 2022. The match will take place at the Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid, Spain. TV channel: The semi-final second leg will be televised live on BT Sport 2 and BT Sport Ultimate, with coverage beginning at 7pm. Live stream: Subscribers will also be able to watch the game online via the BT Sport website or app. Live blog: You can also follow all the action as it unfolds on the night via Standard Sport’s dedicated blog. James Robson will be providing expert analysis from Madrid. City look set to remain without experienced right-back Kyle Walker, who may not play again this season due to an ankle injury suffered in the quarter-final second leg against Atletico Madrid. Defensive colleague John Stones will be assessed after remaining sidelined for the win over Leeds, having limped off last week against Madrid - starting at right-back - in the first half. Guardiola made five changes to his first XI at Elland Road, with Stones, Oleksandr Zinchenko, De Bruyne, Bernardo and Riyad Mahrez replaced by Joao Cancelo, Nathan Ake, Ilkay Gundogan, Jack Grealish and Raheem Sterling. For Madrid, David Alaba is once again facing a race against time to be fit after recovering from a hamstring injury to start in the first leg, only to suffer a setback and go off at half-time. Casemiro is now fully fit, but Eden Hazard remains out as he recovers from an ankle operation and Gareth Bale missed the weekend’s title celebrations with back spasms. Based on the first leg, which was more akin to a basketball match, predicting an exact scoreline between these two attacking powerhouses is a fool’s errand. Last week’s contest was absorbing, chaotic and gloriously eventful, with seven goals scored when in reality it could and should have been well into double figures. City will be kicking themselves that they couldn’t get the job done last week despite their hatfuls of chances, with Real always managing to somehow hang on and prevail in the end. This truly could go either way, but we’re backing Guardiola’s men to narrowly progess in another high-octane affair and book a second consecutive final berth. Man City to win, 3-2.

The Blues slumped to a dismal 1-0 defeat by relegation battlers managed by Frank Lampard at Goodison Park on Sunday after captain Cesar Azpilicueta inexplicably lost the ball to Richarlison, who promptly slotted home what proved to be the winning goal just after half-time. Chelsea were then thwarted by a combination of their own profligacy, the woodwork and an outstanding display from England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford as Everton picked up a vital three points in their fight against relegation from the Premier League and their opponents were left to rue another self-inflicted disappointment. Manager Thomas Tuchel lamented his side’s sudden penchant for critical mistakes, which also cost them against Arsenal last week and in their agonising Champions League quarter-final defeat by Real Madrid. Loftus-Cheek was one of the few Chelsea players to come out of the defeat on Merseyside with any credit, denied a goal by the excellent Pickford and trying to drive his team forward whenever possible on his 50th start for the club. Ruben Loftus-Cheek was one of Chelsea’s few bright lights in their dismal defeat at Everton “We’re all very disappointed,” the 26-year-old told Chelsea’s official website. “Coming into the game we knew it was going to be a hostile atmosphere and it’d be like a final to them. We felt that straight away. “They came out of the blocks second half and caught us napping. We were fighting an uphill battle from then on, the fans were behind them, and it was hard to break them down. It was disappointing. “We’ve made a few mistakes over the past few matches and haven’t kept clean sheets from individual errors. That is how football is, if you keep shooting yourselves in the foot it will be difficult to get out of it.” Chelsea will be desperate to iron out those blunders before they face in-form Liverpool in a domestic cup final for the second time this season at Wembley on May 14. A third defeat in six Premier League games has also loosened their grip further on third place, with resurgent Arsenal now just three points behind and Tottenham five adrift of Chelsea with four matches left to play this term. Asked how Tuchel’s side could go about eradicating those repeated errors, Loftus-Cheek added: “It’s up to us as individuals to tune in and sharpen up as a team together. Getting everyone ready for the game, these are basics in football. “If you don’t have these basics, you will struggle like we have the last four games. This is not Chelsea standard at all. Our concentration levels were not good enough. “We want top four but we cannot perform like that with other teams doing well around us. We need wins. It is hard to process it right now and we will look back at it once the emotions have calmed down. “We had chances to score numerous times. Their keeper made some great saves. If we put them in, I think we could be coming away with a win.” ",positive,chelsea
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/karen-bardsley-retires-england-man-city-goalkeeper-b997480.html,Karen Bardsley: England and Manchester City goalkeeper announces she will retire this summer,"ngland Women and Manchester City goalkeeper Karen Bardsley has announced her decision to retire from professional football this summer. The influential Bardsley, who turns 38 in October, will call time on an impressive career spanning two decades at the end of the current Women’s Super League (WSL) campaign. “It was obviously a pretty tough decision for me to make but, after a lot of deliberation and unfortunately being away from the pitch for quite a while now due to injury, it just felt like it was the right moment,” she said on Monday. “As sad and strange as it is to be stepping away from something I’ve committed my entire young adult life to, ultimately it’s something I feel really proud of and I can honestly say, hand on heart, that I’ve left no stone unturned and I have no regrets about how I’ve applied myself and what I’ve achieved. “I feel incredibly proud of my career but ultimately I’m really excited about the next steps and what is to come in the future, and I’m just very much looking forward to giving back to the football community in many other ways.” SPONSORED The American-born Bardsley has 81 senior England caps to her name, featuring in three World Cups and two European Championships. She also played at London 2012 for Great Britain and was part of Hege Riise’s initial squad for last summer’s delayed Tokyo Olympics, though was forced to withdraw through injury. Bardsley, who played college soccer for the Cal State Fullerton Titans, began her club career in the United States, playing for Ajax America Women, Pali Blues and Sky Blue FC before moving to Europe with Swedish outfit Linköpings. She first arrived in English football with Lincoln in 2013, joining Manchester City a year later ahead of their debut season in the WSL. Bardsley won the WSL title with City in 2016, plus four League Cups and three FA Cups. With the Lionesses, the 37-year-old was a member of the squad that finished third at the 2015 World Cup in Canada, also lifting the Cyprus Cup twice and the SheBelieves Cup in the USA in 2019. Manchester United’s Mary Earps has now established herself as England’s first-choice goalkeeper under Sarina Wiegman ahead of this summer’s delayed home Euros, with competition from Bardsley’s City team-mate Ellie Roebuck and Aston Villa’s Hannah Hampton. City plan to honour Bardsley ahead of Wednesday’s clash with Birmingham, with a trip to Reading then in store before the FA Cup Final clash with Chelsea at Wembley on May 15. They currently sit fourth in the WSL, one point adrift of United in third and with a game in hand on their rivals. “Karen has left an undeniable mark on women’s football, and I believe that her playing career is just the start of the overall impact she will make,” said City head coach Gareth Taylor. “Although injury has limited her appearances on the pitch during my time in charge, she has remained an integral member of our team and has made a real difference behind the scenes. “She deserves all the plaudits that she receives, and I would like to wish her the very best for the future and the next step of her journey.” ",positive,chelsea
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-fc-romelu-lukaku-everton-thomas-tuchel-b997473.html,Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel reveals why Romelu Lukaku did not play at all in shock Everton defeat,"helsea manager Thomas Tuchel has opened up on his decision not to play Romelu Lukaku at all during Sunday’s shock defeat by Everton. The sluggish and weary Blues suffered their third loss in six Premier League games at Goodison Park, with Richarlison’s effort after a key Cesar Azpilicueta error handing Frank Lampard’s side a vital victory in their battle against relegation. It was a disappointing result punctuated by more sloppy individual mistakes and profligacy, both of which are becoming all-too-familiar themes for a Chelsea team that have certainly not been firing on all cylinders since their agonising Champions League quarter-final exit at the hands of Real Madrid last month. Lukaku’s struggles are a major running theme of an inconsistent campaign that has still included two domestic cup finals and Club World Cup glory, with the £97.5million club-record signing having started just one of the last nine matches across all competitions. Prolific in Inter Milan’s Serie A title-winning season last year, the Belgian international has failed to net a Premier League goal since December. Romelu Lukaku was an unused substitute as Chelsea slumped to a shock defeat at Everton Regardless of those ongoing issues, many fans may still have expected Tuchel to turn to Lukaku as his side tried in vain to snatch a late equaliser on Merseyside on Sunday, with third-place Chelsea now just three points ahead of Arsenal with four matches left to play this term. Instead, the German opted to replace Jorginho with midfield colleague Mateo Kovacic at the interval, with wide forwards Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic later introduced at the expense of captain Azpilicueta and ineffective frontman Timo Werner. When quizzed as to why Lukaku did not feature at all against former club Everton, Tuchel insisted he was merely restricted by the number of available substitutions, which will be increased to five per game from next season. He said: “Because we brought Jorginho off. We only had three changes.” ",negative,chelsea
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-rob-holding-mikel-arteta-mohamed-elneny-b997441.html,Arsenal: Unlikely heroes emerge as Mikel Arteta’s young side regain control of Champions League battle,"or much of Arsenal’s season their young players have been centre stage, but this recent revival has seen other unlikely protagonists step forward. After losing to Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton, few would have predicted Arsenal would then beat Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham in quick succession. Nor would many have called that the likes of Eddie Nketiah and Mohamed Elneny would be at the heart of those wins. Against West Ham, it was the turn of Rob Holding to emerge as an unlikely hero as he helped Arsenal battle to a 2-1 win. It was not a great performance from the Gunners and even manager Mikel Arteta described it as “ugly”, but they dug deep to grind out the result and no one embodied that gritty effort more than Holding. The centre-back has been on the periphery this season, playing second fiddle to Ben White and Gabriel and essentially taking on the role of defensive super-sub when Arsenal need to see out a game. ‘Smash glass here in case of emergency’, more or less. For this trip to West Ham, however, Holding was given the chance to start due to White being out injured with a tight hamstring. Holding seized his chance, opening the scoring with a header from a corner before throwing his body on the line as Arsenal held on to their slender lead. “The contribution that he (Holding) is having in terms of minutes is not very noticeable, but the contribution he has for the team is huge,” said Arteta. “He needs some praise. “He is someone like Mo [Elneny]. He is the same type of character, same type of person, that is just humble, just wants to give to the team and is happy with the success. When you ask him to play, he is always ready to do it.” It says a lot about the spirit at Arsenal that Holding and Elneny have barely played this season, but have come in and contributed at the most crucial time. Rob Holding and Mohamed Elneny remain crucial for Arsenal despite a lack of regular games Keeping players happy has not always been easy for Arteta but, even if this slimmed down squad has caused him problems, it has also allowed him to create a greater sense of unity. Holding has played his part in that and it is telling that he is a member of the leadership group, despite not being a regular starter. Off the pitch he has a strong influence in the dressing room and is valued by Arteta, acting as one of his trusted lieutenants. Having a strong first XI is naturally crucial to success, but the role of the squad cannot be overlooked and it has caused issues in the past at Arsenal. Holding’s goal and defensive efforts were pivotal in sealing an important win at West Ham The dressing room has not always been the happiest of places, however it is noticeable now how those on the sidelines seem fully on board, even if they only have limited chances to play. “It’s what it’s been like, Ben and Gabi have been great all year and when I’ve had to come on and try and help us secure the three points it’s vital for us, so to play the full 90 and get the three points is even better,” said Holding. Arsenal’s squad clearly needs strengthening and depth added, but, like last summer, making sure the right characters are signed will be key. In Holding, Arteta has someone who emphatically ticks that box. ",positive,chelsea

Pernille Harder coverted a late penalty to claim a hard-fought three points for Emma Hayes’ side, who sit four points ahead of rivals Arsenal, who have only one game in hand. Earlier on Sunday, Arsenal had romped to a 7-0 win over Aston Villa to ramp up the pressure. Vivianne Miedema scored twice with powerful shots in the opening 13 minutes to send Arsenal in at 2-0 up at the break, and an own goal by Rachel Corsie seven minutes into the second half saw Villa crumble. Beth Mead, Lotte Wubben-Moy and Stina Blackstenius all got on the scoresheet before Parris smacked home a 90th-minute penalty to reach a half-century of league goals in the English top flight as the Gunners climbed to 49 points, one behind Chelsea. Arsenal face Tottenham Hotspur, who play Everton later on Sunday, in midweek before finishing their league campaign away to West Ham, while Chelsea meet Birmingham before taking on Manchester United in their final fixture. Manchester United cruised to a 3-0 win over West Ham United to climb back into third place above Manchester City, who thumped Brighton & Hove Albion 7-2 on Saturday.

Tottenham’s win over Leicester earlier in the day had piled the pressure on Arteta’s side, who kicked-off in fifth place and without key defender Ben White, who missed out with a tight hamstring. In as his replacement, Holding scored the first Premier League goal of his career when he glanced in an opener just after the half-hour mark before Jarrod Bowen’s equaliser. Gabriel would then score a second header as Arsenal saw the game out, moving back above Spurs in a tight Champions League battle. It was another impressive performance from Holding in particular, his second in quick-succession after playing a crucial role in the 4-2 win at Chelsea last month, a result that got Arsenal moving back up the table following a run of three consecutive losses. After the game, Arteta told Sky Sports: “We showed incredible spirit because when we could play the way we wanted to play we had to find a way to play the way they prefer. We adapted. You have to find a way to win all the time to win - forcing mistakes, being brilliant, digging in, clean sheets. “I am really happy, especially for Rob Holding as he hasn’t played the amount of minutes he deserves.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/thomas-tuchel-chelsea-premier-league-top-four-b997416.html,Thomas Tuchel admits Chelsea are ‘never safe’ in top-four race after Everton defeat,"homas Tuchel claims Chelsea are now in a battle to secure top four after just two wins in their last six Premier League games. A 1-0 defeat to Everton continued their shaky end of season form and threatens to drag them back towards to Tottenham and Arsenal in the fight for Champions League places. Tuchel criticised his defence for another costly error that gifted Richarlison the winning goal just after half time. But it was a day when his attack let him down once again – even if it required the brilliance of Jordan Pickford to get Everton over the line. Tuchel said: “I said this many weeks ago that I didn’t feel safe and we are never safe. By the way, if we are in a race for top one, top two or top four, no matter what the race, the last four games to only have four points will never be enough, no matter which race we are in. “We have to take care about ourselves. At the moment we don’t get the points when we play well and deserve more and we lose when we play okay. This is a bad mixture.” Cesar Azpilicueta was caught in possession by Richarlison, who fired the winner at the start of the second half. Tuchel has seen his side dominate possession against Manchester United and Everton in the space of three days, yet his team have only managed one goal and one point from those games. He insists the issue is in defence, not attack. “We knew what was coming and like in the last matches we struggled to have clean sheets,” he said. “In the last four we had one, against West Ham, it is the only win we have and I’m very disappointed. “What can I do? The ball is free, give a goal away, it is the worst thing that can happen to you in this atmosphere. It happens too often. We struggle to play without big mistakes and it is why we struggle to have results.” On his attack he added: “If there is something I can do I will try it, but if I knew about it I would have done it before. “For me the key is to have a clean sheet. Manchester United was a different game. More open, fluid. We finally scored late and conceded straight away. “For me this is more like the game against West Ham and we had a clean sheet and played without any big mistakes and that gives us the chance to score late. “If you install emotion and belief in a stadium like this, you struggle.” Everton fans tried to put Chelsea off by setting off fireworks outside the Liverpool Hilton hotel where they stayed on Saturday night. Tuchel said they did not affect him. “I personally woke up twice at 1am and 3am for one minute and after the noise. I turned around and kept on sleeping.” ",positive,chelsea
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-fc-pickford-everton-b997412.html,Magnificent Jordan Pickford display no excuse for Chelsea in latest lacklustre performance,"f not for Jordan Pickford, Chelsea would have won this match. But while the England goalkeeper was in Superman mode, it would be letting Thomas Tuchel’s side off the hook to suggest he was the overriding reason for Everton’s crucial 1-0 win. As inspired as he was, Chelsea were abject. They slept-walked through the first half at Goodison Park, stumbled into the traps Frank Lampard set – and, ultimately, got what they deserved. Absolutely nothing. Cesar Azpilicueta’s error at the start of the second half was seized on by Richarlison and may go a long way towards the Toffees’ Premier League survival. The roar from the home crowd that greeted every challenge won, every heroic moment from Pickford, and the final whistle - underlining just how significant a result this was. As for Chelsea, they felt ill-prepared for the fight they were in for, but – most worryingly for Tuchel – ill-prepared to capitalise on the dominance of the ball Lampard was clearly happy to concede. Chelsea’s manager simply must address this glaring weakness in his team if he is to have any hope of closing the gap to Manchester City and Liverpool next season. In back-to-back games in the North West this week – against Manchester United and Everton – they have bossed possession and chances created and walked away with one goal and one point from a possible six. That is not good enough for any team with realistic ambitions of the title. Which is why his claim that his defence is his biggest concern after these latest dropped points, may not sit too well with supporters. “If there is something I can do, I will try it, but if I knew about it I would have done it before,” Tuchel said. “For me the key is to have a clean sheet. The issue is that we don’t have enough clean sheets.” The ongoing lack of cohesion in his forward line, as well as lack of precision, has cost Chelsea too often this season and their manager cannot turn a blind eye to it. At this point it feels as much to do with personnel as the coaching. This is a problem that has been in place since Tuchel took charge 15 months ago, with the list of strikers who have failed to produce at the point of his attack stretching from Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud to Timo Werner and Romelu Lukaku. With Chelsea desperate for a goal with more than 20 minutes to go, Tuchel left £97.5million record signing Lukaku on the bench. That speaks volumes about the Belgian’s future – but also points to his manager’s failure to get a tune out of him. If a new centre forward is recruited this summer, would there be any confidence that he would thrive where a growing list of others have not? But it is not only the cutting edge. Where is Chelsea’s guile around the box to open up deep-lying defences? They too often rely on the width of Reece James or the injured Ben Chilwell - missing the sort of incisive, intricate football City and Liverpool produce. Mason Mount, deployed as a No10 again, is energetic, but at times his side need craft over graft. These are all areas Tuchel must look at if his side are to find another dimension. It was not until the second half, with Chelsea a goal behind and fortunate not to be two-down that they finally awoke from their slumber. Unfortunately for them, Pickford’s concentration levels were sharp despite his inaction. First the he tipped Mount’s effort from inside the box onto the post, with the ball rolling across to hit the other upright. From the rebound, Azpilicueta fired goalwards, but Pickford was there again to block. Moments later he was flying at the feet of Toni Rudiger to deny the Chelsea from close range – albeit with his face. He would not be beaten. Ruben Loftus-Cheek – one of Chelsea’s few players to try to open Everton up – struck from distance, only for Pickford to get a hand on it again. Even deep into stoppage time, substitute Mateo Kovacic was denied an equaliser when the keeper dived low to claw away from the bottom corner. Pickford celebrated every save like it was a goal – and so did the crowd. Chelsea’s fans, meanwhile, were given nothing to cheer. ",positive,chelsea

The first half consisted primarily of Chelsea possession and fouls. Five of a total eight yellow cards were handed out in the first 45 minutes, two of which came Cesar Azpilicueta and Seamus Coleman’s way after the captains tussled over a foul committed by Mason Mount, which also earned a booking. It was Azpilicueta who, moments after the restart, surrendered possession by his own penalty area for the opening goal. Demarai Gray slipped in Richarlison to bury the opener and send Goodison Park into raptures, matching the big-game atmosphere present all weekend on Merseyside as fireworks set off outside the Chelsea hotel overnight were followed by flares welcoming the home team bus into the stadium. Vitalii Mykolenko squandered a great chance for 2-0 immediately afterwards, firing over from close range, before Jordan Pickford came to Everton’s rescue. Mason Mount hit the post with a half-volley from outside the box, which rolled agonisingly along the goalline. Azpilicueta arrived on the scene to have a rebound stunningly denied by the keeper, who got up to save Antonio Rudiger’s point-blank effort from the subsequent corner with his face. With seven minutes of added time, Pickford again produced heroics to deny Mateo Kovacic after the midfielder wriggled free deep in the Everton box. The win leaves the Toffees just two points off safety with a game in hand on Burnley and Leeds. ",positive,chelsea

Cesar Azpilicueta surrendered possession on the edge of his own box to allow the Toffees to take the lead, as they took three points in the fight for survival. It was a scrappy performance from the Blues, who fell to defeat away from home for the first time since January. James Robson was at Goodison Park to give his verdict on the visiting players... Edouard Mendy - 6 Had very little to do – but could not keep out Richarlison’s strike. Let down by Azpilicueta on that occasion. Cesar Azpilicueta - 5 Took his eye off the ball and Chelsea paid as Richarlison struck. Typical of a performance when he seemed more interested in getting into arguments than concentrating on his job. Thiago Silva - 6 Felt like the only Chelsea defender not to lose his head on as when they allowed themselves to be frustrated by Everton. Antonio Rudiger - 6 Booked early on and had to walk a tightrope afterwards. Still as physical as you would expect, but there were some heart in mouth moments. Reece James - 6 After his brilliant performance at Old Trafford, there was a sense of him wanting to do too much on occasion here. At times he could have kept it simple as was caught as a result. Still one of Chelsea’s most threatening players. Jorginho - 4 Chelsea needed him to be more dynamic. His one-paced display typified the lack of urgency in his side’s first-half offering. Ruben Loftus-Cheek - 6 Chelsea’s best moments of a dour first half came from his bursts through midfield. One of the few players in yellow to try to open Everton up. Marcos Alonso - 6 He had more reason than most to pile the misery on Lampard after the break down of their relationship at Chelsea. Pushed high to give Chelsea an outlet on the left. Mason Mount - 6 So close to scoring. Not short of endeavour, but in that No10 role he needs to produce a bit more craft to got along with the graft. Timo Werner - 5 Largely ineffective. Got himself into some decent areas, but never did anything with those opportunities. Kai Havertz - 6 Worked hard and it was clear how he was trying to get between the lines of Everton’s defence. Did not look like scoring. Substitutes Mateo Kovacic (Jorginho, 46) - 6 Brought a bit more drive to Chelsea’s midfield to try to break Everton out of their comfortable shape. Christian Pulisic (Azpilicueta, 68) - 4 Struggled much like the rest of Chelsea’s forwards. Hakim Ziyech (Werner, 68) - 5 Produced the odd threatening cross. Not a lot else. Subs unused: Kepa, Chalobah, Sarr, Saul, Kenedy, Lukaku. ",positive,chelsea

Celtic took a giant step towards clinching the Scottish Premiership title with an absorbing 1-1 draw against Old Firm rivals Rangers at Parkhead. The visitors, beaten 1-0 by RB Leipzig in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final in Germany on Thursday night, started positively and could have taken the lead through Ryan Kent when he missed a good chance. But in the 20th minute Portuguese attacker Jota volleyed past Gers goalkeeper Allan McGregor from close range. Striker Fashion Sakala levelled in the 68th minute with a powerful drive, and struck the post late on when clean through as he failed to take a massive opportunity. The draw keeps Rangers six points behind the Hoops with only three fixtures remaining - and with Celtic having a superior goal difference of 19 it would take a notable and unlikely turnaround to keep the title at Ibrox.

Abada looks to have the Rangers half to himself, but Diallo gets back and pulls him to the ground. Yellow card. Breathless finish to this match. 86 mins: RANGERS HIT THE POST! What. A. Chance. Sakala had to win it for his side, won’t get a better chance than that. He was clean through, slid it past Hart at the near post but it cannons back off the post. 85 mins: AND THAT’S BRILLIANT FROM HART! All is forgiven. Rangers break away on the right with Wright who is far too quick for Starfelt. Cuts it back, Arfield flicks it at goal... Hart sticks a big hand out. Makes the save from the rebound too. Big moment in the match. 83 mins: What a mess from Joe Hart. Takes an age to move with the ball at his feet... and then just falls over. Kicks it straight to Kent, but fortunately for the goalkeeper Rangers can’t take advantage. 81 mins: Celtic have taken a bit more control now, would have to say they probably look the more likely to find a winner. Not a huge amount of space on offer for either side though. As it stands, it’s a point that Celtic will be more than happy with. 78 mins: Yellow card starting to put a serious shift in. Kent the latest addition to the book as he’s penalised for a high boot. Maeda off, Abada on for Celtic for the final 15 minutes or so. 77 mins: Giakoumakis with an unnecessary challenge, not his first since coming on. He’s earned a yellow card for it too.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-sir-jim-ratcliffe-bid-owner-b997180.html,Chelsea: Sir Jim Ratcliffe makes sensational late bid to buy club with £4.25billion offer,"ir Jim Ratcliffe, owner of petrochemical giant Ineos, has made a sensational last-gasp bid to buy Chelsea. Ratcliffe, one of Britain’s richest men, has been linked with a takeover of Chelsea in the past but only last month a spokesperson dismissed reports he could succeed Roman Abramovich. The race to buy the club following the sanctioning of Russian billionaire Abramovich had been whittled down to three contenders, with consortiums headed by former Liverpool chairman Sir Michael Broughton, LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly and Steve Pagliuca, who co-owns the Boston Celtics, left in the running after a fourth prospective owner - the Ricketts family - pulled out. The process had been nearing its conclusion, with a preferred buyer due to be announced but 69-year-old Ratcliffe revealed to The Times that he had submitted a late offer to US merchant bank Raine Group - who are overseeing the sale - on Friday morning worth more than £4billion, having held talks with Blues chairman Bruce Buck yesterday. An Ineos statement confirmed: “Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Chairman of INEOS, has made a formal bid for Chelsea FC, for £4.25bn. £2.5bn is committed to the Charitable Trust to support victims of the war, with £1.75bn committed to investment directly into the club over the next 10 years. “This is a British bid, for a British club. We believe that a club is bigger than its owners who are temporary custodians of a great tradition. With responsibility to the fans and the community. That is why we are committing to spending £1.75bn over 10 years that will be for the direct benefit of the club. We will invest in Stamford Bridge to make it a world-class stadium, befitting of Chelsea FC. This will be organic and on-going so that we will not move away from the home of Chelsea and risk losing the support of loyal fans.” Ratcliffe already has significant experience in sport, currently the owner of Ligue 1 side OGC Nice and Tour de France-winning cycling team Ineos Grenadiers. Ineos are also principal sponsors of Formula One world champions Mercedes and sailing’s Ineos Team UK. Their statement continued: “We will continue to invest in the team to ensure we have a first class squad of the world’s greatest players, coaches and support staff, in the men’s and women’s games. “And we hope to continue to invest in the academy to provide opportunity for talented youngsters to develop into first class players. We believe that London should have a club that reflects the stature of the city. One that is held in the same regard as Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich. We intend Chelsea to be that club. “We are making this investment as fans of the beautiful game – not as a means to turn a profit. We do that with our core businesses. The club is rooted in its community and its fans. And it is our intention to invest in Chelsea FC for that reason.” ",positive,chelsea

Following the deadline for offers to take over the Premier League giants from Roman Abramovich, a trio of official bids had landed before it emerged on Friday that Boehly had been given the go-ahead to complete a deal. Sir Jim Ratcliffe had entered the running late on as a surprise fourth party interested in buying the Blues for £4.25billion before it was confirmed that Steven Pagliuca’s bid had failed. Rivalling Boehly is an offer fronted by former British Airways chief Sir Martin Broughton, with backing from the likes of Formula One legend Sir Lewis Hamilton and tennis superstar Serena Williams. But the American’s consortium appear set to seal the takeover with funding coming from Boehly, fellow Dodgers co-owner Mark Walters and Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss. Reports suggest they will now have up to a week to finalise an exclusivity agreement for their £3.5bn-plus takeover. All bids included significant investment in renovating Stamford Bridge and property developer Jonathan Goldstein has already been enlisted by the Boehly to help oversee the project.

However, manager Jurgen Klopp is not taking anything for granted on the road to Paris, insisting it is a difficult scoreline as Unai Emery pledged to make his side “suffer” in Tuesday’s return clash. Liverpool followed up that dominant win over Villarreal in which they held 73 per cent of the overall possession and allowed only one shot (which was off-target) by triumphing at Newcastle on Saturday, with Naby Keita’s fourth goal of the season in the early Premier League kick-off ensuring they piled the pressure on title rivals Manchester City, who responded with a routine 3-0 victory at Leeds later in the day to regain top spot with four games to go.

Villarreal boss Emery made eight changes of his own against Alaves, with only Samuel Chukwueze, Dani Parejo and Pau Torres retaining their starting berths from Anfield. Former Liverpool full-back Alberto Moreno remains sidelined with a long-term knee injury, but a major boost should come with the return of key striker Gerard Moreno, who sat out the first leg with a hamstring complaint. Raul Albiol and ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin have both shaken off knocks, though Arnaut Danjuma is now struggling with a foot problem after missing training on Monday.

Untroubled Liverpool were entirely comfortable and should unquestionably have won by more as they serenely controlled and dominated proceedings. The wily Emery will have to make big tactical changes for the second leg as they need to put Liverpool under far more pressure from the outset. However, their chances of breaching a mean defence that have now kept four successive clean sheets across all competitions appear slim. Villarreal need to push on and take the initiative in front of their own fans, which will inevitably leave plenty of space in behind for the likes of Salah, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz to exploit. Liverpool to win, 2-0. Villarreal’s only win over Liverpool to date came on home soil back in the first leg of the Europa League semi-finals in 2016, with an injury-time effort from Adrian Lopez.

A 4-0 win over Espanyol over Saturday sealed La Liga glory for Real to ensure that Ancelotti has won the league in his first season back at the Bernabeu. A draw would have been good enough, but Rodrygo netted twice and Marco Asensio and Karim Benzema also got on the scoresheet to get the job done in style. The Italian left Real back in 2015 after three years in charge in which he was unable to lead them to the title. It’s the latest in a long line of trophies that he has lifted. Ancelotti won Serie A in 2004 when he was managing AC Milan and then sealed Premier League glory in 2010 as Chelsea boss. His time at PSG saw him win Ligue 1 in 2013, before leading Bayern Munich to the league title in 2017. Ancelotti will be hoping there is even more success to come for him this season, with Champions League glory still a possibility. “I’m very proud of this,” Ancelotti said. “I’ve had a very long season, but I’m still enjoying it.” “Now I’m with Real Madrid, and to win with Real Madrid is very special. “This is the first time for me to win a title at the (Santiago) Bernabeu, and the atmosphere here is special.” It’s a 35th La Liga triumph for Real Madrid, with the players marking it after the match by throwing Ancelotti up in the air. He did not want the fun to stop. “I told Marcelo that I wanted to keep going,” Ancelotti joked. “I was enjoying being up there in the air.” Along with Bob Paisley and Zinedine Zidane, Ancelotti has won the European Cup or Champions League on three occasions as a manager, with two of those coming when it charge at AC Milan and the third in 2014 when Real lifted the trophy for a tenth time. Champions League success this season would see him break that managerial record, though there is a tough task ahead. Real have a one-goal deficit to overcome on Wednesday night, after losing 4-3 to Manchester City in the first leg, though the Spanish side have already knocked out PSG and Chelsea this season despite not being at their best.

Sancho remains absent for tonight’s Premier League visit of Brentford to Old Trafford due to tonsilitis, having also sat out Thursday’s 1-1 draw against Chelsea. And Rangnick believes the England winger could stay on the sidelines for all of United’s final three outings this term. “As it seems, Jadon might be out for the rest of the season with his tonsillitis so he will most likely be not available against Brentford,” the German said. “Since the last game is another three weeks to go against Crystal Palace, but for the next two games I think it is unlikely. SPONSORED “He definitely has an inflammation on his tonsils and has also had some high temperatures, that’s why he was not available for Chelsea and he almost certainly won’t be available for the next couple of games. ”So, hopefully, they can get hold of that inflammation and if the tonsils have to be taken out and removed, this can happen at the end of the season.” Harry Maguire, Paul Pogba and Luke Shaw remain out for United against Brentford, although Edinson Cavani is fit enough for the bench, alongside Fred.

Firmino has missed the last four games - including last week’s initial clash - with a foot strain. The Brazilian has travelled after resuming running but won’t play at the Estadio de la Ceramica, where Liverpool head holding a commanding two-goal lead courtesy of a dominant first-leg win at Anfield last week. “Bobby is now running, so it’s good,” Klopp said at his pre-match press conference on Monday. “A little strain here in the middle foot bone, so it’s very painful each step. “But he was running today again, will travel with us but will not be involved in the squad yet.

You would expect that quintet to return to the first XI at Villarreal, with Joe Gomez, Joel Matip, James Milner, match-winner Naby Keita and Diogo Jota quickly swapping back out.

The quadruple-chasing Reds travel to eastern Spain holding a commanding 2-0 lead in their last-four tie after a Pervis Estupinan own goal and Sadio Mane’s second-half effort in a one-sided first leg at Anfield last week. However, manager Jurgen Klopp is not taking anything for granted on the road to Paris, insisting it is a difficult scoreline as Unai Emery pledged to make his side “suffer” in Tuesday’s return clash. Liverpool followed up that dominant win over Villarreal in which they held 73 per cent of the overall possession and allowed only one shot (which was off-target) by triumphing at Newcastle on Saturday, with Naby Keita’s fourth goal of the season in the early Premier League kick-off ensuring they piled the pressure on title rivals Manchester City, who responded with a routine 3-0 victory at Leeds later in the day to regain top spot with four games to go. Much-changed Villarreal, meanwhile, slumped to a disappointing 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Alaves at the weekend, leaving them seventh in LaLiga, four points adrift of the top six and nine behind Atletico Madrid in fourth.

Divock Origi will be assessed after missing the win over Newcastle through non-Covid illness, though Curtis Jones and Kostas Tsimikas are available again. Klopp made five changes in total at St James’ Park, with Mohamed Salah, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ibrahima Konate all moving to the bench.

Mo Salah will return to Liverpool’s starting XI against Villarreal after being rested at Newcastle Klopp is not expecting any players to miss out with a stomach bug that has been in camp of late. Villarreal boss Emery made eight changes of his own against Alaves, with only Samuel Chukwueze, Dani Parejo and Pau Torres retaining their starting berths from Anfield. Former Liverpool full-back Alberto Moreno remains sidelined with a long-term knee injury, but a major boost should come with the return of key striker Gerard Moreno, who sat out the first leg with a hamstring complaint. Raul Albiol and ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin have both shaken off knocks, though Arnaut Danjuma is now struggling with a foot problem after missing training on Monday. Predicted Villarreal XI: Rulli, Foyth, Albiol, Torres, Estupinan, Parejo, Capoue, Coquelin, Lo Celso, Chukwueze, Gerard Predicted Liverpool XI: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Konate, Robertson; Fabinho, Henderson, Thiago; Mane, Salah, Diaz Villarreal’s gameplan totally failed at Anfield, with no shots on target, barely any possession and next to no opportunities to hit on the break. Untroubled Liverpool were entirely comfortable and should unquestionably have won by more as they serenely controlled and dominated proceedings. The wily Emery will have to make big tactical changes for the second leg as they need to put Liverpool under far more pressure from the outset. However, their chances of breaching a mean defence that have now kept four successive clean sheets across all competitions appear slim. Villarreal need to push on and take the initiative in front of their own fans, which will inevitably leave plenty of space in behind for the likes of Salah, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz to exploit. Liverpool to win, 2-0. Villarreal’s only win over Liverpool to date came on home soil back in the first leg of the Europa League semi-finals in 2016, with an injury-time effort from Adrian Lopez. However, the Reds hit back with goals from Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana at Anfield, winning 3-0 to book their place in the Basel showpiece, which they lost to Emery’s Sevilla.

Spurs will consider offers for Bergwijn this month but want to recoup closer to the £27m they paid PSV Eindhoven for the winger two years ago. Bergwijn, 24, was the first permanent signing of Jose Mourinho's tenure in January 2020 but could be the first departure under Antonio Conte, if Ajax return with a sufficiently improved offer. Bergwijn, who was born in Amsterdam, came through the ranks at Ajax before joining their rivals PSV in 2011, and is thought to be open to a return to the Eredivisie champions after two frustrating years in the Premier League. Spurs, however, would be reluctant to allow Bergwijn to leave until they have signed a replacement, particularly with Heung-min Son currently sidelined with a hamstring injury until at least the end of the month. Bergwijn made an impressive start at Spurs, scoring in his first three home league games including stunners against both Manchester clubs, but he has since struggled for confidence and fitness. He scored just once last season and opened his account for this term in December's 2-1 win over West Ham in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals, also assisting Lucas Moura's winner. Tottenham will allow Dutch winger Steven Bergwijn to leave the club this month His display earned praise from Conte, who has raised the possibility of Bergwijn deputising for Harry Kane up front when the England captain needs a rest. Bergwijn has not played since Boxing Day due to a calf injury but Conte said before Sunday's 3-1 win over Morecambe he expected to welcome back the Dutch international ""very soon"". Quizzed on Bergwijn’s future at a press conference held before the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg against Chelsea, Conte said: “Honestly, Bergwijn he knows very well what I think about him. I consider him a player that can play in all three roles. As a No9 and as a No10. “For sure, in my period at Tottenham, he was injured for a long time but I showed him that when he’s in a good physical condition, I gave him a chance to show he’s a good player. For sure, Bergwijn is a Tottenham player and he’s very close to coming back. “After the game against Chelsea, he can start having training sessions with us. I count on him. He’s a player with different characteristics to Sonny, Lucas and Harry. He’s very good 1v1, he’s a creative player that we don’t have in our squad.” ",positive,chelsea

Emma Hayes’ side were not at their best against Spurs but Beth England and Kerr’s goals, either side of Kerys Harrop equalising for Spurs, secured them a vital 2-1 win. It means Chelsea are now four points clear of Arsenal at the top of the WSL with two matches to go, although the Gunners have a game in hand. “They (Tottenham) have taken big points off big clubs this year, so we knew it wasn’t going to be easy,” said Kerr. “They’re a good team so it does feel like a good three points, but any win is an important win now. There are two games to go and we’re just going to grind through. If we get all six points we’re champions.” Chelsea’s win last night has put pressure on Arsenal, who are trying to catch the Blues in the final stretch. They have a game in hand on Hayes’ side, which is next Wednesday when they host Tottenham at Emirates Stadium, but before that they will take on Aston Villa on Sunday. Chelsea, meanwhile, are travelling to bottom of the table Birmingham. “We’re in the title race and fighting to be champions. Last season the team was fighting to get third place,” said Arsenal boss Jonas Eidevall. “It’s much more fun to be fighting for the title and if anyone had told us that before the season we would’ve taken it, so let’s enjoy it.” Arsenal will play before Chelsea on Sunday, kicking off at 2pm and four hours earlier than the Blues in the evening. “We just have to control what we can do and get the three points each game and we’re praying Chelsea slip up,” Beth Mead added.

Striker Fashion Sakala levelled in the 68th minute with a powerful drive, and struck the post late on when clean through as he failed to take a massive opportunity. The draw keeps Rangers six points behind the Hoops with only three fixtures remaining - and with Celtic having a superior goal difference of 19 it would take a notable and unlikely turnaround to keep the title at Ibrox.

A really entertaining conclusion to the match, which finishes level. Celtic will take that - they have a six-point lead with three matches remaining. Fashion Sakala got the equaliser and very nearly had the winner late on, but the woodwork denied him and Rangers. 90 mins: Abada has the ball in the back of the net, but the flag has long been up for offside. It is absolute chaos at Celtic Park. Just two minutes added on. 88 mins: Corner for Rangers, it’s cleared and Celtic are on the break. Abada looks to have the Rangers half to himself, but Diallo gets back and pulls him to the ground. Yellow card. Breathless finish to this match. 86 mins: RANGERS HIT THE POST! What. A. Chance. Sakala had to win it for his side, won’t get a better chance than that. He was clean through, slid it past Hart at the near post but it cannons back off the post. 85 mins: AND THAT’S BRILLIANT FROM HART! All is forgiven. Rangers break away on the right with Wright who is far too quick for Starfelt. Cuts it back, Arfield flicks it at goal... Hart sticks a big hand out. Makes the save from the rebound too. Big moment in the match. 83 mins: What a mess from Joe Hart. Takes an age to move with the ball at his feet... and then just falls over. Kicks it straight to Kent, but fortunately for the goalkeeper Rangers can’t take advantage. 81 mins: Celtic have taken a bit more control now, would have to say they probably look the more likely to find a winner. Not a huge amount of space on offer for either side though. As it stands, it’s a point that Celtic will be more than happy with. 78 mins: Yellow card starting to put a serious shift in. Kent the latest addition to the book as he’s penalised for a high boot. Maeda off, Abada on for Celtic for the final 15 minutes or so. 77 mins: Giakoumakis with an unnecessary challenge, not his first since coming on. He’s earned a yellow card for it too. He’s certainly been keen to make an impact, you have to give him that! ",positive,chelsea

The American flew in for face-to-face talks with the club on Thursday, with prospective buyers making their final pitches this week, but has been told he will not be presented to the Treasury as a preferred bidder by US merchant bank, Raine Group, who are overseeing the sale process. The news comes on the day Sir Jim Ratcliffe, one of Britain’s richest men, confirmed he had launched a late £4.25bn bid to buy out Roman Abramovich. The owner of INEOS is hoping to hijack a sale that was nearing conclusion, with Todd Boehly and Sir Martin Broughton now battling it out for ownership. In a statement, INEOS said: “Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Chairman of INEOS, has made a formal bid for Chelsea FC, for £4.25bn. £2.5bn is committed to the Charitable Trust to support victims of the war, with £1.75bn committed to investment directly into the club over the next 10 years. SPONSORED “This is a British bid, for a British club. We believe that a club is bigger than its owners who are temporary custodians of a great tradition. With responsibility to the fans and the community. “That is why we are committing to spending £1.75bn over 10 years that will be for the direct benefit of the club. “We will invest in Stamford Bridge to make it a world-class stadium, befitting of Chelsea FC. This will be organic and on-going so that we will not move away from the home of Chelsea and risk losing the support of loyal fans. “We will continue to invest in the team to ensure we have a first class squad of the world’s greatest players, coaches and support staff, in the men’s and women’s games. “And we hope to continue to invest in the academy to provide opportunity for talented youngsters to develop into first class players. “We believe that London should have a club that reflects the stature of the city. One that is held in the same regard as Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich. We intend Chelsea to be that club. “We are making this investment as fans of the beautiful game – not as a means to turn a profit. We do that with our core businesses.“The club is rooted in its community and its fans. And it is our intention to invest in Chelsea FC for that reason.” ",positive,chelsea

All three shortlisted bidders have been invited to make final pitches as US merchant bank Raine Group prepares to put forward a preferred buyer to the Treasury. Todd Boehly’s consortium have already held talks at Stamford Bridge and Sir Martin Broughton is also due to run through his proposals one last time. There is hope among the candidates that the process will come to an end this week, although they are still to be given any guidance by Raine over time frames. There is an acceptance that the speed with which the takeover has had to be conducted – due to the UK Government sanctioning Abramovich over his links to Vladimir Putin – has meant for the shifting of parameters. Shortlisted bidders are making their final pitches in the race to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich Raine has asked a series of “comfort questions” and demanded a commitment from each bidder not to sell the club for 10 years. They have also asked for £1billion-worth of investment on top of the sale to ensure the ongoing success of the club. The final pitches have been described by sources close to the process as a normal part of the procedure, even after representatives from each consortium met with members of Chelsea’s executive before submitting official offers earlier this month. Pagliuca is due to fly into London today and head to Stamford Bridge. The co-owner of the NBA’s Boston Celtics has been the lowest key of the remaining candidates, with his interest in the club not known until late in the bidding process. Among the strongest elements of his bid is his partner Larry Tanenbaum’s construction expertise. Plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge are seen as a major factor in who will eventually be put forward to buy the club. ",positive,chelsea

Among them have been assurances that any prospective new owner vows not to sell the club for 10 years. The three remaining candidates have been asked a host of follow-up queries, even after submitting final offers earlier this month. There is an acceptance that the speed of the process – due to the sanctioning of Roman Abramovich – has led to a number of details needing to be ironed out on an ongoing basis. But it is understood Abramovich wants to be assured the next owners will commit to Chelsea for the next decade. That follows his insistence that £1billion be committed on top of the sale fee for continued investment in the first team, stadium and development throughout the club. Raine is deciding between consortiums led by Todd Boehly, Sir Martin Broughton and Steve Pagliuca. All three plan to commit to the long-awaited redevelopment of Stamford Bridge. Bidders were readying themselves for news last week and are hopeful that the process of narrowing the field down to one will be completed in the coming days. But they continue to be kept waiting by Raine. Meanwhile, Chelsea legend Paul Canoville has given his backing to Boehly to take over, claiming the addition of Sir Lewis Hamilton and Serena Williams to Broughton’s consortium is not enough to get his support. Canoville, who has spoken to all three bidders, said Boehly won him over with his “huge passion for social impact around community outreach”. ",positive,chelsea

Canoville, who was invited by the club to join talks with prospective buyers in the takeover race, suggested both Hamilton and Serena Williams should steer clear of involvement. Last week, it emerged both the F1 and tennis stars would pledge futher funds to a bid spearheaded by Sir Martin Broughton. For Canoville, however, Hamilton being an Arsenal fan and the fact Williams has previously said she supports Real Madrid means they should not focus on Chelsea. “Lewis is an Arsenal fan and that’s a fact,” he wrote in a lengthy tweet. “Serena is on record saying she supports Real Madrid”. “I will always support Lewis in everything he does in F1, he is the greatest driver ever in my opinion,” said Canoville. “And, as with Serena, he is a phenomenal icon for black achievement and civil rights.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/aleksandar-mitrovic-fulham-premier-league-championship-b991890.html,Premier League flop? Flat-track bully? Why Aleksandar Mitrovic is now a different animal,"leksandar Mitrovic has long been considered too good for the Championship, but this season the Fulham striker has taken his dominance of the division to a whole new level. The Serb has notched 35 goals this term and has already smashed the record for the most scored in a Championship campaign, set only last season by Brentford’s Ivan Toney, The Serbian international also has a World Cup to look forward to later this year, but having broken Toney’s record with 14 games to spare - and with nine still to go - the focus is on getting to 40 goals and the Premier League. The Fulham striker set the record for the fewest number of games to reach 20 goals in the Championship having hit that mark after just 17 appearances, while he now has the best minutes-per-goal average since the break-up of the old Football League in 1992, scoring once every 119 minutes. The tale has long gone that the 27-year-old has always been too good for the Championship and not good enough for the Premier League (much like Fulham) and many have been quick to put this sensational season down simply to the fact that he is back in the second tier following relegation last season - but he has more quality than that. “I think he’s a player who could play for a top club,” former manager Slavisa Jokanovic, who signed Mitrovic from Newcastle in 2018, tells Standard Sport. “He could be someone like [Romelu] Lukaku or [Olivier] Giroud, but he’s not a player who can play on the counter-attack. “He needs to be in a team that dominates games and gets him in the box, he needs to be in and around the opposition’s box. I think that’s the key to the difference in his performance levels in the Championship and the Premier League. He needs to be in a team that plays to his qualities.” Those who work with and watch Mitrovic closely will tell you he is a completely different animal this season. Manager Marco Silva has made training more regimented and turned Fulham into a far fitter side that can attack on a more consistent basis throughout games than under his predecessor, Scott Parker. Mitrovic had essentially been ostracised under Parker and would have left the club were it not for his departure in the summer. The striker has now been given far more freedom to roam the forward line in a team which sets up more chances for him and vice versa. Fans feel they got the better side of the deal when Mitrovic stayed at Craven Cottage and Parker departed. Not only do they have a striker scoring more than anyone before him in the Championship, but Mitrovic now has more assists (seven) than he has ever managed in a single season thanks to Silva’s system and his determination. That hard work is something not many fans witness. During his early days at Newcastle, Mitrovic developed a reputation for being somewhat hotheaded, something he was keen to quash when arriving in west London. “He’s extremely professional and very hard-working,” says Jokanovic. “He came to Fulham wanting to succeed. “I never had any problems with him. In fact, when he joined, he said to me: ‘Boss, I’m not going to do anything crazy.’ When we started to train, you could instantly tell that he was a top player with real quality.” His desire to improve is not fading, either. “I have known him since playing in Belgium, he has always been a goalscorer but he has improved and scores even more,” teammate Neeskens Kebano told Standard Sport. “In the game he is very important for us, he allows us to go up the pitch and holds the ball up very well. “He releases it to the wings or even to a No8 or 6. Now he has added running into the space and is improving again. “He is in great shape too.” Fitness has been a key factor in Mitrovic’s development. Silva has improved this across the board but the former Newcastle United man has been working with a private personal trainer who also counts Chelsea duo Reece James and Ruben Loftus-Cheek among his clients. Mitrovic sets himself targets in five goal bursts. He raced to 20, through 25, 30 and now to 35. This weekend’s opponents QPR may take solace from the fact he has not scored in the last two games, but he has not gone three league games without a goal all season. It is all coming together and Mitrovic is hitting new heights in a system that is better suited to him than any before at Fulham. Mitrovic’s focus will be on hitting 40, but many more will be look to next season already. It feels as if Silva and Fulham have a striker finally primed for the Premier League. ",positive,chelsea
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/man-city-real-madrid-champions-league-semi-final-b996522.html,Irresistible Man City miss golden chance to vanquish Real Madrid as another Champions League classic beckons,"pain’s champions-elect were made to look like chumps. The all-time kings of Europe reduced to the role of fools. Real Madrid endured a chastening night at the hands of Manchester City, when their very place in history was rocked to the core. Yet they head to the Bernabeu next week with everything to play for. This Champions League semi-final should have been over after half an hour, with Real humbled and humiliated by City’s sheer superiority. But Pep Guardiola’s side head to Spain with the slenderest 4-3 advantage after a night when it was impossible to shake the sense that an opportunity had been missed. It was notable that the Catalan needed to remind his players after this thrilling, breathless and reckless clash that they had won on the night. It felt like he was trying to convince himself. “Football is football, the result is the result, but how we performed is exceptional,” said Guardiola. “Nobody can say the performance was not good. I want to convince my players that we won the game and lift their heads up.” City were irresistible at times. They scored four and could have comfortably doubled that figure. Even after Karim Benzema’s Panenka penalty late completed the scoring, the home side had at least two more glorious chances to further extend their lead. It was that kind of night, with Real helpless to stop City when they were in full flow. But Carlo Ancelotti’s side do not know when they are beaten. That weight of history means there is never a lost cause – and with players like Benzema, Luka Modric and Vinicius Junior, they always have a chance. “If Real have three chances, they will score five goals,” said one Spanish journalist before kick-off. And while that was not the case, it was remarkable how they made the most of the moments when they came their way. Benzema’s ageless brilliance was on show again after disposing of Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea in the previous two rounds. At the Etihad, he had three shots and two goals, with the other effort blocked. City had done well early on to force him to do much of his work in deep areas to keep him away from the danger zone. In reality, his composure on the ball only helped to settle Real at the point when the City storm was at its most ferocious. Manchester City should have been out of sight against Real Madrid after just half an hour of the semi-final first-leg clash His first goal served notice to City of the danger of playing with too much abandon, halving the deficit after Kevin de Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus had fired the home side into a 2-0 lead inside 11 minutes. It instilled an uncertainty in Guardiola’s rearguard that remained throughout and is sure live on into next week’s second leg. Who would be brave enough to predict the outcome of that match, which cannot come soon enough? The expectation would be that both teams would try to tighten up defensively, but the question is whether either can? Real looked as vulnerable as they did in their quarter-final second leg against Chelsea, when they were blown away in front of their own fans by Thomas Tuchel’s side. Only the cushion of their 3-1 win at Stamford Bridge – and the brilliance of Modric and Benzema – saw them stumble over the line. Against City their tactic appeared to be no more than riding the storm and seizing their own moments. Guardiola – who was without a recognised right-back last night – will see his team significantly improved by the return of Joao Cancelo from suspension. But how Ruben Dias or Aymeric Laporte recover from such a wounding experience remains to be seen. But inspired by the ageless brilliance of Karim Benzema, the LaLiga champions-elect never know when they are beaten “If we play like we did in the second half, we won’t be able to win,” said Guardiola. “If we play like we did at other periods, we will. When I became a footballer and a manager, when you go to the Bernabeu there is no option but to win. You have to come through these situations to win the Champions League.” Ancelotti, meanwhile, warned City they might have missed a golden chance to secure their place in a second successive final. “It is a defeat that leaves us alive in the second leg,” he said. “We have to be better in our defensive aspect, but I believe we are able to create problems for them also. “In the second game I think if we defend better, we will win - but if we defend like today, we will be out of the competition.” Another classic lies in wait.

The 37-year-old scored his 17th Premier League goal of the season on Thursday to rescue a point against Chelsea and his overall tally stands at 23 in 37 club appearances. United’s problems are surely more systemic than merely Ronaldo, who remains an elite goalscorer, but his signing has been criticised in some quarters as an example of the club being focused on superstar names rather than coherent strategy. The arrival of Erik Ten Hag this summer further muddies the waters. With the Dutchman needing to rebuild, it’s unclear as to whether or not Ronaldo will feature, or even if the Portugal international would wish to given United will likely miss out on Champions League qualification. Under contract until the summer of 2023, Ronaldo has previously hinted he does not want to be challenging for merely a place in the top four. Speaking after United’s draw with Chelsea, Rangnick said: “His attitude, he’s 37 - it’s not normal.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/pep-guardiola-man-city-champions-league-biggest-threat-b996304.html,Pep Guardiola remains biggest threat to Man City’s Champions League hopes... he must keep emotions in check,"ith respect to Real Madrid’s golden oldies, Pep Guardiola remains the greatest threat to Manchester City reaching back-to-back Champions League finals. We are at that stage when the Catalan can over-think, at best, or go into complete meltdown, at worst. Either way, City’s failure to replicate their domestic dominance in Europe has generally been self-inflicted. That they go into tonight’s semi-final first leg as overwhelming favourites underlines the quality of Guardiola’s squad, considering they face a team on the verge of winning the Spanish title and are playing at this stage of the competition for the 31st time. Guardiola has, arguably, had the deepest pool of talent in Europe for the past five years, yet last season was his first final as City manager and defeat to Chelsea continued a pattern that has seen him lose to underdogs in each of his Champions League campaigns with the club. From Monaco to Tottenham to Lyon, City have contrived to find a way to blow it, just as the draw looked like opening up for them — and Guardiola’s fingerprints have been all over each of those disappointments. None more so than last May’s final, when he named a starting XI without a holding midfielder. When Thomas Tuchel got wind of the news while on the team bus, driving to the stadium in Porto, he quickly altered his own plans. Chelsea’s winning goal from Kai Havertz came as a result of Mason Mount exposing that glaring hole in the City team to play the German through. So, it has reached the point where City fans are left looking through their fingers as the Champions League reaches the crunch stages for fear of what Guardiola will do next. If they can be sure of anything, it is that Madrid will be ready to pounce on any chance given. They are in the last four because of Chelsea’s own meltdown in the first leg of their quarter-final at Stamford Bridge. Calamitous defending gifted them a 3-1 lead to defend at the Bernabeu. Even then, Carlo Ancelotti’s side were 15 minutes from being eliminated until a sublime moment from Luka Modric set up Rodrygo to send the tie into extra time. Pep Guardiola has been known to over-think his selection and tactical decisions in Manchester City’s quest for Champions League glory That game in Spain should be instructive to Guardiola: Madrid could not handle Chelsea’s speed and aggression. Only the cushion from the first leg allowed them to recover by picking their moments through the individual brilliance of Modric and Karim Benzema. They are capable of producing those moments against City, but are unlikely to be gifted the freedom they were in the first 50 minutes at Stamford Bridge. That is, unless Guardiola strikes again. City’s own performance in the Spanish capital against Atletico in the last round should serve as encouragement that they have matured on this stage. For all the recriminations directed at Diego Simeone and his streetwise team, City used all the gamesmanship they could muster to frustrate and run the clock down. It was a defensive masterclass, right out of the Simeone playbook. In previous years, Guardiola might have been tempted to play his way out of trouble. On this occasion, City snapped and snarled and stubbornly got over the finishing line. It felt like a significant moment for the club and their manager in terms of their European evolution.

In front of a sparse United crowd amid a fan protest against the Glazer ownership, Chelsea quickly settled into a good rhythm. Kai Havertz was guilty of squandering the visitors’ most significant openings in the first half, whipping a shot against the side netting after a breakaway before slapping a one-on-one shot against David De Gea’s shoulder. The goalkeeper was then able to deny a free header, straight at him, as Chelsea produced everything but a finish. Reece James and Mason Mount were enjoying the freedom of Manchester down the right and the midfielder attempted to prise open the deadlock with a whipped cross that beat De Gea, and Timo Werner, shortly after the break. Beforehand, Havertz had again wasted a good counter with a sloppy pass. SPONSORED It was no surprise when Marcos Alonso popped up, unmarked, to fire Chelsea ahead on the hour mark after another move down the right. But even the most optimistic of home fans would not have expected Cristiano Ronaldo to appear moments later and slam home a leveller, after good work from Nemanja Matic.

He’s fortunate coming in in the summer with five or six players on big contracts already leaving - that will help. “I think every United manager will get backing, he will get some money to spend but it’s about getting the right players and right characters into the club - what we’ve seen from this group of players that last few months has not been good enough.” ",positive,chelsea

Former teammate Berbatov wants to see Ronaldo continue into next season thanks to his consitent output in front of goal. “Ronaldo is doing incredibly well for his age with the way he plays and the goals he scores,” the Bulgarian told Betfair. “To have so many Premier League goals in a season at his age is an incredible achievement. He is doing what he needs to do, and that is score goals. “His game is different now than it was before, but one thing is a constant, the goals. He still produces and scores which is so important. “He has one more year at United, which is a good thing in my opinion, and now it is down to him whether he stays or leaves. I’d be glad to see him stay and of course things depend on the new manager and on what Ronaldo wants. He is an icon in football and when you are like that your opinion matters.” The Bees are enjoying a fine end to the season and have it in them to quieten Old Trafford and further Ralf Rangnick’s misery.

The Manchester United forward has scored 17 goals in 28 Premier League games this season, trailing only Mohamed Salah at the top of charts despite widespread criticism of his suitability to the modern game. Ronaldo scored his first League goal against Chelsea on Thursday to rescue a point at Old Trafford and recently hit the 100 mark during a loss to Arsenal at the Emirates.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-spurs-levy-summer-conte-transfers-b996593.html,Tottenham: Daniel Levy facing huge summer dilemma as Antonio Conte plots transfer overhaul,"aniel Levy is experienced enough to brush off speculation and is used to ignoring noise from his managers, but employing Antonio Conte must occasionally test the Tottenham chairman’s patience. This week, in the wake of Spurs’ frustrating stalemate with Brentford which dented their chances of returning to the Champions League, a fresh round of reports linked Conte with a summer exit, with the head coach rumoured to be interested in succeeding Mauricio Pochettino at Paris Saint-Germain. They raised the intriguing prospect of a sensational job swap between Conte and Pochettino, but Levy will surely be growing exasperated with Conte’s quit threats and rumours of his interest in other jobs — even if the Italian’s camp insist the PSG stories did not come from them. While Pochettino’s likely dismissal by PSG offers Levy an attractive safety net in the event that Conte walks at the end of the season, the danger for the chairman is a repeat of last summer, which he spent searching for a new manager and battling with Harry Kane over his future. These concerns are part of the package in employing Conte, who is notoriously high maintenance and described by one senior figure at Chelsea as making Jose Mourinho “look like a pussycat”. The hard-to-please coach will always demand more and his rhetoric should be viewed, at least in part, as a means of pressuring the club to give him what he wants. Clearly, there is an argument that Levy and managing director Fabio Paratici should do whatever possible to appease Conte in the transfer market this summer. Given Tottenham’s position in the food chain, the chairman may never again have one of the world’s top coaches, at the very peak of his powers, in his employ, and for all the (justified) talk of Pochettino being a better profile of manager for the club, backing Conte still feels like Spurs’ best chance of real success next season. For Levy, it is not quite so simple, though. Conte’s short-term contract, which runs until the end of next season, and his apparent concerns that Spurs do not have the means to compete for the League title, mean Levy and Paratici will have to be particularly careful to sign players who suit both Conte and the club this summer. As Saturday’s draw demonstrated, Conte is rigidly committed to his preferred system and, if he stays in north London, he wants at least six new players — among them two wing-backs and a left-sided centre-half who can play in a back three. He also favours experienced, senior players. Should Daniel Levy back Antonio Conte in the transfer market, knowing he could walk away from Tottenham? Conte tends to leave clubs in a better condition than he finds them but Levy will still be wary of backing the head coach to the tune of millions of pounds on specialist players when there remains a danger he could walk away as soon as he gets a more attractive offer, or at the end of his contract. Levy has already showed an admirable willingness to back Conte, offloading the club’s record signings, Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso, for nothing in January, and signing Dejan Kulusevski — a former Conte target at Inter Milan — and Rodrigo Bentancur from Juventus. Completely reshaping the squad in Conte’s image, however, poses long-term risks while his position and future remain uncertain, so Levy and Paratici must tread carefully. Liverpool’s rebuild under Jurgen Klopp, by contrast, was made easier by his long-term commitment to the club, ensuring they could sign players to suit the German’s approach. Manchester City have done the same with Pep Guardiola but Spurs are disadvantaged both by being more financially prudent than their rivals in the market, and having a rigid tactician whose future is not certain. Spurs have already spent £50million on a centre-half who excels in a back three and spending the same again on a left-footed version of Cristian Romero may not suit, say, Pochettino, who prefers playing a four-man defence (and might have also been happy to work with Lo Celso and Ndombele, as another example). It might be in Conte’s interests to start showing some commitment to Spurs, starting with a new deal The success of Kulusevski and Bentancur offer reasons for optimism, proving that Paratici can find targets to suit the club’s policy of young, versatile players while still satisfying Conte, but this summer will certainly test the relationship between the two Italians, and Levy’s willingness to cede control over big deals to the pair. Paradoxically, in pushing Spurs to back him with a drip-drip of hints and threats, Conte has arguably made it harder for the club to give him everything he wants. It might be in Conte’s interests to start showing some commitment to Spurs, starting with a new deal, if he is to convince the club to go full-throttle behind his vision. ",positive,chelsea

Son suffered a muscle injury in his leg during Wednesday's 2-0 defeat to Chelsea in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at Stamford Bridge. Spurs have five matches before the end of January, with League One Morecambe the visitors in the FA Cup third round on Sunday before the second leg against Chelsea on Wednesday night. They also play European rivals Arsenal, Leicester and Chelsea in the league before the end of the month. “The day after [the Chelsea game], he felt a bit of pain in his muscle, in his leg,” Conte said of Son. “He had a scan and now we have to make the right evaluation from the doctors. He has an injury. I don’t know, but probably he will stay without training sessions until the end of this cycle, for the international break.” In a separate interview with Spurs TV, Conte clarified that Son was expected to be sidelined for around two weeks. The Italian plans to rest Harry Kane against the Shrimps this weekend and rotate his side, but it is unclear who will deputise up front, with Steven Bergwijn, who Conte has previously touted for the role of Kane’s understudy, also injured. “Honestly, Harry played six games in 17 days,” Conte said. “And I think if I have the possibility, I think it’s right to give him a bit of a rest. “Also because after this game, before the international break, we have four games, very difficult games. Chelsea, Arsenal, Leicester and then Chelsea again. It’s always difficult to think, to decide not to start with Harry. But at the same time, in some games if we can take the risk it’s right to take. Heung-min Son was injured during Tottenham’s Carabao Cup defeat by Chelsea “I spoke with Steven today and his feeling is good. He’s improving day by day, step by step. My expectation and the medical department's expectation is to come back very soon. We need to help him. Also we had a problem with Son during the game against Chelsea. It will be very important to recover Steven Bergwijn.” Conte confirmed that Dele Alli would feature against Morecambe, while Bryan Gil, Giovani Lo Celso, Harry Winks, Tanguy Ndombele and Joe Rodon are also hoping for minutes.

Follow transfer deadline day LIVE with Standard Sport’s blog below! It’s been a long month and there’s been plenty to keep track of in the Premier League. Dele Alli to Everton, Christian Eriksen to Brentford and Philippe Coutinho were some of the most notable moves made. Here’s a full list of every incoming deal made by top-flight clubs in the January window. Just 16 months after signing a lucrative three-year contract and vowing to become an Arsenal legend, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left under a cloud, writes Simon Collings. Aubameyang was exiled by Mikel Arteta after being stripped of the captaincy following a disciplinary breach that ultimately led to a sad end to his time at Emirates Stadium. He has not played a minute since December, was dropped from the squad and Arteta said he failed to demonstrate the “commitment and passion” to play for the club. Clearly, their relationship was broken beyond repair. Read the full story here on the long-term thinking behind Arsenal’s bold decision. It’s the one we’ve been waiting for! Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s free transfer to Barcelona has officially been confirmed by Arsenal. Aubameyang was pictured arriving in Barcelona on Monday lunchtime, when the clubs were in talks over a potential loan move, but as reports emerged that the deal had broken down it was suggested he had only been in the Spanish city to visit family. However, the deal was revived late in the day as a permanent transfer, signalling the end of the forward’s Arsenal career. Read the full story here. Arsenal’s January transfer window was a tale of frustration and, ultimately, the failure to strengthen the squad will ramp up the pressure to spend in the summer, writes Standard Sport’s Simon Collings. Mikel Arteta was bullish throughout last month about the need for Arsenal to “maximise every window” and, while that may have been the case with outgoings, it wasn’t so with incomings.

Everton signed the midfielder on an initial free transfer, which could reach £30million, on transfer deadline day. It ended Dele’s long association with Spurs, and he thanked the club and fans for their support. Notably, former boss Pochettino and his staff were thanked for their “trust and guidance” during the early part of his career in North London. He wrote on social media: “It’s the end of the chapter but not the book. Thank you all for the messages.” Read the full story. Newcastle confirm the loan exit of Jack Young to Wycombe on loan.

Thomas Tuchel was left frustrated by the failure to cover Chelsea’s injury crisis during the January window, writes Standard Sport’s James Robson. But the German – who warned the season could be wrecked if no mid-season additions were made – will be boosted by the return of Reece James, Andreas Christensen and Trevoh Chalobah this month. Tuchel’s main priority was always to bring in longer-term targets if they became available in January. And the focus will be on stamping more of his mark on the squad in the summer, with a host names already identified. Read the full story. Barcelona president Joan Laporta has claimed that Ousmane Dembele has already found his next club after rejecting a move to the Premier League on deadline day. Chelsea were strongly linked with the French winger, who was available for a move after negotiations over a new Barcelona contract collapsed. Instead, he will now leave as a free agent in the summer. “The Dembele thing is difficult to understand,” Laporta told a press conference on Tuesday. “Dembele is in the team and Xavi has to build a competitive squad with players who have a future at this club. “We think that Dembele already has a contract with another club, they have insinuated that to us.

To expect anything in the way of wholesale changes during the arduous January market would be too much, although Conte is a man who does need satisfying. Having constantly spoken about needing to raise the level of the team, surely Spurs will be doing all they can to back him during what remains of this month. At least showing Conte there’s a chance to grow and a readiness to provide him with fresh options is of the utmost importance. If the the Italian does not feel there’s a willingness to rebuild the squad, perhaps the former Chelsea boss’ frustration will grow. With that in mind, here’s a look at the latest on Spurs’ transfer gossip. SPONSORED According to Fabrizio Romano, Spurs and Newcastle United have had loan offers for the forward snubbed. While Martial is believed to be looking for a way out of Old Trafford, it seems his future could lie abroad. Sevilla, Barcelona and Juventus are all said to be keen in what must be a blow for Spurs given Conte has called for a new addition in that department. Dan Kilpatrick has previously reported that Fabio Paratici is actively looking to sell the midfielder. Conte has been rather cutting in his assessment of the Frenchman and, after being booed off against Morecambe in the FA Cup, it’s very hard to see a way back for him. Still, finding a buyer this month is likely to be difficult. Perhaps the major name to have been linked with Spurs this month, Wolves have snubbed a £15m offer for the player and are holding out for £20m, It remains to be seen if Spurs will go that far. Given Pierluigi Gollini has barely covered himself in glory and Hugo Lloris is yet to extend his contract, a new goalkeeper could be needed at Spurs. Earlier this month, the MEN reported that Spurs were keen on a move for Manchester United’s Dean Henderson, although Ralf Rangnick has since stressed he’s looking to keep the England hopeful despite his lack of first-team minutes.

Kai Havertz’s early strike and a Ben Davies own goal set the Blues on course for a day out at Wembley - although they must first navigate a tricky trip to North London to face old boss Antonio Conte. While Chelsea cruised past Chesterfield in the third-round of the FA Cup on Saturday, Spurs were forced into a late comeback to defeat League One side Morecambe in their tie. That result crystalised the size of the task Conte faces at Tottenham, who squeezed past Watford and drew at Southampton before the two cup matches. Without a trophy since their 2008 League Cup triumph, the pressure is on Spurs to mount a famous comeback whereas Champions League holders Chelsea last won this competition seven years ago. Tottenham vs Chelsea is scheduled for a 7.45m GMT kick-off on Wednesday, January 12, 2022. Tottenham Stadium in London will host the match. TV channel: The match will be televised on Sky Sports Premier League and Football. Live stream: Sky Sports subscribers will be able to watch the match online via the Sky Go app. Live blog: You can follow up-to-the-minute updates from the match on Standard Sport’s LIVE blog. Conte made eight changes to his regular XI for the win over Morecambe, the nature of which suggests he will return to his starters on Wednesday night. Son Heung-min (leg) and Cristian Romero (hamstring) are out with Steven Bergwijn (foot) and Eric Dier (illness) doubts after missing the weekend’s game. Thomas Tuchel may be able to welcome N’Golo Kante and Thiago Silva back to the Chelsea team after their Covid-19 absence. Reece James and Trevoh Chalobah (both hamstring) are set to miss out along with Ben Chilwell (knee) and Edouard Mendy (AFCON). Cesar Azpilicueta (thigh) should be fit while the Blues could continue with youngsters Lewis Hall and Harvey Vale in their squad after runouts against Chesterfield. Chelsea’s ruthless edge shone through in last season’s Champions League run and it is clear to see that Tottenham are far from the finished product under Conte. With the aggregate score the only one that counts, the Blues should see this one through. If the tie is level at full-time, extra-time and penalties will be used with away goals not a factor in this competition. A 1-1 draw (3-1 to Chelsea on aggregate). Chelsea have not lost in 90 minutes in nine meetings with Tottenham. Tottenham wins: 55 Draws: 41 Chelsea wins: 75 ",positive,chelsea
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-steven-bergwijn-goal-antonio-conte-b977709.html,Steven Bergwijn’s Lucas Moura ‘Ajax moment’ could be a springboard for the Antonio Conte era at Tottenham,"eep into stoppage time at the King Power, Tottenham were on course for another one of those nights, the kind that has come to typify their season. They had struck the woodwork, had two efforts heroically cleared off the line, missed several more clear-cut chances, yet at the end of it all, were on course to be undone by two Leicester goals that owed much to defensive passivity and misfortune. Sergio Reguilon’s tackle had fallen kindly for Patson Daka to open the scoring, then Japhet Tanganga’s attempted block took James Maddison’s effort past Hugo Lloris after Harry Kane had equalised. An unbeaten start to life under Antonio Conte in the Premier League - the saving grace and great cause for optimism amid a meagre Carabao Cup semi-final defeat and a controversial European exit - was about to go up in smoke. And then came Steven Bergwijn, with a late cameo that evoked memories of Lucas Moura against Ajax, scoring goals in the 95th and 97th minutes to give Spurs a victory that will be celebrated perhaps as much as any in the turbulent years since. The Dutchman, on as a substitute after Maddison’s strike had put the Foxes back ahead, smashed home from close range after Matt Doherty’s effort was blocked, then paid homage to Lucas in the Johan Cruyff Arena with a reverse-finish that slid agonisingly past a stranded keeper so unfathomably late in the day you feared the referee’s whistle might blow before it had time to cross the line. The famous 3-2 in Amsterdam provided the greatest night of Mauricio Pochettino’s era and, at last, Antonio Conte will feel that, in a victory on the road by the same scoreline, his own has its springboard. For were it not for the late drama, this would have been a defeat difficult for the Italian to take not because of his team’s inadequacies, but because of how much they had impressed. Despite starting with a midfield trio that, on paper, possessed about as much flair as a box of Bran Flakes, Spurs produced their most incisive attacking display for some time and could conceivably have scored five by half-time. Much of that owed to an improved performance from Kane and the return of Sergio Reguilon. Having Reguilon back from injury mercifully allowed Conte to call time on his experiment with Doherty as a left-wing-back and his presence made all the difference to Spurs as an attacking force. The Spaniard linked nicely with Kane and Lucas and brought a directness in the final-third that has been lacking during Doherty’s brief stint as deputy, the Irishman forever slowing attacks out of the necessity of checking back onto his right-foot. Earmarked as one of the players who could most benefit from Conte’s arrival, Reguilon’s stock has risen further as understudies have faltered during his absence and if Spurs can bring similar thrust to the opposite flank it will ease the burden on a midfield not blessed with creativity. To his credit, Doherty was much-improved returning to his preferred position on the right as a half-time replacement for the ineffectual Emerson Royal, but a good 45 minutes will have done little convince Conte he is the solution, against a hefty backcatalogue of work that suggests he is not. As for Kane, the Carabao Cup matches against Chelsea had represented a backwards step, after he had looked close to rediscovering his best form when scoring in three successive Premier League games in December. The England captain was a lumbering, peripheral figure stranded on halfway for much of that two-legged tie as Thomas Tuchel’s side held Spurs at arm’s length for the best part of 180 minutes. Given his goalscoring record against Arsenal, he must have been as frustrated as anyone to see Sunday’s derby fall by the wayside, but Leicester have proved even more fruitful opposition over the years and the 28-year-old put those Chelsea regressions behind him with a threatening, domineering display, the spearhead of a Spurs attack that looked as potent as it has all season, particularly before the break. His composed equaliser on 39 minutes came after he had already headed against the bar and been denied by Luke Thomas on the line, and took his tally against the Foxes to 18 in 17 career league appearances. As the clock ticked beyond 90 minutes, though, it still looked like it would be his failure to make it 19 when slid clean-through by Lucas at 1-1 that would prove decisive. That was until deep into stoppage time, when he in turn sent Bergwijn clear to ensure it, in fact, did not matter one jot. ",positive,chelsea

Deadline Day is over with Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United making no significant additions to their squads. Tottenham had a busy day, with Juventus duo Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur becoming the first signings of the Antonio Conte era, while Tanguy Ndombele completed his return to Lyon on loan, Giovani Lo Celso went to Villarreal and Dele Alli joined Everton in a dramatic late deal. Arsenal have not added to their ranks, beyond Auston Trusty who will stay at Colorado Rapids, despite reports linking them to moves for Alvaro Morata and Alexander Isak, but did see a further departure. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang joined Barcelona on a free transfer, with an announcement expected on Tuesday morning. Ousmane Dembele was linked with both Chelsea and Manchester United in recent days, with reports suggesting a move to PSG has broken down, but will stay at Barcelona. Meanwhile, Kylian Mbappe is said to have decided to join Real Madrid.

There were no incomings as expected at Crystal Palace, though they have made Jean-Philippe Mateta’s move a permanent one. Donny van de Beek has joined Everton, while West Ham‘s hopes of re-signing Jesse Lingard are over, with Man United not willing to let him leave this month.

Follow transfer deadline day LIVE with Standard Sport’s blog below! It’s been a long month and there’s been plenty to keep track of in the Premier League. Dele Alli to Everton, Christian Eriksen to Brentford and Philippe Coutinho were some of the most notable moves made. Here’s a full list of every incoming deal made by top-flight clubs in the January window. Just 16 months after signing a lucrative three-year contract and vowing to become an Arsenal legend, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left under a cloud, writes Simon Collings. Aubameyang was exiled by Mikel Arteta after being stripped of the captaincy following a disciplinary breach that ultimately led to a sad end to his time at Emirates Stadium. He has not played a minute since December, was dropped from the squad and Arteta said he failed to demonstrate the “commitment and passion” to play for the club. Clearly, their relationship was broken beyond repair. Read the full story here on the long-term thinking behind Arsenal’s bold decision. It’s the one we’ve been waiting for! Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s free transfer to Barcelona has officially been confirmed by Arsenal. Aubameyang was pictured arriving in Barcelona on Monday lunchtime, when the clubs were in talks over a potential loan move, but as reports emerged that the deal had broken down it was suggested he had only been in the Spanish city to visit family. However, the deal was revived late in the day as a permanent transfer, signalling the end of the forward’s Arsenal career. Read the full story here. Arsenal’s January transfer window was a tale of frustration and, ultimately, the failure to strengthen the squad will ramp up the pressure to spend in the summer, writes Standard Sport’s Simon Collings. Mikel Arteta was bullish throughout last month about the need for Arsenal to “maximise every window” and, while that may have been the case with outgoings, it wasn’t so with incomings. Read the full story. Chelsea have confirmed the signing of Mason Burstow from Charlton, with the teenager heading back to the Valley on loan. Read the full story. Dele Alli paid special tribute to Mauricio Pochettino as he bid farewell to Tottenham after seven years at the club. Everton signed the midfielder on an initial free transfer, which could reach £30million, on transfer deadline day. It ended Dele’s long association with Spurs, and he thanked the club and fans for their support. Notably, former boss Pochettino and his staff were thanked for their “trust and guidance” during the early part of his career in North London. He wrote on social media: “It’s the end of the chapter but not the book. Thank you all for the messages.” Read the full story. Newcastle confirm the loan exit of Jack Young to Wycombe on loan.

Thomas Tuchel was left frustrated by the failure to cover Chelsea’s injury crisis during the January window, writes Standard Sport’s James Robson. But the German – who warned the season could be wrecked if no mid-season additions were made – will be boosted by the return of Reece James, Andreas Christensen and Trevoh Chalobah this month. Tuchel’s main priority was always to bring in longer-term targets if they became available in January. And the focus will be on stamping more of his mark on the squad in the summer, with a host names already identified. Read the full story. Barcelona president Joan Laporta has claimed that Ousmane Dembele has already found his next club after rejecting a move to the Premier League on deadline day. Chelsea were strongly linked with the French winger, who was available for a move after negotiations over a new Barcelona contract collapsed. Instead, he will now leave as a free agent in the summer. “The Dembele thing is difficult to understand,” Laporta told a press conference on Tuesday. “Dembele is in the team and Xavi has to build a competitive squad with players who have a future at this club. “We think that Dembele already has a contract with another club, they have insinuated that to us.

The deal would see Dele initially head to Goodison Park on a free transfer, with a £10m fee due to Tottenham after he makes 20 appearances. The fee could eventually rise to £30m depending on performance. The Toffees confirmed Frank Lampard as their new manager on Monday afternoon and within hours of his appointment the former Chelsea boss was hopeful of making Dele his first official signing. Everton have already wrapped up the loan signing of Donny van de Beek from Manchester United, with Lampard's approval. Spurs were expecting to loan out Dele this month but Everton used their final loan spot on Van de Beek and can only pursue a permanent deal. Dele joined Spurs from MK Dons in summer 2015 and established himself as one of the most exciting young players in Europe but he gradually fallen from favour in the last few years, and struggled under all three managers since Mauricio Pochettino was sacked. Newcastle were expected to come in for Dele this month but that never materialised.

Juventus have confirmed Tottenham have paid a £8.4m loan fee. Spurs will also have an obligation to buy Kulusevski if he hits certain goals over the next 18 months. Bentancur has 46 caps for Uruguay and will join up with the Spurs squad after their World Cup qualifier against Venezuela in Montevideo on Tuesday. Kulusevski has 20 caps for Sweden. It has been a busy deadline day for Spurs with Bryan Gil undergoing a medical ahead of his loan switch to Valencia. Tanguy Ndombele has completed a loan move to Lyon, while Dele Alli is discussing a permanent move to Everton and Villarreal are in talks with Giovani Lo Celso. Major targets had routinely rejected a move to North London before the Juve duo arrived; Adama Traore, Dusan Vlahovic, and Luis Diaz opting for moves elsewhere despite Tottenham interest. But Conte will hope that Kulusevski and Bentancur can inject fresh life into his squad, which are only fighting on two fronts after being kicked out of Europe and losing to Chelsea in the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup. The Italian manager competed against the pair as Inter Milan coach in recent seasons, and both are familiar to managing director Fabio Paratici, who brought them to Juventus during his 11 years in Turin.

According to The Times, the Gunners are hoping their improved chances of playing in next season’s Champions League could help them in luring the 24-year-old to the Premier League. Martinez has been hugely impressive for the Italian giants this term having scored 21 goals for Simone Inzaghi’s side, which has kept a number of European rivals on alert. This includes Manchester United who could reportedly offer Anthony Martial in exchange. And while Martinez is among the top targets for Mikel Arteta’s side, he’s not the only player whom the Spaniard is after. Gabriel Jesus of Manchester City and Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin are also said to be on the club’s radar as they prepare to revamp their forward line this summer. Arsenal’s hopes of signing Martinez could hinge on their ability to finish the season in the top four. The Gunners are sitting in fourth in the Premier League at present, two points clear of rivals Tottenham, however, with a north London derby just around the corner, talkSPORT host and former Tottenham midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes it’s Spurs who will pip Arsenal to the final Champions League spot.  He told thetalkSPORT Breakfast: “We’ve got to get through Liverpool which is a tough fixture and I’ll be surprised if we get anything from that, but both Arsenal and Tottenham are where they are because they have inconsistent performances. “If we’re talking about winning all of our games between now and the end of the season, we’d be like Chelsea and Liverpool. “We’ll slip up and Arsenal will slip up. We’ve got the north London derby which will be the biggest north London derby in recent times and that is a huge, huge fixture. “I just fancy us, under the lights with the players that we’ve got and the front three that we’ve got. If we step up I think we can turn them over, I really do. “This is a young Arsenal side and credit to them, no one expected them to be where they are and it was a big performance against West Ham and they’re a good young team. “But I think that Spurs have just got a little bit more experience than them and when the pressure’s on, we might just find a way to get it done.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

We are now into May, which means the business end of the year is fast approaching and the race for the Champions League spots is at fever pitch. With Manchester City and Liverpool well clear at the top, there are five more teams in contention for the final two Champions League places plus the Europa League spots, with some massive ties ahead. Most of the sides involved only have four games left, but Manchester United only have two. Here talkSPORT takes a look at the Premier League top-four battle as we approach the end of the campaign…   Chelsea have been in the top four the whole season, and are five points clear of fifth. However, their place in the top four isn’t secure yet and they are going to need a few more results from their last four league games. Thomas Tuchel’s side started the campaign as genuine title contenders, but four wins in 11 saw them drop well behind City and Liverpool. From there, it looked as if the Blues would comfortably seal third, but after defeats to Brentford, Arsenal and Everton, that doesn’t look to be guaranteed yet. Chelsea have had to deal with carnage away from the pitch this season, which would likely mean the Blues will have to cap their spending this summer. So, if they were to miss out on the Champions League, who knows what could happen to the club without that income? In their remaining games, Chelsea face Wolves and Leeds. If they manage to avoid defeat in these fixtures, they should do enough to secure their place in the top four. But a season that had so much promise looks like it will end in slight disappointment. Predicted finish – 3rd Wolves – H – May 8 Leeds – A – May 11 Leicester – H – May 19 Watford – H – May 22  Arsenal have turned it around after a nightmare start that saw them at the bottom of the table after three defeats. Since then, the Gunners have pushed on and they are right in the race for the top four. The North Londoners haven’t played in the Champions League since the 2016/17 campaign, and Mikel Arteta has put his faith in a lot of young and very talented footballers. This group of players have been brilliant for the Gunners, but they lost three games in a row recently against Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton. However, just when things could have turned sour, they managed to beat Chelsea, Man United and West Ham to move two points clear of Spurs. The Gunners still have some massive games to play against the likes of Tottenham and Everton, so Arsenal could yet miss out on a place in the top four. Predicted finish – 5th Leeds United – H – May 8 Tottenham – A – May 12 Newcastle – A – May 15 Everton – H – May 22  Tottenham have had a very odd season but they are still in the race for the Champions League. Spurs started the campaign with Nuno Espirito Santo in charge, but after winning his first three league games, things quickly went wrong and he was dismissed well before Christmas. Antonio Conte arrived as his replacement, and after a solid start in which Tottenham were unbeaten in the league for nine matches, they lost four of their next five, including a 1-0 defeat to Burnley. Things didn’t look great, but on transfer deadline day, Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur arrived from Juventus and have helped turn the season around. Spurs then scored 25 goals in seven league matches, winning six of those. However, they then lost to Brighton and only managed a 0-0 draw against Brentford, which halted their season. But they got back to winning ways on Sunday with a 3-1 victory over Leicester City, so they are back on track. If we look at their remaining fixtures, we can see they still have to play Liverpool and Arsenal. The North London derby against the Gunners could decide who lands that final Champions League spot, but Spurs should still have enough to finish fourth if they turn it on again. Predicted finish – 4th Liverpool – A – May 7 Arsenal – H – May 12 Burnley – H – May 15 Norwich – A – May 22  Man United have had a season to forget – they are out of all the cup competitions and look unlikely to get a place in the top four. The season started with so much optimism after the signings of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho. However, things quickly went wrong, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was dismissed early into the campaign. The Red Devils then brought Ralf Rangnick in until the end of the year as interim manager, but he has never performed that role before and has struggled to get a tune out of this squad. The German has only lost five of his 22 league games in charge but seven draws in that time have cost the Red Devils valuable points, and it looks increasingly likely they won’t finish in the top four. Man United still have to play Crystal Palace and a resurgent Brighton in their last two, but Arsenal and Tottenham have two games in hand on the Red Devils. Therefore, this campaign has the potential to end terribly for the world’s most famous club. Predicted finish – 7th Brighton – A – May 7 Crystal Palace – A – May 22  West Ham have not been outside of the top ten this season and have been as high as third on some occasions. It’s been highly impressive given that David Moyes has a small squad to work with and has one first-team striker in Michail Antonio. The Hammers are also deep into the Europa League, so the fact they have kept up with the likes of Arsenal and Tottenham is commendable, and they should finish in a Europa League spot no matter what. This season has seen the Irons beat the likes of Liverpool and Chelsea but the top four might just be out of their reach. However, given they are in the semi-finals of the Europa League, you would have to make them one of the favourites for that competition, so they could end up in the Champions League anyway. West Ham still have to play Manchester City, so they could still have a big impact on the title race.

https://talksport.com/football/1075375/premier-league-relegation-run-in-fixtures-permutations-predicted-finishes-leeds-everton-watford-burnley-norwich/,"Premier League relegation run-in: Remaining fixtures, key clashes, permutations and predicted finishes for bottom five as Everton battle Leeds and co to survive, Norwich already relegated","We are into May, which means we are nearing the end of the 2021/22 Premier League campaign and the relegation battle looks like it will go down to the wire. At the end of the year, three teams will be relegated from the top flight and into the Championship. Norwich City’s demotion has already been confirmed, but who will join them? Assuming Southampton and Brentford are now safe, the fight to survive is down to four teams. Most sides have four games remaining this season but Everton have five, which could cause heartbreak for some. Here, talkSPORT looks at how the Premier League relegation picture is shaping up as we enter the final weeks of the campaign.   Burnley have been in the Premier League for six seasons and they now look capable of securing a seventh. The Clarets have won three league games in a row to move out of the drop zone and above Leeds United. They have still only scored 31 goals but they have found a way to win games at this crucial stage of the season. It now looks possible they will stay up after Michael Jackson replaced Sean Dyche and the Clarets are unbeaten in his four matches so far. They have what looks to be a favourable fixture list, with Tottenham the only fixture you would think they would struggle to take anything from. The ties against Aston Villa and Newcastle at Turf Moor look huge, and if they can win both of them, Burnley should remain in the Premier League. Predicted finish – 17th Aston Villa – H – 7 May Tottenham – A – 15 May Aston Villa – A – 19 May Newcastle – H – 22 May  Leeds have conceded the most goals in the Premier League (72), one more than Norwich, and because of that, relegation is still a threat. This year has been a struggle for Leeds and they have been in a dog-fight all season. Injuries to key players have exposed their squad and, after heavy defeats to the likes of Liverpool, Everton and Tottenham, Marcelo Bielsa was sacked and replaced by Jesse Marsch. The American made a poor start but the Whites were unbeaten in five. However, they were thrashed by Manchester City at the weekend and are only two points clear of the drop zone. Leeds still have to play Chelsea and Arsenal, while they travel to Brentford on the last day of the season. The Whites also take on Brighton, with the Seagulls in decent form at the moment. Leeds’ recent wins over Norwich, Wolves and Watford looked to have been enough to keep them up. But Burnley’s resurgence means they will probably need at least one more victory from their final four to seal their place in the Premier League next season. Predicted Finish – 16th Arsenal – A – 7 May Chelsea – H – 17 April Brighton – H – 15 May Brentford – A – 22 May  Everton have never been relegated from the Premier League but there is a real danger of that happening this year. Poor decisions have hit the Toffees hard and they are now relying on Frank Lampard to save them. Everton replaced Carlo Ancelotti with former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez, and despite a good start, it was never going to end well, and the Spaniard was dismissed in January. Lampard has arrived in his place and the Toffees are unbeaten in four at Goodison Park, but defeats away from home to Burnley, West Ham and Liverpool have plunged them into deep trouble. At the moment, it is hard to see Everton picking up another point on the road, given they have lost their last seven away fixtures. So, the home games against Brentford and Crystal Palace are huge. Predicted finish – 18th Leicester – A – 7 May Watford – A – 11 May Brentford – H – 15 May Crystal Palace – H – 19 May Arsenal – A – 22 May  Watford are onto their third manager of the season and they hope Roy Hodgson can keep them in the Premier League. The Hornets started well with Emmanuel Dennis impressing, but things turned sour, and Xisco Munoz was sacked and replaced by Claudio Ranieri. The Italian managed just one league win against Man United and was dismissed after a 3-0 defeat to Norwich. Hodgson has tried to sort out the defence and Watford have managed two wins since he arrived, but they have lost five games in a row and are 12 points from safety. The Hornets still have four matches to play and face Chelsea. But the big clash is against Everton. However, they lost to Leeds, Brentford and Burnley, which means an escape is looking very unlikely. Hodgson knows how to keep teams up, but he might have arrived too late to save Watford… Predicted finish – 19th Crystal Palace – A – 7 May Everton – H – 11 May Leicester – H – 15 May Chelsea – A – 22 May  Norwich have been in the relegation zone the whole season, and on Saturday after defeat to Aston Viilla, they were officially relegated. The Canaries have managed five wins but have lost 23 of their 34 games and have conceded 71 goals. Smith tried his best, but an escape never looked likely and they have to reflect on a very disappointing campaign. Norwich were active in the summer transfer market and brought in 11 players, but it wasn’t enough. Smith’s side still have West Ham and Tottenham to face, so there could be a bit more pain for supporters to endure before they can forget about this campaign altogether.

https://talksport.com/football/1100030/erik-ten-hag-cristiano-ronaldo-man-utd-transfer-news/,"Erik ten Hag told to ‘find a way’ to get ‘phenomenal’ Cristiano Ronaldo in Manchester United team, and Ralf Rangnick wants quality strikers","talkSPORT host Jason Cundy believes incoming Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag must prioritise getting Cristiano Ronaldo into his team. The Ajax manager will take the reins at Old Trafford in the summer, and after underwhelming Premier League season, with the new man expected to oversee a squad overhaul. Ten Hag’s favoured style of play centres around dominating possession and pressing from the front which doesn’t necessarily suit 37-year-old Ronaldo, who’s Man United’s top scorer this season. But despite this, Cundy believes that whilst United do need to bolster their attacking options, Ten Hag must still build his team around Ronaldo given his impressive displays, which has seen him notch up 24 goals so far this season. “If Ten Hag is going to play the way he has done at Ajax, you would’ve thought that Ronaldo cannot play every single game,” the former Chelsea player said on The Sports Bar following Man United’s 3-0 win over Brentford. “But then you find a way. His goals have been phenomenal again. His goals to game ratio is phenomenal, greatest goal scorer ever. “So you find a way to have Ronaldo in and around the squad. Whether he’s going to start 38 Premier League games I very much doubt, I can’t see that happening. “United do need help up top, they do.”  United legend Gary Neville echoed Cundy’s thoughts, saying on commentary for Sky Sports: “This is the best they have played this season. “They have looked more connected as a team. “My man of the match is Cristiano Ronaldo. The penalty, the build-up to it, and he had one disallowed in the first half. “Just his all-round performance has been outstanding.” The Portuguese’s future at the club has been questioned over the last few months after his side have suffered yet another disappointing season, with hopes of silverware fading after their defeat to Atletico Madrid in the last-16 of the Champions League in March. However, despite this, Red Devils hero Roy Keane doesn’t believe his former teammate Ronaldo is heading for the exit, agreeing that Ten Hag needs to keep him at Old Trafford.  “I don’t think his body language was suggesting that he was leaving,” Keane explained. “I just look at the goals he’s got, his performances warrant him staying at the club.” Keane continued: “But Man United need to get other strikers in there, there has to be competition for places. If your leading goal scorer, who you’re depending on is 37 years of age, then that’s certainly not good. “But I’d certainly be hanging on to Ronaldo. You might have to have a conversation about the way you’re going to play, or that he won’t be playing week, in week out. But why would you get rid of a player that scores that many goals?” And the need for additional firepower is something current boss Ralf Rangnick is well aware of.  “For me, it is obvious Manchester United needs two more quality strikers that just give this team more options, more quality and more weapons,” he said. Asked what he meant, he explained: “Strikers. Modern strikers do not necessarily have to be wingers. If you look to Liverpool or Manchester City and look at their strikers, they have five or six top-class strikers. “Gabriel Jesus, until four or five weeks ago, he hardly played. Now he is playing again regularly and if you look at the number of players they have and ask me if Gabriel Jesus is a central striker or a winger, is Grealish a central striker or a winger, they are all strikers who can play in different positions, they can also switch and they can rotate. “That kind of players, we don’t have that many. Mason Greenwood would have been one of those players who regularly played but then after the West Ham game he was no longer part of the squad. “Martial was on loan at Sevilla, Edinson Cavani was injured most of the time so we didn’t have that many alternatives up front.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

https://talksport.com/football/1099806/declan-rice-west-ham-transfer-teammates-man-utd-chelsea-links/,West Ham teammates ‘wind up’ Declan Rice about Chelsea and Manchester United links as England star admits he gets ‘battered’ on social media about £150m price tag,"Declan Rice revealed his West Ham teammates ‘wind him up’ about speculation linking him with a move away from the club. The 23-year-old has been incredible for the Hammers in midfield as they continue to perform well in the Premier League, while also reaching the semi-finals of the Europa League. This, coupled with his standout displays when playing for England, have made him one of the most highly-rated young talents in the game. Chelsea and Manchester United have both been linked with moves for the player who West Ham would want around £150million for. It has been reported that Rice has turned down three contract offers from the club with his future looking set to be away for east London. “I feel like playing well comes with speculation,” Rice told Sky Sports. “I’ve had two or three top seasons with West Ham and the top clubs around the country are always going to be watching. It’s not just me, it’s the same for every player. “I think it’s important not to get too carried away with that. We’ve had a good season with West Ham and there have been big games I’ve had to play in so I feel like my focus has always been on that. If I thought about other things, I’d get carried away and that wouldn’t be fair on the team or the manager. “I can’t help speculation, even with the numbers that get talked about. I get battered for it all the time on social media, but I can’t help that. I can help by going on the pitch and performing as best as I can. “They [West Ham teammates] wind me up all the time. It’s crazy to speak about to be honest, so I just kind of block it out and do what I do best and that’s play football.”   “They [West Ham teammates] wind me up all the time. It’s crazy to speak about to be honest, so I just kind of block it out and do what I do best and that’s play football.” Rice came third in the prestigious Football Writers’ Association Men’s Player of the Year award, behind only Mohamed Salah and Kevin De Bruyne, when the results were announced on Friday. It gives an indication of just how good Rice has been this term and the midfielder thinks he can only get better. “It’s not bad,” Rice said on finishing third in the FWA awards. “I would like to have won it, but obviously up against Salah and De Bruyne it’s hard to say, because I can never imagine putting my name with those types of players. “To come third, it shows that people have appreciated what I’ve done on the football pitch. This season, I feel like I’ve taken another step in the right direction in my career, but I’m still only 23 and trust me, I know myself and I’ve got so much more that I can let out of the bag. “I know that, my coaches tell me that and I think it just comes with time and as I get older, it’ll keep coming and coming. I feel like you’re only seeing the start of me. I’m going to keep pushing and getting better.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

https://talksport.com/football/1099744/man-utd-fan-protest-glazer-family-brentford-simon-jordan/,Manchester United fans plotting protest against Glazers accused of ‘getting ahead of themselves’ as Simon Jordan says they wouldn’t be as angry if team was winning,"Simon Jordan believes that Manchester United fans are overestimating their influence ahead of yet another protest against the Glazer ownership. It’s understood fans are preparing a march before the Monday night clash with Brentford. It’s understood supporters are being urged to walk out of Old Trafford on 73 minutes, 17 minutes from the end, to signify the 17 years in which the club has been under the current ownership. While admitting that United fans are more than entitled to make their feelings known in a peaceful manner, Jordan believes that there’s only so much that supporters can do when dealing with vast sums of money within the game. He told White and Jordan: “I do think that some fans are getting ahead of themselves and getting carried away with what they’re entitled to do, how to represent their discontent, how influential they are in the world of football and how the European Super League was stopped by fans. “There’s a balance between expressing dissatisfaction, and then engineering disruption and your reach exceeding your grasp. “Man United fans are fully entitled to express their feelings. It’s not my right to tell them how to feel about their ownership model, they’ve every right to be as unhappy as they want to be, but if you’re going to realistically oust the Glazers, you need a proper solution. “But if you’re just going to bark at the moon because you don’t like something… everyone knows they’re unhappy about it. “Do you think this dissatisfaction would be anywhere near as acute if they were winning on the pitch?”   “I acknowledge their point, but if the club were doing well on the pitch, it would be nowhere near the level it is now.” Jordan added: “The Glazers need that team to win too. They’re not stupid. They know that when they’re not in the Champions League their share price is deflated. “Of course their hearts are not with United, they’re American. Do you think Roman Abramovich cared that much about Chelsea? He cared because it was a reflection of him and he wanted to win and he wanted to buy Chelsea to legitimise his position in the world. “What you’re looking for is the perfect circle where someone buys your football club, gives you exactly what you want and when you want it. Even then there will be a segment of Man United fans who won’t be happy if the team doesn’t win.”  But stepping outside of the situation at Old Trafford, Jordan believes that fans must start understanding that football is ‘a money business’. He said: “Man City wasn’t bought because Sheikh Mansour cared about Manchester, he wanted to legitimise a particular regime. “Newcastle hasn’t been bought because the Saudis are wonderful people, they’re being bought for the exact same purpose. “This notion that football clubs aren’t commercial animals, people have to grow up and accept that. “We’ve got to live in the real world where footballers are getting £200k a week, big businesses are broadcasting it around the world, it is now a money business.”  Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

https://talksport.com/football/1099694/man-utd-transfer-ward-prowse-beckham-free-kick-record-world-cup-2022/,"‘Phenomenal’ James Ward-Prowse is a Manchester United transfer target, has David Beckham free-kick record in his sights, and wants World Cup 2022 role","Manchester United transfer target James Ward-Prowse has been tipped to leave Southampton this summer by former teammate Charlie Austin. The England international is enjoying his most prolific season of his career, netting 10 goals in all competitions, and a £75million deal has now been mooted ahead of the Old Trafford overhaul. His set-piece taking has always been lavished with praise and this season a raft of fantastic free-kicks see him now hot on the heels of David Beckham’s Premier League record. The England icon netted 18 in the English top flight and Ward-Prowse now has 14 to his name. But as a potential battle with Man City for his signature beckons, the clubs challenging for the midfielder have been told that the ‘underrated’ schemer would not only be valuable because of his deadball abilities. Austin, who played with Ward-Prowse 46 times over a four-season spell, reckon his all-round game make him a ‘phenomenal’ acquistion, despite the midfielder taking his time to reach his peak. Asked why he had taken so long to reach this level, he told Drive Time last week: “I don’t know. When I was there with him he played second fiddle to [Victor] Wanyama, to Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Jordy Clasie, Oriol Romeu and Steven Davis. “Maybe he just took his time and then over the last two years he’s cemented himself as club captain but certainly know I think it’s time to leave.”  So why would Ward-Prowse want to leave having reached new heights at St Mary’s? Austin thinks he may well have ambitions for later in the year. He said: “I think, if he wants to go to the World Cup, he needs to be at a different football club [compared] to what Southampton are offering and how they are performing. “I think he’s more appealing if he’s at a different club.” Pressed again on why he didn’t move earlier in his career, Austin added: “He’s come throught the academy there and has been there for so many years. I just think that it hasn’t been the right opportunity. “I think now is the time for him to move. “His set-pieces and that are brilliant. He’s probably going to beat David Beckham’s record but, the nuts and bolts of his game, running hard, winning the ball back, and leading his team are phenomenal.”  And former Newcastle and Crystal Palace star Darren Ambrose also believes that Ward-Prowse is capable of playing for a side outside of the top three – which is definitely the case right now for United. He toldtalkSPORT:“I’ve been a massive advocate of James Ward-Prowse, and I think he gets into any team. “If you look at the Premier League table with Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea as the top three, anybody below that he would get in the team as a starter and not make them worse, absolutely.  “The argument of what happens if you take the free-kicks out of it, you can’t because that’s a massive part of the game. “Not many clubs have a set-piece taker like him so you can’t argue about what happens if you take that element out of his game.” He added: “When you’ve got a player like James Ward-Prowse, there’s no one better as a deliverer of balls into the box and when you get a free-kick around the box, you think it’s a goal. I think he’s massively underrated.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY. FIRST SINGLE & E/W BET ONLY. ODDS OF 1/1 OR GREATER. 3 x £10 BET TOKENS.

https://talksport.com/football/1099718/chelsea-sir-jim-ratcliffe-bid-man-utd-fan-simon-jordan/,Simon Jordan calls Sir Jim Ratcliffe a ‘disruptor’ for Chelsea bid and warns Manchester United fan ‘not always successful’ in sport,"Simon Jordan labelled Sir Jim Ratcliffe a ‘disruptor’ for his 11th hour bid for Chelsea. Todd Boehly’s consortium is understood to remain on course to be confirmed as the preferred bidder and then handed the opportunity to seal a Stamford Bridge takeover from Roman Abramovich. The Russian oligarch put the club up for sale in March amid Russia’s war in Ukraine, but was later sanctioned by the UK government and had his assets frozen. Chelsea were still able to operate on a special licence with New York-based merchant bank The Raine Group handling the process overseeing the sale. The Treasury will have to ratify the club’s sale for the eventual takeover, but significant progress has been made with LA Dodgers co-owner Boehly expected to be named the preferred bidder. That was until Britain’s richest man, Ineos owner Ratcliffe, confirmed a last-ditch £4.25billion bid for the club. Manchester United fan Ratcliffe carried out extensive due diligence on Chelsea in 2019, only to opt against submitting a formal offer to buy the west London club. The British billionaire had distanced himself from a bid for Chelsea in early March, with his brother Bob reiterating previous determination at Ineos not to be ‘dumb money’ in football.  But crucially, Ratcliffe never categorically ruled himself out of a bid for the Blues. Former Crystal Palace owner Jordan does not believe that Ratcliffe’s bid will succeed and the £4.25billion figure quoted is not quite all it seems. When asked why Ratcliffe has made the late bid, Jordan told talkSPORT: “No idea… being a disruptor? His bid is the lowest bid. He hasn’t bid what the other guys have bid. “The other guys have bid near to £3billion and he has bid the £2.5billion, which was supposedly the price people were to get to and bid a future commitment of £1.75billion. A future commitment, which I’m suspecting the other guys will spend just as much as he’s forced to spend. “If they are going to develop the stadium, which I suspect they are all going to, they are all going to the same place. “He’s had ample time to get in a situation where he could have done this. Whatever has prompted him behind this?  “You also have the Todd Boehly bid, the make up of that and who is behind it. There are some very interesting people, not necessarily financially well heeled, but people who are intellectually well heeled like Danny Finkelstein. “It’s going to be Todd Boehly and his gang, those are going to be the guys who come out of it. “Jim Ratcliffe, whenever he gets involved in sport it is not always the greatest success. He wasn’t the greatest success with Ben Ainslie over the Americas Cup, but the man has significant wealth.  “He’s a Manchester United fan, not that that influences who you can and can’t own. “If he wanted to be involved in this process, he could have been at some point and probably didn’t want to be at the table in a bidding auction with other people, but this bid that has been dressed up as £4.25billion… what you spend in the future has nothing with what you buy the football club for. “There are two things. The price you’ve got to pay to own this business and what you project to spend in the future, that’s for the birds.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.
