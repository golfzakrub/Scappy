https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gareth-southgate-given-23-reasons-23843872,Gareth Southgate given 23 reasons why Steven Gerrard was right about Aston Villa man,"Ollie Watkins is aiming to hit double figures for consecutive Premier League seasons with five games remaining this campaign. The England international scored his ninth goal of the season in Villa's 2-0 win over Norwich City at the weekend. The result relegated the Canaries and the striker's former head coach Dean Smith, but the 51-year-old will be proud of Watkins as he continues to make an impact at the highest level. Smith recruited Watkins for Brentford and later Villa, as he broke the club's transfer record to bring the versatile forward to Villa Park for £30million two summers ago. And since Watkins made his Premier League debut, only three strikers have scored more Premier League goals than him.

The 24-year-old scored 14 goals in the Premier League last season and earned himself a call-up to the England national team in March 2021. After scoring against San Marino on his Three Lions debut, he was handed four more caps, but wasn't picked for England November internationals. Speaking in December, Steven Gerrard claimed that the Villa forward could force his way back into Gareth Southgate's plans before the 2022 World Cup. ""It’s been a pleasure to work with him and I’m looking forward to the future. I’m delighted to have him here,"" Gerrard said. ""Ollie has just got to be the best he can be for Aston Villa and I’m sure that will be enough for him to get back in the England squad and I’m sure Gareth Southgate will be watching him closely. But the best thing you can do to get into England squads is to be consistent and do your stuff for your club, and Ollie is certainly doing that."" Villa head coach Gerrard was also certain that Watkins would thrive in his system. He said: ""I don’t think there is a limit for Ollie. ""He’s got the lot – pace, power, aggression. He will grow, he will enjoy the style we play so there isn’t a ceiling for him."" And Gerrard was proven right as Southgate turned to Watkins in the March internationals when Tammy Abraham was ruled out of the squad due to injury. Watkins played one minute of the game against Switzerland, before he was handed a start against Ivory Coast in the second fixture of the break. He scored his second goal for the Three Lions against Ivory Coast and has since played with a spring in his step for Villa. Despite Gerrard's side being on a tough run of form, Watkins has impressed in the past month or so, netting two goals in four games. He is now aiming to get at least his 10th goal of the season with a double header Burnley, two games against title rivals Liverpool and Manchester City and a game against Crystal Palace all to come this month.

The 20-year-old is the latest youngster to break into Villa's first-team ranks and cement his place in the starting XI. Ramsey has enjoyed an exceptional Premier League campaign following on from his breakthrough season last term. He has made 31 league appearances for Villa this season and has started all but one of Steven Gerrard's first 22 games in charge of the club. The England Under-21 has scored six goals and is also the club's joint-second top goal scorer this campaign.

As a product of the Villa academy, the midfielder has been with the club since the age of six and progressed through the ranks. And when asked how much of a lift it gives him when supporters are chanting his name, Ramsey replied: ""Obviously being a local lad, I’ve been going to Villa Park since I was the age of eight now. ""I know what it’s like to sing those songs, when I was singing about Jack (Grealish), so now for the fans to sing it about me, it gives me a real buzz to go out and play. I think especially in front of my friends and family to hear the fans singing my name, it’s a good feeling."" Speaking of Ramsey, Villa boss Gerrard told BirminghamLive: ""I've been very aware of the Ramseys because of how well this club did in the Youth Cup. They obviously played Liverpool in the final and I was aware of the commentators speaking of the Ramsey brothers, also the Carneys (Chukwuemeka) and Tims (Iroegbunam), those around the game. ""It probably wasn't until Arsenal away where he curled one into the top corner. I really liked the technique of that goal. I think that was the moment where I thought, 'Ooh!' ""To score a goal like that, in an environment like that at Arsenal at that age, that is normally a moment, being a lover of the game, where it makes you think, 'Hang on a minute, this kid might be a player!' ""Then, obviously Dean (Smith) played him some more before I arrived but it's not until you get up close and personal with someone on the training pitch and you see his level and potential, you see the human being... That's when you get really excited about the talent. ""I've said it quite a bit. I don't want to keep talking JJ up. I want him to play his football and to protect him and manage him in the best possible way but, without a doubt, he's someone I want to build around this club moving forward."" ",positive,norwich

After Norwich City lost 2-0 to Aston Villa and Burnley beat fellow strugglers Watford, the Premier League's bottom side were relegated with four games left of the season. Ollie Watkins scored the opener in the first half, before Danny Ings netted his sixth goal for the campaign in second half additional time. The result means former Villa boss Smith will now turn his attentions to getting the Canaries back up and out of the Championship next season. But he was frustrated with his side's mistakes against Villa at the weekend after claiming there was a sense of inevitability about the club's relegation in the end.

So we felt that we could play in them areas and drag midfielders across the pitch and switch play quickly and play inside them. ""I thought we done it really well in the first half, Pierre [Lees-Melou] had a really good chance when he really should have done better. I thought we controlled the football for long periods of the game as well. As I say, a slip has cost us."" For Villa, the result pushed them up to 13th position and, with five games left to play this campaign, Steven Gerrard's side are looking up and will be hoping to end with a flourish after enduring a turbulent season to say the least.

https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/five-aston-villa-squad-issues-23838431,The five Aston Villa squad issues Steven Gerrard must sort,"Aston Villa are set for another busy transfer window this summer with plenty of outgoings and several incomings expected. Steven Gerrard will be backed in the market with owners Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens hoping the club can challenge for European football next season. Following a positive January window where the club signed Philippe Coutinho (loan), Lucas Digne and Calum Chambers, the Villa boss wants to add more quality to improve his starting XI. A holding midfielder and more defensive reinforcements are at the top of Gerrard's wish list, while Villa will also target more attacking talent, according to reports. Here are five issues that the Villa head coach must sort this summer. READ MORE: Fresh Carney Chukwuemeka transfer claims emerge amid Aston Villa uncertainty READ MORE: Philippe Coutinho has made feelings clear on Aston Villa transfer WHO WEARS THE ARMBAND? One burning question which fans might not know the answer to until the start of next season, is who will wear the captains armband when the new campaign kicks off in three months time? Gerrard isn't convinced that current skipper Tyrone Mings will keep the captaincy past the end of this season. ""I think it's really important, especially with this group of players,"" Gerrard said of the role of captaincy. ""We took over this group who were two points above a relegation fight. I think what we're looking for in terms of help and support for the group is that we need more leaders. ""We need more people who have perhaps been there and done it, and have that type of experience to come in and support a lot of the young talent we've got within the group. So, for me, I think certain teams, i.e. let's use Man City or Real Madrid who are serial winners... maybe the captaincy is not as important because they've got a manager and a level of players across the board who are world-class or in the main - and maybe the captaincy isn't as vital. ""When you take over a team in 16th and just two places above relegation and you're having passages of periods where you're looking strong and good and you're a little bit inconsistent, it's important that leadership is added to the group. It's important that leadership is retained in the group so, when I decide who's captain at the end of the season, they'll have a very important part to play and a very important role to play because we need to turn this team into a more consistent team."" Gerrard added: ""Ty was really appreciative of the opportunity to continue with the armband when I first arrived. I made it abundantly clear to him first before we put it public that that was what we were going to do. ""We needed time, with my staff, to find out who can lead. Tyrone's in with a good shout [of retaining captaincy next season] without a doubt. We've been happy with what he's given so far. But now's not the right time - with eight games to go - to pick the long-term captain of Aston Villa. ""I'll make a decision on the captaincy at the end of the season, beginning of next season, which is what I said when I was first asked about it [at the unveiling press conference in November]. I think it's always important to get in amongst the group to see what they're like every minute of every day. See who's the glue of the team; see who leads in the right way; see who leads through adversity - not just when the sun's shining. To see who's prepared to go above and beyond; see who sets the right standards on a daily basis. ""We're still working that out and I still won't rule out the option of someone coming in who I know, who's also capable of being in the running for it so it's something I'm really analysing closely now. I'll make a decision some time during pre-season before the [new] season starts."" FIRST XI CHANGES Gerrard is keen to not only bolster his squad in the summer window, but also improve on his current XI. Speaking ahead of the 2-0 win over Norwich, the Villa boss made that point clear. Gerrard said: ""What we’ve done is analyse this squad all the way through and given opportunities to everyone. We would have liked to have given more opportunities to players who have been injured, like Bertrand Traore and Leon Bailey. ""It’s also important that certain individuals are seen. There is a thinking behind a lot of opportunities but I am looking for a more settled team moving forward. ""We will be recruiting for the XI. But it’s important to play the big picture because there is no doubt there will be some people moving on and there will be incomings as well, and it’s important that both are seen. There is a thinking behind it. It’s not me wanting to chop and change and do certain things."" READ MORE: Aston Villa shortlist to fulfill Steven Gerrard's biggest transfer priority READ MORE: Five Aston Villa prospects who could leave the club on loan next season CONTRACT DILEMMAS Carney Chukwuemeka is no closer to signing a new contract with Villa, while Douglas Luiz is also yet to pen fresh terms and could leave the club this summer. Both midfielders has been given opportunities to impress Gerrard since he took over in November, though that department of his squad could look a lot different come the start of the new season. Meanwhile, veteran Ashley Young is in talks over signing a new contract and is open to extending his stay at Villa Park. The 36-year-old returned to Villa last summer and signed a one-year contract with the option of a further 12 months. Other players with contracts that are slowly running down are Anwar El Ghazi and Frederic Guilbert. Both players are currently out on loan and are expected to find permanent exits from the club when the window opens in June. COUTINHO AND/OR BUENDIA One criticism that has been fired Gerrard's way in recent weeks is down to his reluctance to give Emi Buendia enough game time to make an impact in games. The Argentine has started just one of Villa's last nine matches, but has still managed to produce two assists in that time. Gerrard told BirminghamLive about the playmaker: ""We’ve got a real strong relationship with Emi, we’re happy that he is here. He’s fighting on a daily basis for more game time, obviously them opportunities have come from the bench of late, but he has started a lot of games initially when I first came in. ""So the challenge is very much there for him when he gets the opportunity, whether that’s from the start or from the side, we’re looking for that creative contribution from him, goals or assists. That’s the best way for him to start winning a starting shirt consistently and deliver and execute and get numbers in the game."" Gerrard added: ""He works extremely hard every day, he’s tenacious and warrior-like in how he goes about it. A lot of our forward players have got to continue trying to keep the crowd in the right place, they have to deliver and execute in the final third, that’s what they get paid to do. But that’s not just at Emi, it’s all of our goal scorers, our wingers, our tens, our attacking players. ""We’ve got a lot of talent in the building but the reality is we’re not scoring enough goals of late, that’s what we’re expecting. We’re expecting them to push and score or create in big moments to put us in a better place in the league."" Asked whether Buendia can play in the same team as fellow playmaker Coutinho, Gerrard replied: ""At certain times, against certain opponents, I have seen it work before. But not in every game, I think they are quite similar, but what you have got is two creative players who are capable of opening the door. ""Where Emi is at, obviously he is a lot younger, he needs to continue to work on certain parts of his game, Phil as well. But there is a big onus on them in terms of creativity and goals because they play in important positions in this team."" Villa head coach Gerrard has also backed Coutinho to rediscover his top form before the season is out. The Brazilian has failed to register a single goal contribution in his last six appearances, but Gerrard wants the 29-year-old to end the campaign on a positive note. Gerrard said: ""They got some real key blocks in on Phil today when he came in from the left he had a couple of opportunities and Norwich have defended them really well. It will click and come back without a doubt. ""He’s got quality and you can see every time he’s on the ball the excitement that he brings. He’s not going to be man of the match and on top of the world every week. ""I thought Emi came on and looked really exciting. We have got two really exciting number 10s at our disposable and we’ve got different types of number 10s. ""Danny Ings played there at moments today and he runs in behind, Leon Bailey is more of a dribbler and ball carrier. We’ve got a lot of talent and a lot of options at the top end of the pitch, but I need them all to be a little bit more ruthless. We want to kill teams more."" THE RIGHT OPTIONS UP TOP? Villa came into the clash with Norwich having lost four of their last five games, and in that time they had only scored two goals, with one of those coming from the penalty spot in the defeat at Wolves. So while Gerrard was pleased to see his side get back to winning ways and amongst the goals, he was keen to stress that a lot more work still needs to happen at Bodymoor Heath. Gerrard told BirminghamLive: ""We want to be unpredictable and have options. We changed the way we played at the beginning because we lost one of our coaches who was around the first-team, he went with part of Dean’s coaching set up so we believe they would have prepared for us to play our normal 4-2-3-1 with two 10s narrow, but we went with our 10s outside the pitch to give a different problem and something for them to think about. ""I want the top end of the pitch to be unpredictable and to have options. I want to have players that can give different problems and make us versatile about how we go about it. The back end of the team has pretty much stayed the same, we’ve had five clean sheets out of nine and two clean sheets in the last two so we’re doing a lot of things right from a defensive point of view."" Asked if he had the attackers available in his squad to carry out what he wants, Gerrard replied: ""Erm... good question. We’re always looking to improve. We want to be as ambitious as we can and I think it’s a collective responsibility to make sure they bring their talent and best version of themselves for us to be more ruthless and score more goals which I think we can. ""We missed too many opportunities today. When we had 2 v 1 or 3 v 2 I would like us to be a bit more ruthless but with more work and more time around these players I’m sure we will.""

Bailey has been unable to put a run of more than seven consecutive appearances together in the Premier League since his £30 million arrival from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer. The Jamaica international came off five minutes before half-time of the 2-0 defeat of Norwich City at Villa Park on Saturday with an ankle injury. Bailey was making his seventh straight appearance for Villa and was doing well until he had to be replaced by Danny Ings shortly before the interval. Bailey has struggled to make his mark at Villa with the 24 year-old arriving at Villa without a full pre-season and once he scored his first goal for the club against Everton in September, he picked up a quad injury.

""In terms of the extent and the damage I’m sure he’ll be MRI scanned in the next 24 to 48 hours. ""I'm really disappointed and frustrated for him because he's worked really hard to get back, he's been training ever so well. ""We wanted to give him another opportunity off the back of Leicester City to really try and keep him in the rhythm. ""You see how he started the game he nearly scores with a fantastic effort and a top save from Tim Krul and not too far after that he's got to come off the pitch. ""He's frustrated, we're frustrated and I'm sure the supporters are as well and he said there was a bit of a twist after the contact so we'll get him looked at. ""He's obviously going to be a major doubt for the next game against Burnley because it's very rare that you come off the pitch and you’re available for the next game, so we are concerned about it."" Bailey himself took to Instagram on Sunday to share a picture of himself in action during the game with a blue love heart emoji as the caption.

https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/danny-ings-aston-villa-norwich-23839559,Danny Ings gives 'underwhelming' Aston Villa verdict,"Danny Ings admits that he has endured an ""underwhelming"" first season at Aston Villa after struggling with injury and a lack of game time. The former Southampton striker joined the club in a £25million transfer last summer and was recruited as one of the three players that Villa identified to replace Jack Grealish's attacking influence. Leon Bailey and Emi Buendia also arrived, but they have all struggled to settle for one reason or another. For Ings, who scored just his sixth goal of the season in the 2-0 win over Norwich City on Saturday, he has battled with injury niggles and a lack of match fitness as a result throughout the campaign. Though, he is happy to help the team in anyway he can, even if it means playing a bit part role most weekends. READ MORE: Steven Gerrard demands more from Aston Villa forwards and drops subtle transfer hint READ MORE: Steven Gerrard makes Tim Iroegbunam promise after first Aston Villa start Ings said after the win against Norwich: ""Coming on and helping the team means a lot to me. Overall this season for me has been a little underwhelming. I am happy to come on today and help. ""This season has been very up and down, in and out. There have been things with niggles I have had. It is hard to get a rhythm. But I always try and work as hard as I can to put numbers on the board and help the team. ""I think we have a lot of talent in all the positions up top. No matter who the manager picks we all have a responsibility to create and help each other out, provide goals and assists. For me it is about working hard each game, whether I am starting or coming on."" When asked about Villa's inconsistent season, Ings replied: ""It has been a strange season. It is always difficult. We have changed managers and a lot of things have happened. But ultimately we are trying to improve individually and as a team. Hopefully we can finish the season strong."" Much has been said about Villa's struggles to fit both Ings and Ollie Watkins in the same team, but Steven Gerrard believes it can work and he has proven the duo can hit up a relationship on the pitch. They combined to score their first goal together in the 4-0 win over Southampton back in March, and managed to do it again in the win over the Canaries last time out. ""When strikers come together, things do take time,"" Ings added. ""We have had some really nice moments linking up. We have plenty to work on and keep building on but ultimately, the direction we want to go as a team, it is not just down to us to score the goals. You want goals for your 10s, you want your centre-halves scoring. I think overall everyone has to chip in with goals. ""If we apply ourselves I think we have more than enough ability in the dressing room to achieve really good things. It doesn’t happen overnight. In football it is always a process. All of us are working hard to try and achieve something. ""It is important to put as many points on the board as we can to try and finish in as strong a position as we can. That will be a good platform for next season. I think it is always our drive. You want to finish as high as you can."" ",positive,norwich

After Norwich City lost 2-0 to Aston Villa and Burnley beat fellow strugglers Watford, the Premier League's bottom side were relegated with four games left of the season. Ollie Watkins scored the opener in the first half, before Danny Ings netted his sixth goal for the campaign in second half additional time. The result means former Villa boss Smith will now turn his attentions to getting the Canaries back up and out of the Championship next season. But he was frustrated with his side's mistakes against Villa at the weekend after claiming there was a sense of inevitability about the club's relegation in the end.

""I thought we done it really well in the first half, Pierre [Lees-Melou] had a really good chance when he really should have done better. I thought we controlled the football for long periods of the game as well. As I say, a slip has cost us.""

https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/five-aston-villa-squad-issues-23838431,The five Aston Villa squad issues Steven Gerrard must sort,"Aston Villa are set for another busy transfer window this summer with plenty of outgoings and several incomings expected. Steven Gerrard will be backed in the market with owners Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens hoping the club can challenge for European football next season. Following a positive January window where the club signed Philippe Coutinho (loan), Lucas Digne and Calum Chambers, the Villa boss wants to add more quality to improve his starting XI. A holding midfielder and more defensive reinforcements are at the top of Gerrard's wish list, while Villa will also target more attacking talent, according to reports. Here are five issues that the Villa head coach must sort this summer. READ MORE: Fresh Carney Chukwuemeka transfer claims emerge amid Aston Villa uncertainty READ MORE: Philippe Coutinho has made feelings clear on Aston Villa transfer WHO WEARS THE ARMBAND? One burning question which fans might not know the answer to until the start of next season, is who will wear the captains armband when the new campaign kicks off in three months time? Gerrard isn't convinced that current skipper Tyrone Mings will keep the captaincy past the end of this season. ""I think it's really important, especially with this group of players,"" Gerrard said of the role of captaincy. ""We took over this group who were two points above a relegation fight. I think what we're looking for in terms of help and support for the group is that we need more leaders. ""We need more people who have perhaps been there and done it, and have that type of experience to come in and support a lot of the young talent we've got within the group. So, for me, I think certain teams, i.e. let's use Man City or Real Madrid who are serial winners... maybe the captaincy is not as important because they've got a manager and a level of players across the board who are world-class or in the main - and maybe the captaincy isn't as vital. ""When you take over a team in 16th and just two places above relegation and you're having passages of periods where you're looking strong and good and you're a little bit inconsistent, it's important that leadership is added to the group. It's important that leadership is retained in the group so, when I decide who's captain at the end of the season, they'll have a very important part to play and a very important role to play because we need to turn this team into a more consistent team."" Gerrard added: ""Ty was really appreciative of the opportunity to continue with the armband when I first arrived. I made it abundantly clear to him first before we put it public that that was what we were going to do. ""We needed time, with my staff, to find out who can lead. Tyrone's in with a good shout [of retaining captaincy next season] without a doubt. We've been happy with what he's given so far. But now's not the right time - with eight games to go - to pick the long-term captain of Aston Villa. ""I'll make a decision on the captaincy at the end of the season, beginning of next season, which is what I said when I was first asked about it [at the unveiling press conference in November]. I think it's always important to get in amongst the group to see what they're like every minute of every day. See who's the glue of the team; see who leads in the right way; see who leads through adversity - not just when the sun's shining. To see who's prepared to go above and beyond; see who sets the right standards on a daily basis. ""We're still working that out and I still won't rule out the option of someone coming in who I know, who's also capable of being in the running for it so it's something I'm really analysing closely now. I'll make a decision some time during pre-season before the [new] season starts."" FIRST XI CHANGES Gerrard is keen to not only bolster his squad in the summer window, but also improve on his current XI. Speaking ahead of the 2-0 win over Norwich, the Villa boss made that point clear. Gerrard said: ""What we’ve done is analyse this squad all the way through and given opportunities to everyone. We would have liked to have given more opportunities to players who have been injured, like Bertrand Traore and Leon Bailey. ""It’s also important that certain individuals are seen. There is a thinking behind a lot of opportunities but I am looking for a more settled team moving forward. ""We will be recruiting for the XI. But it’s important to play the big picture because there is no doubt there will be some people moving on and there will be incomings as well, and it’s important that both are seen. There is a thinking behind it. It’s not me wanting to chop and change and do certain things."" READ MORE: Aston Villa shortlist to fulfill Steven Gerrard's biggest transfer priority READ MORE: Five Aston Villa prospects who could leave the club on loan next season CONTRACT DILEMMAS Carney Chukwuemeka is no closer to signing a new contract with Villa, while Douglas Luiz is also yet to pen fresh terms and could leave the club this summer. Both midfielders has been given opportunities to impress Gerrard since he took over in November, though that department of his squad could look a lot different come the start of the new season. Meanwhile, veteran Ashley Young is in talks over signing a new contract and is open to extending his stay at Villa Park. The 36-year-old returned to Villa last summer and signed a one-year contract with the option of a further 12 months. Other players with contracts that are slowly running down are Anwar El Ghazi and Frederic Guilbert. Both players are currently out on loan and are expected to find permanent exits from the club when the window opens in June. COUTINHO AND/OR BUENDIA One criticism that has been fired Gerrard's way in recent weeks is down to his reluctance to give Emi Buendia enough game time to make an impact in games. The Argentine has started just one of Villa's last nine matches, but has still managed to produce two assists in that time. Gerrard told BirminghamLive about the playmaker: ""We’ve got a real strong relationship with Emi, we’re happy that he is here. He’s fighting on a daily basis for more game time, obviously them opportunities have come from the bench of late, but he has started a lot of games initially when I first came in. ""So the challenge is very much there for him when he gets the opportunity, whether that’s from the start or from the side, we’re looking for that creative contribution from him, goals or assists. That’s the best way for him to start winning a starting shirt consistently and deliver and execute and get numbers in the game."" Gerrard added: ""He works extremely hard every day, he’s tenacious and warrior-like in how he goes about it. A lot of our forward players have got to continue trying to keep the crowd in the right place, they have to deliver and execute in the final third, that’s what they get paid to do. But that’s not just at Emi, it’s all of our goal scorers, our wingers, our tens, our attacking players. ""We’ve got a lot of talent in the building but the reality is we’re not scoring enough goals of late, that’s what we’re expecting. We’re expecting them to push and score or create in big moments to put us in a better place in the league."" Asked whether Buendia can play in the same team as fellow playmaker Coutinho, Gerrard replied: ""At certain times, against certain opponents, I have seen it work before. But not in every game, I think they are quite similar, but what you have got is two creative players who are capable of opening the door. ""Where Emi is at, obviously he is a lot younger, he needs to continue to work on certain parts of his game, Phil as well. But there is a big onus on them in terms of creativity and goals because they play in important positions in this team."" Villa head coach Gerrard has also backed Coutinho to rediscover his top form before the season is out. The Brazilian has failed to register a single goal contribution in his last six appearances, but Gerrard wants the 29-year-old to end the campaign on a positive note. Gerrard said: ""They got some real key blocks in on Phil today when he came in from the left he had a couple of opportunities and Norwich have defended them really well. It will click and come back without a doubt. ""He’s got quality and you can see every time he’s on the ball the excitement that he brings. He’s not going to be man of the match and on top of the world every week. ""I thought Emi came on and looked really exciting. We have got two really exciting number 10s at our disposable and we’ve got different types of number 10s. ""Danny Ings played there at moments today and he runs in behind, Leon Bailey is more of a dribbler and ball carrier. We’ve got a lot of talent and a lot of options at the top end of the pitch, but I need them all to be a little bit more ruthless. We want to kill teams more."" THE RIGHT OPTIONS UP TOP? Villa came into the clash with Norwich having lost four of their last five games, and in that time they had only scored two goals, with one of those coming from the penalty spot in the defeat at Wolves. So while Gerrard was pleased to see his side get back to winning ways and amongst the goals, he was keen to stress that a lot more work still needs to happen at Bodymoor Heath. Gerrard told BirminghamLive: ""We want to be unpredictable and have options. We changed the way we played at the beginning because we lost one of our coaches who was around the first-team, he went with part of Dean’s coaching set up so we believe they would have prepared for us to play our normal 4-2-3-1 with two 10s narrow, but we went with our 10s outside the pitch to give a different problem and something for them to think about. ""I want the top end of the pitch to be unpredictable and to have options. I want to have players that can give different problems and make us versatile about how we go about it. The back end of the team has pretty much stayed the same, we’ve had five clean sheets out of nine and two clean sheets in the last two so we’re doing a lot of things right from a defensive point of view."" Asked if he had the attackers available in his squad to carry out what he wants, Gerrard replied: ""Erm... good question. We’re always looking to improve. We want to be as ambitious as we can and I think it’s a collective responsibility to make sure they bring their talent and best version of themselves for us to be more ruthless and score more goals which I think we can. ""We missed too many opportunities today. When we had 2 v 1 or 3 v 2 I would like us to be a bit more ruthless but with more work and more time around these players I’m sure we will.""

https://www.football365.com/news/man-utd-keane-hits-out-burnley-over-top-celebrations-watford,Man Utd legend Keane hits out at Burnley for their ‘over the top’ celebrations at Watford,"Roy Keane thinks the Burnley celebrations in their 2-1 victory over Watford at the weekend were “slightly over the top”. An own goal from James Tarkowski had the Clarets 1-0 down at Vicarage Road on Saturday before late goals from Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill turned the game on its head. The comeback victory lifted them five points clear of the relegation zone before Everton beat Chelsea 1-0 on Sunday to close the gap back up to two points. Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature Michael Jackson has now won three matches in a row as caretaker manager after Burnley sacked Sean Dyche last month but Keane thought their celebrations gotunnecessarily out of hand. Keane said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football: “Big win obviously to come from a goal down, you see the reaction there. Obviously I don’t mind the manager celebrating but when I see everyone hugging and kissing I think it’s just slightly over the top.” Presenter Dave Jones interjected: “These are big results at stake aren’t they?” Keane continued: “I know, I know. But there has been all season. I think Dyche would’ve got the same results I really do but, listen, the decision is made now but there’s been a good reaction.” Jones then touched on Burnley’s good form and asked Jamie Carragher if that trend is continuing, to which the former Liverpool defender replied: “Yeah, I mean, I think Roy is right, we said that last week. Sometimes a different voice, maybe a slight change, you think of the impact it has maybe had on Dwight McNeil. “He did a great job, Sean Dyche, but it’s something a little bit different. If you just look at the numbers, and of course we’re only talking about four games, so that can be skewed because that’s such a great start. “But when you see the points and the goals, there’s obviously a huge uplift there because they’ve had such a great start. But I think the thing you look at when you go down is goals conceded as well and that’s something you always looked at with Sean Dyche’s team. “I see everyone hugging and kissing – I think it’s slightly over the top” 😤 Roy Keane was NOT happy with these Burnley celebrations ❌ pic.twitter.com/dH1Zhksa7E — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 2, 2022 “But, as I said, it’s only four games.

So it looks like the manager is trying to put his own stamp on it. He’s going to try and keep the good things of Sean Dyche, keeping it right, but they’re playing a bit more football. “So they’ve almost changed slightly to play a bit more football, shall we say…”  ",positive,norwich
https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-ten-players-down-back-premier-league-sofa-thriving-gomez,Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving,"As the Premier League season enters its final weeks, clubs have started looking deeper into their squads to find a few hidden first-team gems. 10) Juan Mata (Manchester United) The sofa is knackered and living off past glories, while the item dredged from its innards is a little wornand being imminently shifted, but it remains perfectly serviceable and somehow incredibly handsome for an inanimate object. Juan Mata joined the reigning Premier League champions for a club-record fee and will leave them stranded in the Europa League, yet the Spaniard’s reputation has not been even vaguely damaged by eight-and-a-half years wasted at Old Trafford. It seemed to take Manchester United that long and almost as many managers to figure out how best to utilise Mata, who excelled as a No.10 against Brentford on his 15th Premier League start in the last three seasons. Considering those who have been permitted to float around in the sea of mediocrity and been rewarded, his relative lack of recent use has been startling. This renaissance itself is pointless, coming as it does so soon before his departure as a free agent. Yet the contrast between how well Manchester United play with Mata in the side compared to their disjointed performances without a player of his calibre remains telling.  9)Fabian Delph (Everton)The use of players on deals with a looming expiration date can often be polarising. But Everton supporters will likely give no second thought to Fabian Delph’s contract status, provided he continues to help in their quest for survival. The midfielder started three of 19 Premier League matches under Rafael Benitez and none of Duncan Ferguson’s single-game interim reign. Frank Lampard appreciates the “honesty” of a two-time title winner and hoped in April that Delph would be capable of “carrying on with what he did against Manchester United” before necessary discussions over his future were held. The 32-year-old has held up his end of the bargain, replicating those leadership qualities and defensive instincts that thwarted United in a 1-0 win at Goodison Park to secure the same result against Chelsea. Delph also started the 1-1 draw at home to Leicester and will retain that starting place provided his hamstrings hold up.  8)Tim Iroegbunam (Aston Villa)“I thought Tim had some really good moments today. I think you can see the profile, what he is going to become,” said Steven Gerrard, who added after Tim Iroregbunam’s full senior debut against Norwich: “We need him to realise that he is a first-team player. He needs to use his voice more, he needs to keep pushing himself on a daily basis.” There are worse former Premier League midfielders to receive constructive praise from. A cynic might argue thatIroregbunam’s reward for being able to “out-train certain individuals” was timed impeccably for the visit of Norwich, yet the 18-year-old embraced the challenge and further smoothed that pathway Jacob Ramsey first trod. Iroegbunam was upgraded from four Premier League minutes against Brighton in February to a quarter of an hour at Leicester and then a start in the Norwich victory, having been an unused substitute in 14 of the prior 16 fixtures. He failed to make the squad altogether in the other two; that is unlikely to happen again soon.   7)Nathan Collins (Burnley)The alchemy of Sean Dyche might have wavered at Turf Moor but the last season of signings during his reign could have established Burnley’s spine for the next few years. Maxwel Cornet and Wout Weghorst have finally added some new dimensions to the attack, while Aaron Lennon and Wayne Hennessey have been useful enough as elder statesmen. But the purchases of Championship prospects Connor Roberts and Nathan Collins may be the most important of all; both were eased into the side and neither look likely to relinquish their places. Collins has been a particularly influential arrival. Burnley have won five and drawn four of the 14 Premier League games he has started; they have won two and drawn nine of the 20 he has not. Dyche never gave the centre-half more than three consecutive starts but Collins has not missed a single minute of Mike Jackson and company’s caretaker reign. The 21-year-old’s impact has even allowed Ben Mee to step comfortably into that role and the forthcoming exit of James Tarkowski need no longer be of great concern. The reimagining of Burnley’s defence has already started.  6)Oleksandr Zinchenko (Manchester City)The third signing of Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City tenure still has his uses to the Spaniard almost six years later. His first, Ilkay Gundogan, has become a midfield lynchpin at the Etihad, while Nolito was the opening transfer misfire of this monumental reign. Oleksandr Zinchenko’s first-team relevance has never been particularly settled – the most appearances the Ukrainian has ever made in a single Premier League season is 20 – but he can still be relied upon when needed. That has been a little less often this season. Fifteen starts in all competitions represents a low return for Zinchenko, whose Manchester City minutes for the campaign rank in between those of the similarly peripheral Nathan Ake and the fading Fernandinho. The only teams to beat Guardiola’s side when Zinchenko has started are West Ham, Leipzig and Liverpool, stretched across three different competitions. As the season reaches suffocatingly pressurised levels at the top, the 25-year-old can still slot in at a moment’s notice with no discernible detriment in quality.  5) Joe Gomez (Liverpool)The full circle that has been Joe Gomez under Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool is close to completion. Injuries scuppered the defender’s development initially and are the primary reason for his current role as dual back-up. When the German first brought Gomez, it was as a right-back in 2017/18, designed to eventually share the right-back position with Trent Alexander-Arnold by the end of the season. His current status seems to be generally restricted to filling in when the Liverpool academy product needs a rest. Perhaps next he will rekindle the fruitful centre-back partnership with Virgil van Dijk upon which the Reds won the Premier League title. The list of clubs Gomez has started against is revealing: Milan, Benfica, Watford, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest, Preston, Leicester and Norwich three times. It reflects his bit-part function in this winning machine. But Klopp has challenged his squad players to be “ready for the moment when the situation changes” and throughout his regular appraisals of those on the fringes, Gomez is almost always the first to be mentioned. The 24-year-old would start in most other Premier League defences; serving consistent time on the Anfield sidelines will not be a permanent arrangement either way. 4)Mads Bech Sorensen (Brentford)Sixteen Brentford players have featured more often than Mads Bech Sorensen so far this season, but the Danish centre-half might slowly be rising to prominence. Before Boxing Day his campaign was limited to 19 minutes of the opening win against Arsenal. He then started three straight games until January 2, was benched for a couple more matches and returned to face Manchester United as February approached. Ten consecutive fixtures either on the bench or out of the squad altogether followed, before Ethan Pinnock’s injury at Watford opened a first-team door that had been irregularly blowing barely ajar for months. Sorensen finished that Vicarage Road victory, retained his place in the goalless draw against Tottenham and was arguably the best Brentford defender on show at Manchester United, even if that bar remains low in a 3-0 defeat. He,Saman Ghoddos andMads Roerslev have been critical utility players who might have earned Thomas Frank’s trust during their respective stop-start campaigns.  3)Nathaniel Clyne (Crystal Palace)It has been a curious few years for Nathaniel Clyne. Brendan Rodgers signed one of the Premier League’s most dependable right-backs for Liverpool in 2015, and while Klopp might have been plotting an internal upgrade at some point, it was injury that eventually took him out of the side. A back problem suffered in summer 2017 effectively ended Clyne’s time as a regular starter; another pre-season injury, this time to his cruciate knee ligament in July 2019, signalled his quiet farewell the following year. The 31-year-old had left Crystal Palace for Southampton in 2012 but came back as a free agent and trialist by October 2020, training with his former club to regain fitness and soon a 12-month contract that was renewed last August. Clyne has had to accept a subsidiary role under both Roy Hodgson and Patrick Vieira; he didn’t feature in the Premier League from February to December 2021. But an injury to Joel Ward presented an opening that has reinvigorated the erstwhile England international’s career. Clyne’s current run of 10 consecutive Premier League starts is his longest in five years and an enduring testament to his fortitude. Even if Palace intend on sourcing an improvement at right-back in the transfer market, they could do worse than renew Clyne’s terms as a trustworthy reserve. Nathaniel Clyne appreciation tweet The guy doesn’t stop trying, goes about his business quietly, and has been absolutely solid for us Proper palace ❤️💙 pic.twitter.com/rOfwPYvqRH — Benj (@Beniesta_) April 30, 2022   2)Moises Caicedo (Brighton)Graham Potter perhaps understood the unique pressure of having to live up to such a daunting Barclays surname. Felipe Caicedo struck terror into the heart of Premier League defences for two years at Manchester City and surnamesake Moises would have to carry that burden for the rest of his career. Brighton signed the midfielder for £4.5m in February 2021, sat him on the bench as an unused substitute in five Premier League and FA Cup games, nodded astutely as his Ecuador side reached the Copa America quarter-finals, then sent him on loan to Beerschot in Belgium for some season-long fine-tuning. Except Caicedo would return to the coast sooner than planned. An injury to Enock Mwepu and the loss of Yves Bissouma to Africa Cup of Nations duty led to a midfield shortage at Brighton, the solution to which was a January recall for Caicedo. The Seagulls battled through that period regardless and only for the trip to Arsenal did the 20-year-old finally get his long-awaited debut. Brighton’s seven-game winless run was curtailed at the Emirates as Caicedo shone, assisting one goal and displaying the sort of quality Potter has found impossible to resist since. The midfielder has started each of the subsequent four matches as the next stage of Brighton’s transformation comes into full view.  1) Mo Elneny (Arsenal)“Maybe there wasn’t a lot of competition because we were the only club interested in signing him. Not too many people spoke about him and he was basically not much on the radar,” said Arsene Wenger, really milking the excitement of the Arsenal fanbasein January 2016. Plenty of teams have pursued the Egyptian since, from Leicester to Galatasaray and, most recently, Newcastle. A productive year was spent at Besiktas, yet the Turkish giants thought better of exercising their buy option. And so Elneny returned in summer 2020, farmed out under Unai Emery and inherited by Mikel Arteta. The Spaniard has consummate faith in Elneny to deliver when called upon. He started the Community Shield final win over Liverpool almost two years ago, as well as wins at Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge. Heading into this season it was believed that the midfielder would finally leave, yet even when Arteta culled the squad with ruthless abandon, he knew Elneny would be needed at some point. The Egyptian’s only Premier League starts this campaign have come against Manchester United (twice), Chelsea and West Ham and no player has been more crucial to their turnaround over the past fortnight. Elneny’s contract is scheduled to expire this summer but, by his own admission: “If Arsenal say ‘we want you’ I don’t think about leaving. It’s my family for six years. I love this club.'” Arteta will reciprocate that fondness; he could not find a better or more committed and reliable squad option if he tried.  ",positive,norwich
https://www.football365.com/news/champions-league-preview-ancelotti-liverpool-west-ham-abraham,"Big Midweek: Carlo ‘The Don’ Ancelotti, Liverpool, Tammy Abraham, Frankfurt v West Ham","A likely Liverpool procession, Carlo ‘The Don’ Ancelotti, one of the many Chelsea lads to get away and West Ham head to Frankfurt. We preview a Big Midweek of European semi-final action… Game to watch: Eintracht Frankfurt v West Ham It’s a huge game for both sides. Frankfurt have a one-goal advantage as they look to book their place in a first European final for 41 years, while the Hammers’ wait has been five years longer still. David Moyes’ side weren’t quite at it in the first leg. They weren’t overawed per se, but looked a bit taken aback by Frankfurt, who produced an excellent away performance. West Ham should be reasonably well rested as Moyes has shuffled his pack in the Premier League and they need to be at their assertive, physical best to make it through. The importance of winning this game, and then the final, isn’t limited to the joy of winning, though that is obviously the most important thing. Both clubs have players in the shop window who want, and have the quality, to be playing European football, and all face the prospect of that not being the case if they remain with their respective clubs. Frankfurt are tenth in the Bundesliga and completely out of the running for European qualification. West Ham currently sit in the Europa Conference League spot in the Premier League, which is lovely, but quite possibly not enough for Declan Rice, or perhaps Jarrod Bowen, both of whom have the quality to be playing at the very highest level.They’ve played a huge part in West Ham getting this far, but could well be off should they not take them all the way.  Team to watch: Liverpool Liverpool are playing football like they’re a driver on a boring stretch of motorway. The monotony makes you forget hours of driving to the extent that you wonder whether you’ve been asleep at the wheel, but you’re still there, getting closer and closer to a destination that seemed an impossible dream when you set off. Tuesday’s second leg against Villarreal will be Liverpool’s 58th game of the season. They’ve won 44 of them and lost just three, including the 1-0 second-leg defeat to Inter Milan which ultimately didn’t matter. They’ve been tediously brilliant, with so many of those games forgettable as they blend into one. Trent Alexander-Arnold plays some unbelievable passes, one or more of their five outstanding forwards has an outstanding game, the opposition get caught offside 25 times and Alisson gets them out of jail when he needs to. OK guys, fine, we get it! Unai Emery said his side have to be “perfect” to overcome the two-goal deficit, but they also need Liverpool to have a bit of a shocker, and they just haven’t at any point this season. The baying Yellow Submarine fans can have an impact, but the combination of skill, know-how and maturity in Jurgen Klopp’s side is unmatched in world football, other than perhaps Manchester City, and it’s hard to see anything but the usual, mind-numbingly excellent routine.  Manager to watch: Carlo Ancelotti Ancelotti, who became the first manager to win all of the ‘big five’ league titles over the weekend, will move above Bob Paisley and Zinedine Zinedine to stand alone as the only manager to win four European Cups/Champions League titles should he take Madrid all the way this year. Given they will have to beat Manchester City in the second leg, and then likely Liverpool in the final to achieve the feat, it doesn’t feel likely. But then nothing about their run this season has been likely. Real Madrid have smashed and grabbed their way to this point in the Champions League. It feels as though they’ve been the better team for about half a game of football combined in the knockout phase so far. They’ve seen off eminently superior Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea sides and are somehow within touching distance of Manchester City having been battered in the first leg at the Etihad. In the five knockout legs combined, Ancelotti’s side have scored 11 goals from an xG of 5.5; their opponents have scored ten goals from an xG of 11.76… Ancelotti, mehn. What a legend. pic.twitter.com/d1E0LAP0Lj — Luis Miguel Echegaray (@lmechegaray) May 1, 2022  There’s been a spattering of Luka Modric genius, but their progress has relied hugely on Karim ‘The Dream’ Benzema,who’s scored 14 goals in the competition at a ridiculous rate of one every 65 minutes. The striker was rested as Madrid clinched the La Liga title on Saturday, still managing to score as a second-half substitute, as Ancelotti saved his 34-year-old legs ahead of the clash at the Bernabeu on Wednesday. Ancelotti isn’t one to overthink games of football like Pep Guardiola, and there’s a sense this year that he’s embraced the chaos that can give his team the advantage. He backs his star players, and one in particular, to win the big moments and score goals at key times. And it’s hard not to root for this Real Madrid side, firstly because they’re so damn entertaining, and secondly because Ancelotti is a gentleman, a scholar and an absolute Don.  Player to watch: Tammy Abraham If embarrassment was no factor, Chelsea would currently be heavily linked with a move for Tammy Abraham. 24 goals so far this season, a lover of and loved by Jose Mourinho, someone who ‘knows the club’, with Premier League experience. It would be a ‘no-brainer’ that ultimately, inevitably, would end with the assertion that perhaps brains were in fact necessary. He, like Romelu Lukaku, isn’t suited to Thomas Tuchel’s system, but Mourinho is making the most of him. It’s been Abraham’s link-up play, along with his goals, that’s been so impressive, and was the talking point and social media obsession after the 1-1 draw at Leicester in the first leg. Tammy Playmaking 🎨@tammyabraham pic.twitter.com/Vs2aca7yxA — ASRomaComps (@roma_comps) April 29, 2022  And with the renewed confidence and form that has put him in with a very decent shout of heading to the World Cup in Qatar with England this winter, few would bet against the 24-year-old being the scourge of Brendan Rodgers’ side again on Thursday night.  EFL game to watch: Bournemouth v Nottingham Forest Those of you who don’t fancy watching a Liverpool procession on Tuesday can instead turn your attention to what could be the Championship automatic promotion decider. When Steve Cooper took charge of Forest eight games into the season, on September 21, they were bottom of the table on four points; Bournemouth were top on 18. Forest are now third and should they win at the Vitality Stadium, will swap places with Bournemouth, pulling the Cherries out of the automatic promotion spots for the first time since the day Cooper arrived. The closest Premier League equivalent would be Dean Smith taking Norwich to the Champions League having taken over from Daniel Farke. There is no superlative grand enough to describe how good Cooper has been.   European game to watch: Salernitana v Venezia It looks like it’s going to the wire at the top and bottom of Serie A. While the Milan clubs battle for the title, four clubs are vying for 17th spot to avoid relegation. It’s Salernitana in 18th against Venezia in 20th on Thursday and the away side desperately need a win. Venezia are six points off Cagliari and safety with four games to play, having not picked up a single point since mid-February after a shocking nine defeats on the bounce.Salernitana have a better chance of avoiding the drop – they sit just three points behind Cagliari with two games in hand.

The Portugal captain is the Red Devils’ top scorer this season with 23 goals in 37 appearances across all competitions. Five ways for Man Utd to salvage what’s left of this wretched season He has scored five in his last three games – including a hat-trick against Norwich City on April 16. Despite his stellar goalscoring season, Ronaldo’s future is up in the air with Ten Hag replacing Ralf Rangnick in the dugout at the end of 2021/22. As per the Mirror, the Dutch manager is keen on building around ‘energy and youth’ with a big summer squad overhaul on the cards. They say that Ronaldo is ‘not guaranteed’ to play every game under Ten Hag, which will not sit well with the club legend who has scored 17 times in the Premier League since his return to Man Utd last summer. Real Madrid want Cristiano Ronaldo to return to the club this summer 🤯 [The Mirror] pic.twitter.com/JkD8pbPZ6k — GOAL (@goal) May 1, 2022 A return to Real Madrid could come to fruition this summer with the Spanish champions ‘more than open’ to re-signing the 37-year-old. Ronaldo wouldn’t cost any more than a £10m up-front fee. He scored 450 goals in 438 games for Los Blancos. The La Liga giants are keen on signing Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappe – who is out of contract at the end of the season. Speaking earlier this week, PSG boss Mauricio Pochettino claimed that he and Mbappe will both be at the club next season. Asked in a press conference what the likelihood of him and the French forward being at the club next term was, he replied: “100 per cent in both cases.” Pochettino, who was overlooked for the Man Utd job, added: “That is how I feel today. That is what I can say to you today. I can’t say anything else. That is how I feel right now. “This is football and we never know what might happen. But I have to answer the question based on how I feel today. And that is what I have done.” ",positive,norwich
https://www.football365.com/news/bent-disagrees-arsenal-fans-over-huge-arteta-future-call,Pundit ‘disagrees’ with ‘a lot of Arsenal fans’ over huge Mikel Arteta decision,"Darren Bent would like to see Mikel Arteta stay in charge of Arsenal next season regardless of how they do during the rest of the season. The Spaniard’s time at the Emirates Stadium has been full of highs and lows with the Gunners winning the FA Cup in his first six months in charge. It was disappointing first full season in charge at Arsenal for Arteta as they finished eighth in the Premier League, missing out on qualification for Europe. Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature However, six new signings last summer helped Arteta remould his squad for this season and they are now favourites to finish fourth and secure Champions League football for next term. Arsenal – who beat West Ham 2-1 on Sunday – are currently two points ahead of Tottenham with four games left of the season, including a north London derby, which could go a long way to deciding who will finish fourth. Despite that, there are still a number of doubters among the Arsenal fanbase that Arteta is the right man to lead the club forward in the long term, but Bent thinks they should keep the faith. Bent said on talkSPORT: “There are still a lot of Arsenal fans who are unsure about Mikel Arteta being in charge of Arsenal Football Club. “They still think, come the end of the season, regardless of whether Arsenal are in the Champions League or not, he should not be the manager to take them forward. “I completely disagree. I think he is the right manager to take them forward. He’s earned the right to move into next season, certainly if Arsenal are in the Champions League.” Meanwhile, former Arsenal striker Kevin Campbell claims that Nicolas Pepe, who has been linked with a move away from the club in recent weeks, doesn’t have a future at the Emirates Stadium. Campbell told Football Insider: “Arsenal paid over the odds for him. “It has just not worked out. It is that simple. He is a talented player, that’s for sure. But it has not worked out for him. “You see the intensity and focus that Mikel Arteta wants the team to play with. I don’t think Pepe fits into that. He is a drifter. He will concentrate for a bit and then drift out again. “I said just before Christmas it was a big few months coming up for Pepe. It was going to determine whether or not he had a future at Arsenal. Well, he doesn’t have a future at Arsenal.” ",positive,norwich
https://www.football365.com/news/decision-time-one-loanee-dilemma-saliba-van-de-beek?utm_source=Recirculation&utm_medium=WP_Related_Articles_Unit&utm_campaign=Benchmark,Decision time: One loanee per club sparking a dilemma,"A genuinely interminable international break plus a France debut for William Saliba was all the encouragement we needed to embark on a quest to identify one player per Premier League club currently out on loan who, for better or worse, has given his parent club a decision to make… Arsenal: William Saliba The Gunners have a whole gaggle of assorted players out on loan, and, despite the intriguing existence of Folarin Balogun as a striker whose Arsenal contract isn’t about to expire, the most interesting loanee is once again William Saliba. He was here last year and if anything the intrigue has only grown. He has now had three hugely successful years as an Arsenal player; he just hasn’t spent any of them at Arsenal. Loans at St Etienne, Nice and now Marseille have even earned him his first caps for France. Friendly caps might not seem all that big a deal, but winning a cap for France as a centre-back is just about the toughest task in the entire sport; Aymeric Laporte found it so difficult he had to become Spanish instead; Ibrahima Konate still hasn’t managed it. Saliba, the man apparently surplus to requirements at Arsenal, has done it. He is understandably happy and settled at Marseille, where he plays every game, and a return to Arsenal would mean fighting for a place with Gabriel and Ben White. A lot depends on the player, but with only two years left on the five-year contract Saliba signed as a teenager, Arsenal are now very much at the point where it’s time to sh*t or get off the pot.  Aston Villa: Matt Targett One of many players currently on loan – along with Keinan Davis, Trezeguet, Anwar El Ghazi and Frederic Guilbert – who Villa are seemingly happy to move on permanently in the summer. Targett is key, because it appears relatively straightforward to do a deal with Newcastle that suits all parties while also bringing in a reasonably sizeable transfer fee – something in the order of £15m has been mooted – to help bankroll Steven Gerrard’s ambitious summer masterplan of spending £60m on Kalvin Phillips.  Brentford: Marcus Forss The Finland striker was in the squad for every one of Brentford’s first 23 Premier League games. But he started just one of those, getting off the bench in just six others and never for more than 30-odd minutes. He scored no goals. He went back to the Championship on loan with Hull in January and has managed just a single goal in eight appearances for the Tigers. He’s still got four years left on his Brentford contract; it’s hard to see how he can be part of what will almost certainly again be a Premier League squad next year, but you can also see why he’d be reluctant to leave the security of that long-term contract. Another loan?  Brighton: Kjell Scherpen The Seagulls have 13 players out on loan like some kind of petrodollar superclub. At least one of these will definitely be in the squad next season, surely – striker Deniz Undav who has scored only one league goal fewer for shock Belgian league title contenders Union Saint Gilloise before and after a January sale-and-return move than his new Brighton team-mates have managed to put together in the Premier League. A more interesting one might be giant back-up keeper Scherpen, who might have been doing a more important off-field role in the first half of the season than many realised. Scherpen spent the first half of the season watching Robert Sanchez be very good indeed and is now on loan while Sanchez makes repeated bollocks of things as Brighton’s season threatens to end with the sort of whimper that can have alarming knock-on effects the following year if not addressed. Even if he doesn’t play a single game, Scherpen might be worth keeping around the place.  Burnley: Bailey Peacock-Farrell We’re not spoiled for choice here. It’s a third-choice goalkeeper or a fourth-choice goalkeeper. Let’s go with Peacock-Farrell who is doing a decent enough job in nets for fallen giants Sheffield Wednesday as they look to clamber out of League One. Our main observation is that it doesn’t matter how many games of football he plays or at what level. No matter how high his career goes we will never, ever, ever accept that Bailey Peacock-Farrell is not in fact the name of a rugby player who, after six successful years in Super League, crosses codes to join Bath or whatever and make eight appearances for England in the 15-man game.  Chelsea: Conor Gallagher There is not a single Chelsea player currently on loan at Vitesse, which is perhaps why the whole world currently seems to be desperately trying to spin itself off its axis. It’s just not right or normal, is it? Chelsea do, though, have about a million players out on loan as is customary. Now the whole global unpleasantness is of particular relevance to Chelsea, who may not in fact have any choice to make over who stays or goes or heads out on loan. They may not even exist next season. Probably they will, though. And probably they will get to decide these things. Which means a decision to make on Gallagher, who has been one of the most exciting and enjoyable players in the Premier League this season. We’re big fans of players who get to that level and still seem to visibly enjoy playing the game. Palace would, clearly, dearly love to keep him and you do get a keen sense that this is now someone who needs to be playing regularly. You can’t keep him on the bench, released only for the odd runaround in a Carabao or non-vital European game. He’s tasted regular top-level football now and found it entirely to his liking. At the very least, you’d think he needs to spend another year on loan playing all the football.  Crystal Palace: Luke Plange Palace only have two players currently out on loan and it’s fair to say their summer thoughts might be rather more exercised by what happens next to the player they currently have on loan (see above). Anyway, the two options are a) 23-year-old American Jacob Montes who has spent the entirety of his slightly odd one-year Palace contract pulling up no trees in a pair of half-season loans in the Belgian second division and therefore b) Luke Plange, the teenager whose breakthrough at Derby convinced Palace to make a buy-and-return move in January. Palace have a bit of form for developing Football League talent into Premier League players, but you’d imagine that’s probably a way off yet. A good Championship loan seems the likeliest option next season.  Everton: Moise Kean In theory, he’s still in the first year of a two-year loan at Juventus with an obligation to buy at the end of it. In theory. In reality, Juventus weren’t right sure a while ago and since signing Dusan Vlahovic are less convinced still about the merits of Kean who has scored just four goals in 24 Serie A games this season. All the noise suggests Juventus are looking to get out of the current arrangement and send Kean back to Goodison this summer, an outcome that we have to imagine absolutely nobody else involved wants. So whatever happens next it should be fun to see what comes of it all.  Leeds: Helder Costa In and out of the side at Valencia but has made no secret of the fact he’s happier in Spain and would like to make his move permanent if everyone else is up for it. They probably will be. “I feel better here, I came from a not so good situation (at Leeds). But Valencia have given me the opportunity to relaunch my career and I think this is the ideal place to do that,” Costa toldSuper Sport last year.   Leicester City: Dennis Praet A victim of the Dreaded Metatarsal, which has kept him out of the Torino side for a couple of months at a frustrating time and appears likely now to be a season-ender. The Belgian is apparently happy in Turin and keen to stay, but the Italian side seem keen to use his injury as a means to drive down the agreed £12.5m option price in the current loan arrangement. Reports from the Italian end suggest Torino might favour another loan over an outright purchase but, with just two year left on his Leicester contract, you’d imagine the Foxes would want something more concrete built into that. An obligation that kicks in once a set number of appearances is reached or some such thing. We don’t know. We’re not contract negotiators.  Liverpool: Nathaniel Phillips It’s between Phillips and Neco Williams here. Both will still have three years left on their contracts in the summer. Both are on loan at high-flying Championship clubs. Both have obvious talent. Both face significant top-quality barriers to their first-team progression at Anfield. But it’s Phillips, five years Williams’ senior, for whom the clock is more conspicuously ticking. Phillips did an admirable job in that desperate half-season for Liverpool last year when all their other centre-backs fell over, but is that situation going to present itself again? Should Bournemouth confirm promotion back to the Premier League, and that appears almost certain now given their sizeable cushion in both points and games in hand over third-placed Luton, you’d imagine both player and club might be keen on a more permanent arrangement. Ticklish thing there is that longish contract, half a season of decent Premier League football behind him and apparent absence of any option in his loan contract. What would Liverpool want for him? £15m is a number that has been touted, and if anything you’d be surprised if it was that low really.  Manchester City: Pedro Porro Just the 13 City players currently plying their trade elsewhere at the mo. Spain right-back Porro is perhaps the most interesting of those, currently in the second half of a successful two-year stint in Lisbon with Sporting that has already brought one league title and could yet bring another if a six-point gap to Porto can be overturned. Eight goals and nine assists from 65 games played predominantly at right wing-back are eye-catching numbers.  Manchester United: Donny van de Beek The arrival of a new manager in the summer means all things are a bit up in the air for United’s current loanees, who could suddenly find themselves far more in favour when a new man arrives. We suspect minds have been made up now, though, about Anthony Martial. Van de Beek is an intriguing one, though. Especially if United’s new manager does turn out to be his former Ajax gaffer Erik Ten Hag in spite of Louis van Gaal’s mischief-making. Van de Beek is clearly a talent, but whether he can crack it here remains in some doubt. What is not is that he is yet to be presented with an environment to categorically prove it one way or the other. In hindsight – and, if we’re honest, foresight – packing him off to Frank Lampard’s Everton Circus might not have been a brilliant idea. We’re still really none the wiser about him.  Newcastle: Freddie Woodman If you were loaned out by Newcastle in January then really it’s a pretty clear hint about where your future lies. For Woodman, who played four Premier League games at the start of the season, it’s meant sitting on the bench for promotion-chasing Bournemouth as back-up to Mark Travers. It is the seventh loan of his Newcastle career, and he has one year left on his contract at St James’ Park. At 25, it’s surely time for a permanent move to go and be first choice somewhere even if it means dropping down a tier or two.  Norwich: Todd Cantwell Like Norwich themselves, he’s pretty good at getting into the Premier League but not so good at staying there. With his current loan club Bournemouth set to once again swap divisions with parent club Norwich, the logical conclusion is surely for Cantwell to go back to Norwich and complete what would be the genuinely novel achievement of a third successive promotion from the Championship. Bournemouth do, though, hold the option of making the move permanent and spoiling everything.  Southampton: Dan N’Lundulu Because there is literally nobody else other than a 23-year-old striker who scored two goals in 20 League One appearances across a pair of loans at first Lincoln and then Cheltenham before suffering a season-ending hamstring injury.  Tottenham: Bryan Gil Spurs have seven players out on loan, and with most of them the future looks pretty clear one way or the other. It would be a major surprise were Tanguy Ndombele or Giovani Lo Celso to have futures in north London, which is a shame but also probably for the best. Neither has been missed since January. Jack Clarke was Spurs’ attempt at a moneyball signing and it’s not worked out. Cameron Carter-Vickers is likely to make his loan move to Celtic permanent. Pape Sarr, the teenage midfield sensation bought from and loaned straight back to Metz last summer, will require a decision but not a final one. The suspicion there is that he’ll spend pre-season with Spurs before either being brought into the first-team squad or sent on another loan. Spurs, you’d imagine, would prefer that to be to either a bottom-half Premier League club or ambitious Championship side (let’s face it, it will probably be Norwich) to find out how he goes in English football. But the big decision probably regards Bryan Gil, the skilful yet painfully lightweight Spanish winger who just looked nowhere near the right sort of fit for English football. His current loan in Spain cannot tell us much but he is the one player on the Spurs list where all things are possible. This time next year he could just as easily be a Spurs first-team regular, starring for Valencia in La Liga having joined on a permanent basis, doing bits for Crystal Palace on loan or languishing at Tottenham having subsisted on the occasional Europa night which is no longer an option because Spurs have found some new and absurdly Spursy way to get knocked out. Watford: Philip Zinckernagel The Hornets look to be on to a good thing whatever happens here thanks to Zinckernagel’s Nottingham Forest exploits. He’s scored five goals and laid on nine assists to help Forest into the play-off picture, but it’s his eye-catching displays in Forest’s fabulous FA Cup run that really make you take notice. If Watford stay up, then he has shown he can play at Premier League level. If they go down, then he has shown he can propel a Championship promotion bid. And if Watford go down and Forest go up, then they might be able to sell him for a nice price. Win, win, win. If you ignore the whole ‘relegation’ stuff, which is not a win and frankly a bit of a downer.  West Ham: Conor Coventry Because he’s the only West Ham player currently out on loan. They really don’t have a very big squad. The 22-year-old spent the first half of this season in the lower reaches of the Championship, making 12 appearances – mainly off the bench – for Peterborough, and is now in League One with MK Dons. Has just a year left on his contract at West Ham, for whom he has made three brief appearances off the bench in the League Cup.  Wolves: Adama Traore All appeared sorted when he set off to Barcelona initially on loan with a £29m option to make it permanent in the summer. Four assists in 10 games have gone some way to confirming the suspicion that his end-product stats might improve away from Wolves but there is yet a fly in the ointment thanks to Barcelona’s much-publicised financial problems making that £29m a bit steep for them. Wolves have made it clear that Traore is done at Molineux unless there’s a surprise U-turn on a new contract and even then Wolves may feel he’s burned his bridges. Spurs were keen in January, but might have moved on now. Could get tricky, this. ",positive,norwich

An own goal from James Tarkowski had the Clarets 1-0 down at Vicarage Road on Saturday before late goals from Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill turned the game on its head. The comeback victory lifted them five points clear of the relegation zone before Everton beat Chelsea 1-0 on Sunday to close the gap back up to two points. Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature Michael Jackson has now won three matches in a row as caretaker manager after Burnley sacked Sean Dyche last month but Keane thought their celebrations gotunnecessarily out of hand. Keane said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football: “Big win obviously to come from a goal down, you see the reaction there. Obviously I don’t mind the manager celebrating but when I see everyone hugging and kissing I think it’s just slightly over the top.” Presenter Dave Jones interjected: “These are big results at stake aren’t they?” Keane continued: “I know, I know. But there has been all season. I think Dyche would’ve got the same results I really do but, listen, the decision is made now but there’s been a good reaction.” Jones then touched on Burnley’s good form and asked Jamie Carragher if that trend is continuing, to which the former Liverpool defender replied: “Yeah, I mean, I think Roy is right, we said that last week. Sometimes a different voice, maybe a slight change, you think of the impact it has maybe had on Dwight McNeil. “He did a great job, Sean Dyche, but it’s something a little bit different. If you just look at the numbers, and of course we’re only talking about four games, so that can be skewed because that’s such a great start. “But when you see the points and the goals, there’s obviously a huge uplift there because they’ve had such a great start. But I think the thing you look at when you go down is goals conceded as well and that’s something you always looked at with Sean Dyche’s team. “I see everyone hugging and kissing – I think it’s slightly over the top” 😤 Roy Keane was NOT happy with these Burnley celebrations ❌ pic.twitter.com/dH1Zhksa7E — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 2, 2022 “But, as I said, it’s only four games. The possession is slightly up. Percentage of passes long, a slight difference, we saw that in the goal last week when we went through the goals, you know, playing through the lines a bit more. “And the 10 plus pass sequences is a real big jump. So it looks like the manager is trying to put his own stamp on it. He’s going to try and keep the good things of Sean Dyche, keeping it right, but they’re playing a bit more football. “So they’ve almost changed slightly to play a bit more football, shall we say…”  ",positive,norwich

The pressure at the bottom of the table has shifted on to 18th-placed Everton and Leeds, who dropped to 17th following Burnley’s win. How Liverpool winning the Quadruple would help ‘banter club’ Man Utd move forward An own goal from James Tarkowski handed the home side the lead, and the visitors can consider themselves unlucky with the manner of the goal, as Juraj Kucka’s strike rebounded off the crossbar and into the net off the back of the Burnley defender. Burnley left it late to find a leveller, with Jack Cork heading in an 83rd-minute equaliser before Josh Brownhill’s strike sealed the comeback victory for the visitors. The Hornets had started the game second from bottom and nine points behind their opponents with five games remaining, however they now require wins in all their remaining matches this season as well as a big goal-difference swing to remain in the top flight. Burnley’s turnaround after parting company with Sean Dyche continued, with the Clarets taking 10 points from four games since Mike Jackson took over at Turf Moor. Watford opened the scoring with an eighth-minute own goal from Tarkowski. Joao Pedro had an opportunity to double his side’s lead in the 14th minute when he cleverly controlled a long ball from goalkeeper Ben Foster, taking the ball away from the defender, before firing over the bar. 🤩 𝗩𝗜𝗖𝗧𝗢𝗥𝗬 𝗔𝗧 𝗩𝗜𝗖𝗔𝗥𝗔𝗚𝗘 𝗥𝗢𝗔𝗗!!!#WATBUR | #UTC pic.twitter.com/8vz2vy6TBI — Burnley FC (@BurnleyOfficial) April 30, 2022 Burnley looked to hit back, with their first significant chance of the game, but Brownhill’s strike from distance skidded wide of the target. The visitors looked to have been given a way back into the game when referee Craig Pawson pointed at the penalty spot, but it was correctly overturned by VAR and a free-kick awarded instead. Burnley looked to get on the front foot at the start of the second half, with Nathan Collins attempting to lift the ball goalwards, only for Foster to make a straightforward save. However, Ismaila Sarr drove forward to create an opportunity, and the ball fell to Kucka, but his well-hit strike was saved by an outstretched Nick Pope. Burnley had a good chance in the 74th minute when Ashley Barnes’ header was tipped onto the crossbar by Foster who then managed to scramble the ball away. Foster had to make another save less than four minutes later with Burnley continuing to push for the equaliser. Burnley had been pushing throughout the second half for an equaliser, which came in the 83rd minute, as Cork timed his run well to head home from a ball from Charlie Taylor down the left. Less than three minutes later the Clarets had taken the lead, with Watford struggling to contain the visitors. The hosts were unable to clear their lines before the ball fell to Brownhill who fired it into the bottom corner, before sprinting the length of the pitch to celebrate with the travelling support.

https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-premier-league-winners-losers-everton-zaha-arteta-norwich-marsch,"Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature","Everton will do well to remember that ritual again this season. Wilfried Zaha gets praise but Norwich, Watford and Jesse Marsch do not. Winners Everton Any Everton supporter with a proclivity for ritualisation might find these last few weeks of the season particularly taxing. It is basic human nature to superstitiously recreate certain behaviours and practices – wearing a supposedly ‘lucky’ item of clothing or following a specific morning routine – in the hope of capturing that same positive energy. Fans might not be able to control what the players do, but if setting off early morning fireworks outside the opposition hotel, carrying an incredibly tranquil dog aloft through a raucous crowd, noisily welcoming the team bus, playing a game of catch with Richarlison and a flare and hiding the match ball up your jumper during stoppage time preceded a crucial victory over the reigning world and European champions, it might be worth trying again for the last five fixtures. Everton will be petrified of changing anything, considering how long it has taken to stumble upon a formula that works. After three wins and a draw in their opening four games, the longest unbeaten run the Toffees have been on in the Premier League this season is two matches. That surely has to change at some point before the end of the campaign for them to survive. But after watching that gap to safety extend to five points before kick-off on Sunday, Everton finally produced under pressure against Chelsea. It was a dogged, determined performance typified by Jordan Pickford’s brilliance, Yerry Mina’s snide and the industry of Demarai Gray and Richarlison, who combined for the winner. The only negative is that Frank Lampard’s side have two fixtures remaining at Goodison Park in comparison to three more trips away. Stock up on sparklers, prepare the calm canines and wear the baggiest clothes possible for that four-day period in which Brentford and Crystal Palace visit Merseyside, because Everton are 10th in a home table – and bottom, at least three points behind every other team in an away one – for a reason. Everton substance over style earns Lampard huge Chelsea scalp in relegation dogfight  BurnleyWhile there were 5,787 days between the amassing of Michael Jackson’s seven UK number ones, the accrual of ten Premier League points has taken Mike Jackson barely a fortnight. Burnley have won three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since April 2019. That same sequence of results – 2-0 against Wolves, 1-3 at Bournemouth and 2-0 against Cardiff – just so happens to contain the previous instance of the Clarets coming from behind to win away in the league. An Ashley Barnes own goal gifted Eddie Howe’s Cherries a fourth-minute lead but the striker rounded off the scoring early in the second half to complete a fine recovery. Three years later, James Tarkowski handed Watford the advantage after eight minutes by accidentally rebounding a shot into his own net. Barnes was central to their revival again, an inspired substitute for Wout Weghorst with half an hour remaining. It changed the angle and method of attack and Watford could not sustain the pressure. This unorthodox caretaker reign has reignited a fading survival bid but also reinvigorated a squad which looked quietly fractured and bereft. The Clarets have scored six goals in four games since Sean Dyche’s departure, each from different players in Wout Weghorst, Connor Roberts, Nathan Collins, Matej Vydra and now the unlikeliest double act of Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill. That the result effectively relegated Watford, barring a miracle, could have a further uplifting effect on one of the most tightly-knit squads around; seeing the pain of the drop first-hand sharpens the collective focus to avoid it. Burnley are finally on course to do just that. Michael Jackson has only been in charge of Burnley since 15 April and already has more Premier League points (10) than any Watford manager has taken this season (Munoz 7, Ranieri 6, Hodgson 9). — Richard Jolly 🇺🇦 (@RichJolly) May 1, 2022   Wilfried Zaha and Patrick VieiraThe situation could hardly have been managed any better. Patrick Vieira noted that Leeds wanted to have their cake and eat it, targeting Wilfried Zaha and fouling him four times before Kalvin Phillips tarred the Crystal Palace forward with a familiar brush.“For someone who dives so much, he has an awful lot of bruises on his ankles,” his manager said, explaining why Zaha started on the bench against Southampton. There was a time when that would have been an automatic signal of defeat for Palace. Zaha was their talisman, without whom they had little hope of operating functionally. He remains integral but this is a solid side that is adorned by his brilliance, rather than solely reliant upon it. Four minutes after Eberechi Eze’s equaliser against Southampton, Vieira threw Zaha on for the final half an hour with the express intention of occupying the home defence as a centre-forward – “We put him in the No.9 because of his mobility and the fact he can hold the ball and run in-behind” – and the results were resounding. Southampton are Zaha’s most frequent opponent. He has faced them 20 times. But his last few visits to St Mary’s had ranged from forgettable to a frustrating exhibition of his main weakness. The 29-year-old constantly toes the line and while he crossed the wrong side in rising to the provocation of James Ward-Prowse and being sent off in February 2019, Zaha somehow resisted the temptation to celebrate in the Southampton midfielder’s face upon his sublime stoppage-time winner. This is already the highest-scoring season of his career and it is no coincidence that he no longer feels the burden of constantly having to drag Palace up to his level. Vieira has built a team worthy of their crown jewel.  Jurgen KloppFive changes from midweek delivered a fifth 1-0 win of the Premier League season for Liverpool. The nature of those victories sum up Jurgen Klopp’s impeccable squad management, with each delivered by a different scorer: Naby Keita against Newcastle; Sadio Mane against West Ham in March; Fabinho against Burnley in February; Mo Salah against Aston Villa in December; and Divock Origi against Wolves the prior week. Extend it to all competitions and a sixth 1-0 win came from Diogo Jota’s effort against Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup quarter-finals. It is an enduring testament to both their strength in depth and of character.  RodriOne of the key fulcrums behind Manchester City’s unexpected set-piece dominance has been Rodri. They look far tighter defending free-kicks and corners with the midfielder in place, and much more threatening attacking them with him lurking. Perhaps behind only Ederson, it feels like Rodri is the player Pep Guardiola staked his reputation on the most. For a holding midfielder, his defensive instincts were initially poor and that counter-pressing role often proved beyond his capabilities and speed. There were few more polarising Manchester City players at one point: some saw enough to suggest he could eventually provide the necessary foundation for success, while others feared that dominance of the English game might always be just out of Rodri’s reach. He epitomises Guardiola’s reign in that way, by rising above preconceptions and changing the game to his whim instead of the other way around. His teammates have stood out at certain points, but Rodri has been a model of consistency.  Brighton’s scoutsMarc Cucurella was outstanding. Yves Bissouma was excellent. Moises Caicedo looks like an absolute Premier League natural. Enock Mwepu’s versatility has been a welcome addition to his game. Leandro Trossard has that air of a player who could raise his levels to suit the standard of most teams. Robert Sanchez matched his tally of clean sheets from last season. Those six players were signed for combined fees equivalent to the sales of Benjamin White, Anthony Knockaert and Aaron Mooy over the last two years. It is a neat party trick to master, particularly as it does not rely upon a specific manager, although the influence of an excellent coach undeniably helps the process. “We sold Ben and we’ve managed to improve. That’s the challenge in the Premier League for teams like us.It’s impossible to think you can keep hold of everybody. But we can sell at the right time, at the right price, then carry on trying to improve,” was Graham Potter’s message after the win over Wolves. Acknowledging that role in football’s food chain is important; embracing it is crucial. Marc Cucurella is unbelievably good every time I watch Brighton. So technically proficient on the ball, rounded defensive game, and can run the whole flank for the full 90 — Aaron Moniz (@amonizfootball) April 30, 2022   Cristian RomeroPatson Daka was theamuse-bouche that only intensified Cristian Romero’s appetite for his main course of Turkish affright. The halfway second challenge that directly preceded Heung-min Son’s first goal did not resemble a halfway line clash between hardened centre-halves, only because Caglar Soyuncu was entirely consumed by his counterpart. It was a comprehensive clattering. Tottenham would rise to fourth only temporarily, but even if they do eventually miss out on the Champions League there is solace in Romero’s presence. “The difficulty is, what top players are going to go to Spurs?” Roy Keane asked in January, suggesting that qualification for Europe’s premier competition was a prerequisite for attracting the best talent. Romero disproves that  Mikel ArtetaArsenal are another step closer to the ultimate justification. By the close of the January transfer window, Rob Holding had started four Premier League games and Mo Elneny just one. Eddie Nketiah’s only appearances outside of the League Cup by then had lasted no more than 19 minutes off the bench. Yet Mikel Arteta trusted all three to deliver when the inescapable time came that he had to call upon them. The Spaniard will be mocked and criticised by many onlookers but harnessing that sort of squad harmony is a delicate balancing act that only the two coaches competing for the title have managed better. The excellence of youth has underpinned this Arsenal season – Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli assisting the goals was apropos – but this is far more of a team effort than it ever has been a case of individualism.   Losers NorwichThere are deeper reads to be had on Norwich’s demise, but describing it as inevitable is misleading. In this particular season they had every chance of avoiding relegation, armed with a solid budget and the painful lessons of previous failures, with hindsight showing that other clubs could have been pulled further into danger. They should have had every advantage on Brentford, for example, yet 19 points separate the reigning second-tier champions from last season’s play-off winners. The sale of Emiliano Buendia was both predictable and early, yet the Canaries used neither the windfall nor the time nearly well enough. Most importantly, there was once an understanding and acceptance from the supporters, who long put their faith in the project and were sold The Norwich Way as the only way. That self-funded model has felt like a pre-prepared excuse all season. Other clubs have navigated those financial constraints much more convincingly. And unless the culture indelibly changes, even promotion next campaign will come with an undercurrent of trepidation from three successive top-flight relegations. Stuart Webber and his time have a few mountains to climb, not least in terms of getting supporters back onside.  Watford The feeling at Vicarage Road will be similar, albeit their fate has not been officially confirmed and the route by which it will surely be reached is vastly different. There have at least been suggestions that Watford intend on changing their ways by arming a younger manager with time and patience instead of whittling down the never-ending list of names on the combined Pozzo-Duxbury contacts book. But the jury will not expect to reconvene on that anytime soon. The next challenge will be to retain certain portions of the squad, because for all their flaws this is not a team which should be setting records for consecutive top-flight home defeats. Ismaila Sarr, Joao Pedro and Emmanuel Dennis are among those who have been gradually dragged down by an atrocious defence, despite the opposite being true last season when Xisco Munoz built upon a solid backline to gain promotion. There should be more optimism at Watford than Norwich, even if the Roy Hodgson appointment has been an unmitigated disaster for all involved. But Duxbury in particular will have questions to answer, considering he spent last May painstakingly listing all the mistakes the Hornets had learned from ahead of this season. Same again. Imagine being a #WatfordFC sub today and your manager not believing in you enough to bring you on. I hope for Duxbury’s sake the club aren’t relying on any of those subs for next year. — Rob Ezekiel (@Rob_Ezekiel) April 30, 2022   Jesse MarschIt was notable that Frank Lampard and Jesse Marsch echoed similar lines. The former described Everton’s fans as “the 12th man” and thanked them for helping “get us over the line late in the game”. The latter said that “the best part was the fans’ response” and “there was so much passion and love for the team from the fans”. The Leeds manager did stress that “that isn’t pandering to our fans” but it is a tough balance to strike. He and Lampard have both perhaps visited that well a little too often. But the key difference there is that Everton fans – rightly or wrong – welcomed their boss as the replacement for an unpopular figurehead, while Marsch started at a natural disadvantage due to the nature of Marcelo Bielsa’s relationship with the support. Few could blame him for leaning on that aspect of a 4-0 defeat in which Leeds had their chances. And in truth, they are losers mainly because of the worst possible results elsewhere. That five-game unbeaten run immediately before the Manchester City loss is keeping heads barely above water and a run-in of Arsenal, Chelsea, Brighton and Brentford has its pros and cons. Pandering or otherwise, Marsch and his players will need the fans to be in full voice.  ChelseaJose Mourinho, in combination with Steven Gerrard, successfully tricked the world into forgetting Chelsea led the Premier League table as late as April 2014; it was not only Liverpool who capitulated in that title race. On a far lesser scale, Thomas Tuchel might be accompanying his players on a slow slide down this table. The German ought to be thankful that the league season is both over soon, and will require Arsenal to face Tottenham in its penultimate week. Chelsea sit three points ahead of Arsenal and five above Spurs, all having played the same number of games. But only two of those sides have momentum currently in their favour. The Blues are finding it difficult to generate that and after a run of five consecutive Premier League wins, their form has been: L, W, L, W, D, L. Tuchel increasingly looks incapable of rousing them from this slump and preventing the individual mistakes that continue to undermine any hint of progress. The season could yet end with Wembley glory and Tuchel’s strength at Stamford Bridge thus far has been in managing those one-off games. But his reign will ultimately be measured by Premier League progress and that is a nut he still seems unable to crack.  WolvesThat unavoidable sense of flux has returned. Bruno Lage has completed a hat-trick of three successive Premier League defeats. Wolves emerged from that stuttering August start to establish their Champions League credentials, which were firmly ended by losses to Arsenal, West Ham and Crystal Palace in March. That cushion to 9th and below should be substantial enough to prevent goalless setbacks against Newcastle, Burnley and Brighton doing lasting damage, but it is demoralising for a season that promised so much to deliver so little.  The European semi-finalistsConsidering how delicately those Europa League and Europa Conference League semi-finals are poised, West Ham and Leicester’s respective seasons hang in the balance. Both are without a win in their last four Premier League games, starting from the match after their quarter-final second-leg heroics and bleeding into the final matches of their semi-finals. If either progress then that drop-off will be forgotten but it will be difficult to gather anything tangible from the season if they are knocked out in midweek.  SouthamptonA ludicrous football club. Between December 15 and February 25, Southampton went on a run of one defeat in 10 Premier League games. From March 5 to April 30, that has become a sequence of one win in nine. ",positive,norwich

They are a bit of a farce; you almost expect it from them. The players are taking Ralf Rangnick down with them. They are bad. “When I look at Manchester City and Liverpool, they have humble football players; no over-inflated egos, they understand their position, the team comes first. “There isn’t one Manchester United player that would get into any of those two teams, so why would you have an over-inflated ego, think you didn’t have to work hard, or be spiritless?

The 29-year-old is yet to renew his contract with the Reds but his agent is currently negotiating with the club to have him stay at Anfield, with a big-money four-year deal rumoured to be on offer. Sobhi has revealed he personally told Salah, whose deal at the club is set to expire in 2023, to leave Liverpool after Egypt’s defeat to Senegal in their 2022 World Cup play-off. “I met with Mohamed Salah at the airport after the end of the Senegal match and the failure to reach the World Cup finals and said to him to forget what happened and focus on what’s next,” Sobhi told Egyptian radio on Monday as quoted by The Metro. “I have advised him to continue his journey at a club other than Liverpool, but his direction now is to renew his contract with Liverpool. ""There are campaigns against Salah directed by some to bring him down, but I asked him not to pay attention to them.” Ahead of Liverpool's Champions League away clash against Benfica on Tuesday, manager Jurgen Klopp said Salah’s representatives are currently locked in negotiations with the club regarding his contract. “I am happy because there is nothing new to say, it is good. The decisive parties are talking to each other and that is all I need,” Klopp told reporters. On Salah’s form, which has seen him not score from open play since the  3-1 win over relegation-threatened Norwich City, Klopp said: “He [Salah] might not have scored in open play, I don’t know that is not important, for me his performance level is important, how he brings players together, when he gets the ball two or three players come to him, he could make better decisions but it is a tough gig, Africa for him and Sadio [Mane], but it is completely normal in a season. “We see him every day in training and it is nothing to worry about. These players will not come to me and ask for a break so I have to pick the moment.” While Salah has so far in this season managed 20 Premier League goals from 28 appearances, he has also notched eight goals in the Champions League campaign.

The Swedish starlet teed up a five-time Ballon d’Or for the first of his three goals against the Canaries at Old Trafford, with an all-time great netting a timely hat-trick in a Premier League fixture that the Red Devils had to win. Elanga joined in with an iconic celebration against the Canaries, with Ronaldo happy to share the limelight as part of a double act rather than have it all to himself – a situation he has grown accustomed to down the years. Elanga has told United’s official website of fluffing his lines somewhat when trying to emulate a talismanic team-mate: “That was an exciting time, the double SIUUU! “I didn't expect it. He said: 'Let's do it'. I said: 'Fair enough' but, if you see in the video, I didn't really get into the air properly! But I managed to do it anyway and it was a special moment. “He is someone I look up to and speak to and ask for advice and stuff. He is a special player to work with.” The 20-year-old forward added on earning the trust of Ronaldo after providing him with another assist: “We spoke about it the day before actually. How we were going to work in terms of pressing. “If you get an opportunity, to look up. If he gets an opportunity, to look up for me, as I'll be in the box or he will be in the box.” Anthony Elanga got the last word 🤫 pic.twitter.com/FV1zfF4RAk Elanga is enjoying a breakthrough campaign in 2021-22, with 24 appearances taken in across all competitions. He has recorded three goals, having made his senior bow last season, and is looking to make the most of an opportunity to work alongside Ronaldo on a daily basis “You can see his record and the amount of goals he's scored. I think it's 100 in the Premier League,” Elanga said of partnering a record-breaking colleague in United’s attack. “He knows what it takes to get to the top so it's more than right to just speak to someone like that. And, yeah, we have a chat the day before or even during a game. You might see us in the warm-up. “He'll speak to me and [Jadon] Sancho together about what we can do in the game, to affect the games, and it's important to have someone like that in the team.” United will be back in Premier League action on Monday when playing host to Brentford.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/explained-how-chelsea-affected-abramovich-sanctions/bltde22a5b972876413,Explained: How Chelsea are affected by Abramovich sanctions,"Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the United Kingdom Government, which will freeze his overseas assets, including Chelsea Football Club. On March 10, it was announced that Chelsea owner Abramovich, alongside six other high net-worth Russians, would be issued with an asset freeze and travel ban. Chelsea are now in an unprecedented period of uncertainty as the running of the club becomes directly linked to geopolitics. Chelsea can still be sold provided the sale does not benefit Abramovich or the Russian Federation, and the club are in discussions with the government about next steps. A statement from the UK government reads: ""While the current licence does not permit the sale of the club at this time, the Government is open to a sale of the club and would consider an application for a new licence to allow for a sale. ""Proceeds from any sale could not go to the sanctioned individual while he is subject to sanctions."" At least 20 buyers had been previously ready to purchase Chelsea. Chelsea can continue to play matches under a special 'Russia Regulations' licence which also allows their 1,400 staff - including players - to be paid. The upcoming Thursday evening kick-off against Norwich in the Premier League will go ahead, but only season ticket holders will be allowed to attend home games with further ticket sales barred. The Blues are not allowed to sign any new players due to the terms of their licence. It effectively places another transfer ban on the European and world champions, with the club having already endured one just three years ago. Although Chelsea are banned from making transfers, they can move money in and out of other clubs for outstanding payments related to deals done before the sanctions were imposed on March 10. Read more about how it will affect Chelsea's transfer plans Chelsea cannot continue their efforts to renew the contracts of their players, with expiring deals like Antonio Rudiger, Cesar Azpilicueta and Andreas Christensen having been previously high on their agenda. Their deals run out in the summer, as do the contracts of several talented youth players, including Xavier Simons. It could force the club to hold onto all players currently under contract, due to their inability to bring players in, should the issue not be resolved in the near future. Chelsea's main shirt sponsor, 3, is known to be reviewing its deal with Chelsea. “Sanctions placed on Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich by the UK Government casts a shadow over Chelsea’s many commercial agreements, including its $52.5 million (£40m) front-of-shirt deal with Telecom’s brand 3, and its $72m (£55m) kit deal with Nike,” says Conrad Wiacek, Head of Sport Analysis at GloblalData, a leading data and analytics company. “While Chelsea has a sporting licence to continue trading as a soccer club, many brands will be wary of guilt by association. “Chelsea FC is still one of the biggest clubs in the world and its on-field success still makes it an attractive commercial partner. However, given the rate at which many brands are looking to dissociate themselves from the Russian state, some may be wary of continuing partnerships. “Nike’s deal with Chelsea runs until 2032, so the apparel brand may decide to wait the situation out until the club’s sale is able to continue. However, brands such as Hyundai and Hublot, which have deals worth over $20m (£15m) combined expiring at the end of 2021-22 season, may not have that luxury.” Chelsea will be allowed to spend some money on staging matches at Stamford Bridge and in travelling to away matches. A spending limit of just £20,000, however, applies to travel to away games, and could cause issues with preparations for Champions League fixtures in particular. The club will also  have to prove that such costs are 'reasonable costs'. Chelsea are also barred from receiving any revenue from merchandising sales, but will be allowed to take revenue from broadcasting matches. Abramovich is said to be worth £9 billion ($12bn) and valued Chelsea at £3bn ($4bn) during his negotiations to sell the club. It is currently unclear if or when the sanctions will be lifted. It relates directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin's activity and the invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions will be reviewed in May, but there are further risks of a nine-point deduction should Chelsea go into administration. In the statement released by the UK Government, it describes Abramovich as a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch who has been involved in destabilising Ukraine."" He is further described as having a ""close relationship with Putin"" and providing steel for tanks in Russia's offensive. Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated in his government's release: ""There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin’s vicious assault on Ukraine. ""Today’s sanctions are the latest step in the UK’s unwavering support for the Ukrainian people. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies."" Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/12599944/where-could-each-premier-league-team-finish,Premier League clubs' best and worst possible final positions in table,"Manchester City and Liverpool are locked in a two-horse race for the Premier League title - but how high or low could your club finish this season? Clubs have between two and five games left to seal their fate but 19 out of 20 clubs are still challenging for the title, qualification for the Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League, or to avoid the drop. Data guru Ben Mayhew has calculated each club's range of possible final league positions and found only Norwich have nothing to play for besides pride during the remainder of this season. Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United are all in the hunt to join title-tussling Manchester City and Liverpool in the top four - with Spurs and United potentially slipping as low as eighth to miss out on Europe next season altogether. With seventh spot being the lowest position to potentially offer a European berth, if permutations play out across competitions, it means all teams from fifth to 13th-placed Aston Villa retain the potential to qualify for Europe. Norwich were relegated on Saturday after a 2-0 defeat to Villa and results conspired against them elsewhere, but, theoretically, every single team sitting above the Canaries up to ninth-placed Brighton could finish in the drop zone. Watford have been widely written off in the survival race but the Hornets could still finish in 16th, while the attention for that final relegation spot centres on Everton, Leeds and Burnley - but all three could still secure a top-half finish. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Premier League fixtures Mayhew has also simulated every possible result from the remaining games and calculated the probabilities of each club's possible final positions. The results suggest Manchester City have a 69-per-cent chance of retaining their Premier League crown, while Liverpool have almost the same chance of finishing as runners-up. Chelsea are nailed down for third spot at 93 per cent, with Arsenal pipping Tottenham to the final Champions League berth at 74 per cent - while Manchester United have a whopping 94-per-cent-chance of finishing in their current sixth spot. Each club’s attacking and defensive strength have been rated using an expected goals model, which measures the quality of chances they create and allow.  These ratings were then used to simulate the rest of the season 10,000 times to measure the probability of each club finishing in each league position. Further down the table - between Brighton and Southampton - things become far less predictable, with fairly even spreads between ninth and 15th. The probabilities consign Watford to the Championship but the pressure ramps up for the final drop spot, with Leeds favourites to finish in 18th (46 per cent), followed by Everton (31 per cent) and Burnley (23 per cent).

Ronaldo moved level with Heung-min Son in joint second in the Premier League goalscoring charts with his 17th of the season on Thursday, earning United a 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Thursday evening with what was his fifth strike in his last three games for the club. The 37-year-old has scored eight of United's last nine goals, including match-winning hat-tricks against Tottenham and Norwich, in an emphatic response to criticism that came his way earlier in the season during a run of one goal in 10 games. Neville and Keane both highlighted Ronaldo's ill fit for Ten Hag's high-pressing style, but said the five-time Ballon D'Or winner's sheer quality meant he should have a chance to see out the second of his two-year contract at Old Trafford. Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, Neville said: ""He lifts the fans, he gets them on the edge of their seats, takes his chances, and it'll be really interesting to see what happens with Erik Ten Hag. ""We knows he plays with an aggressive press, he tries to win the ball high up the pitch, that isn't Cristiano's strong point and we know that. But he will want a goalscorer. He will want someone who can put the ball in the back of the net 20 or 25 times.

You can't speak highly enough of him, his goal tonight was wonderful and he doesn't really lose that belief in himself when the rest of the team is really lacking in confidence - his is still there. ""He's a sensation, an absolute sensation. I talked about the attitude of the players in the first half and I wasn't really talking about him, he's proven over a long period of time and what he's doing, the shape of his body and the recovery from the tragedy only last week to still perform, to get back on the bike and go when he could've easily said he was staying off for a few weeks. In a poor season for United he's been a bright light in some ways."" Keane highlighted Ronaldo's mastery of ""the hardest part of the game"" - scoring goals: he has scored 20 times in 12 consecutive league seasons, with the possibility to make that 13 in the final three matches of this campaign. And the former United captain said the bit-part defensive role some former strikers, including Eric Cantona and Ruud Van Nistelrooy, had played during his time at the club shows how Ten Hag could build a pressing team around Ronaldo during his first season at the helm. Keane told Sky Sports: ""I know people are quick to criticise what [Ronaldo] doesn't do, in terms of his pressing, but he was never great at that anyway. He's the greatest at the hardest part of the game - putting the ball in the back of the net. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""That was his only chance tonight. Look at the chances Chelsea were creating; imagine if he'd been in the Chelsea team - he'd probably get 50 goals. ""Ten Hag will be having a sleepless night watching the team, but if you've got a player in the group who can score that amount of goals, they have to be involved. He'll want to play week-in, week-out, the new manager will come in and will be looking for another striker but Ronaldo's not hanging around unless he's playing. ""That's his biggest challenge, working with these personalities. As brilliant as they are, he has to get a team who can compete. And if that's winning the ball back high and pressing, Ronaldo is not good at that. But I still think you can have him in your team and have other players who can do that. ""Cantona, Van Nistelrooy wouldn't be great at chasing the ball back for you, but we had enough lads in the team who could win it. People say you need all your players to press, but you can get away with it with one player, and as long as they're producing the goods you'll forgive them.""

""Yes, right now we very much rely on Cristiano,"" he said at the press conference following the Chelsea draw. ""He also showed a good performance when Chelsea were in possession, he helped out a lot in the second half defensively.

Eight years after moving to David Moyes's Manchester United from Chelsea, the Spanish number eight appeared to wave goodbye in style. In United's 3-0 win over Brentford on Monday night, Mata rolled back the years to his early Premier League days - who knows if we'll see him in England's top flight again? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mata showed pace, precision and skill that defies his veteran years - linking up with Cristiano Ronaldo frequently in a commanding first-half display. The pair - with a combined age of 71 - showed intricate passing in tight spaces which forced Mata to shoot wide of David Raya's goal - before the duo linked up again for Ronaldo's goal that was ruled out by VAR for offside. Ralf Rangnick recognised how much better United played and perhaps Mata was the cause of that. United had 74 per cent possession of the ball in the first half, with a passing accuracy of 91 per cent. ""That is the reason why we were controlling the game,"" said the German. ""It had to do with the players on the pitch such as Juan, Bruno [Fernandes] and Nemanja Matic."" While players such as Matic have confirmed they will be leaving United this summer, Mata is yet to do so. Rangnick couldn't confirm what the Spaniard will do, but hailed the midfielder's skill and professionalism in equal measure. Premier League table Premier League results Watch Premier League highlights Get Sky Sports ""I don't know [what he will do], he hasn't confirmed that but it's possible [that he will leave]. It was an important night for players who have been here quite a long time. If it was their last game to say farewell like this. ""In the last couple of weeks, he showed how professional he is and how much he loves his game. You can feel and see how much he is a professional player. He almost played like a magician.""Sam Blitz This was Brentford's first defeat with Christian Eriksen in the starting line-up but the Dane was blameless for that at Old Trafford. He was their outstanding performer and one of the best players on the pitch throughout, showcasing that trademark distribution. ""He has been so good, Eriksen,"" said Gary Neville on co-commentary for Sky Sports, before wondering about the player's future in the summer. ""There will be clubs a lot higher up than Brentford looking at him. Manchester United need a new midfield…"" Whether that move will come to fruition is unclear but Eriksen will clearly have options. Despite this being a convincing victory for Manchester United - Brentford were well beaten - the playmaker still created more chances than any player on the home team. It is wonderful to see Eriksen performing at something close to his best. Having proven his fitness and at only 30 years old, there are not many squads that he would not improve. It will be intriguing to find out what he decides to do next. For now, just enjoy him.Adam Bate Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In a World Cup year, the credentials of most of England's regular talent are examined in detail, but none more so than the number one position. Based on Sunday's superhuman display, Gareth Southgate needn't look any further than Jordan Pickford in Qatar - his performance may even be good enough to convince the staunchest of doubters. On a day where Everton's survival bid depended on three points, their goalkeeper was a man mountain. In actual fact, Pickford may have registered not one but two submissions for 'save of the season' - denying both Cesar Azpilicueta and Antonio Rudiger with monumental stops in the second half. ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves,"" said Sky Sports' Graeme Souness. It's difficult to disagree. The Toffees approach to the game was aggressive and that worked to unsettle Chelsea, who were a shade below their level best. Regardless, no player epitomised the game plan more than Pickford, who was dogged and antagonistic from the off. The 28-year-old had to be at his acrobatic best to preserve an all-important clean sheet and coped impressively under some relentless pressure, with Lampard reaffirming why he is so highly thought of on Merseyside: ""Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top level goalkeeping."" In the two Premier League meetings between Everton and Chelsea this season, the England international has managed 14 saves, conceding just once. The result may well be the spark Everton require to pull off a remarkable escape with five games remaining. Needless to say, they will have to exhibit a similar amount of stubbornness in every fixture between now and the end of term if that bid is to be successful.Laura Hunter Everton captain Seamus Coleman: ""That save he came back off the line and parried out was world class, and we see that on a daily basis in training, and that is why he is England's number one - some of the saves were world class.""   Everton boss Frank Lampard: ""Jordan made great saves. They are Chelsea and will have chances, but we had chances as well. Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top-level goalkeeping, I am happy with him and all the players, and all the subs who came on.""   Sky Sports' Graeme Souness: ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves. Some of the saves he's not entitled to get anywhere near them.""   Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp: ""The one to deny Azpilicueta is the save of the season. It was magnificent. We've given Pickford a lot of stick in the past, but he was brilliant.""

On a day when Mikel Arteta's side were some way below their fluid best, their stand-in centre-back typified the grit that got them over the line. Holding, starting alongside Gabriel Magalhaes in the absence of the injured Ben White, ensured Arsenal did not miss a player who had started more Premier League minutes than any other this season. He took his goal superbly, rising between two West Ham defenders to flick Bukayo Saka's corner past Lukasz Fabianski, but it was at the other end of the pitch that he truly shone. Shortly before his goal, there was a stunning block to deny the unmarked Manuel Lanzini. It was one of three he made over the course of the 90 minutes - two more than any other player. Holding put his body on the line repeatedly and also made nearly twice as many clearances (seven) as any of his team-mates. He was brave but also smart, positioning himself intelligently to cut out passes and ensure West Ham's forwards rarely threatened. Arteta was delighted by his contribution and talked up his importance in the dressing room - even if he does not get as many opportunities as he would like on the pitch. ""To good people, good things happen,"" said the Arsenal manager in his press conference. ""He's a phenomenal person and when you ask him to come, he's always ready."" With four, nerve-shredding games remaining in a gruelling top-four race, Holding's grit is sure to be needed again. Nick Wright Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tottenham's season has reached a defining stage. The long-awaited north London derby comes after a trip to title-chasing Liverpool, a daunting double before season-ending fixtures against Burnley and already-relegated Norwich. Sunday's victory over Leicester ensured Spurs' destiny remains in their hands ahead of the run-in and provided yet more evidence that Antonio Conte's squad harbours the talent required to complete a task that looked so unlikely when the Italian was appointed. Only Mohamed Salah has more Premier League goals to his name this season than Heung-min Son after the South Korean took his tally to 19 for the campaign in style with Spurs' spectacular third against the Foxes. It came after Son's first-half corner had set up Harry Kane for Tottenham's opener, with the striker ending his five-game goal drought with a clinical stooping header. The rekindling of Kane's goalscoring touch was enhanced by the impact surprise omission Dejan Kulusevski had coming off the bench and setting up both of Son's goals. Spurs' front three are firing - at the perfect time. If Spurs are going to pip north London rivals Arsenal to Champions League football, their front three are going to be crucial. Ahead of a pivotal final four games of the season, the manner of the victory over Leicester should have instilled confidence they can get the job done.Jack Wilkinson Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  North London is chasing. That's what will be at the forefront of Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel's mind after conceding defeat to a team blighted by potential relegation concerns. Perhaps Chelsea legs were tired - a legitimate grievance given they played away at Manchester United three days ago - but their performance was reserved, almost standoffish. Chelsea were far too kind to a side whose desperation could have easily played into their own hands. Chances were spurned, despite a heroic display from Everton stopper Jordan Pickford - over half of Chelsea's attempted shots (11) were off target. And yet there was still no sign of Romelu Lukaku from the bench. Third spot is still the Blues to lose, but both Arsenal and Tottenham are closing in. Stamford Bridge will now be cautiously looking over its proverbial shoulder. Three of Chelsea's six Premier League losses this season have come in their last six games - so is form a problem ahead of an FA Cup final against high-flying Liverpool on May 14? Well, it's clear that a prerequisite of the Chelsea job is silverware - something that Tuchel has previously delivered. But this season threatens to crumble if Chelsea manage to slip out of the top-four race and allow favourites Liverpool to clinch the FA Cup. The latter is the likelier of scenarios, but Chelsea must remain alert. They face Wolves, Leeds, Leicester and Watford in the Premier League run-in; crucially, three of those fixtures are at home. The Blues must draw upon their Stamford Bridge dominance to see them through a tricky patch and ensure they supersede their London rivals in the hunt for a top three finish.Laura Hunter Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Leicester have conceded 14 goals from corners in the Premier League this season, the most of any side, and it once again led to their downfall at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The visitors had started promisingly, with Patson Daka striking the foot of a post from inside the Tottenham area. But against the run of play the hosts took the lead when Harry Kane headed in from a corner, completely unmarked, which spurred them on to a 3-1 victory. Rodgers made eight changes to his side, with their focus firmly on the Europa Conference League semi-finals, yet no matter who they have fielded during this campaign, defending corners has been a constant issue. ""Defending corners has been a problem for us all season - we lack aggression and cuteness. It was so disappointing,"" said Rodgers, whose side have surpassed the most conceded in a single season since Brighton's 16 in 2017-18. ""It is something we will have to look at in the summer through personnel.

Clubs have between two and five games left to seal their fate but 19 out of 20 clubs are still challenging for the title, qualification for the Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League, or to avoid the drop. Data guru Ben Mayhew has calculated each club's range of possible final league positions and found only Norwich have nothing to play for besides pride during the remainder of this season. Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United are all in the hunt to join title-tussling Manchester City and Liverpool in the top four - with Spurs and United potentially slipping as low as eighth to miss out on Europe next season altogether. With seventh spot being the lowest position to potentially offer a European berth, if permutations play out across competitions, it means all teams from fifth to 13th-placed Aston Villa retain the potential to qualify for Europe. Norwich were relegated on Saturday after a 2-0 defeat to Villa and results conspired against them elsewhere, but, theoretically, every single team sitting above the Canaries up to ninth-placed Brighton could finish in the drop zone.

On Monday night, the Cottagers thrashed Luton 7-0 at home to clinch the Championship title after they had made automatic promotion safe earlier this month with victory over Preston. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player After spending 13 consecutive seasons in the Premier League between 2001-2014, Fulham's fortunes have been somewhat less stable in recent years, with their last five campaigns ending in either promotion or relegation. No one can question Fulham's bounce-back ability. The pattern is consistent. Relegation woe is followed by the joy of immediate promotion. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  And once again it's only taken the London outfit one season of Championship football to realise their potential as a first-tier club, but questions over their longevity remain. Here we look at how Fulham can ditch their yo-yo past in favour of a sustained run as a genuine Premier League entity. Having won the Championship with a game to spare, Fulham boss Marco Silva will have one eye, or possibly even two, on next season. Fulham seal return to PL Championship table Get NOW TV - save more than 25% Live football on Sky Sports this week In Silva, Fulham have a leader with Premier League knowhow. In both top-flight forays of recent memory, they have been led by managers who lacked such experience. His Premier League win percentage (35.71) may be somewhat underwhelming, but counts for something given his predecessors - Slavisa Jokanovic and Scott Parker - started their respective top-flight campaigns on zero. Fulham have also led the Championship since mid-January and despite suffering a delay to their promotion parade with a few rogue results - notably against Coventry City and Derby County - have known their fate for weeks. Fulham have tried spending heavily with limited success in the past and will need to be shrewd operators in the summer transfer market to ensure they boost their squad in the areas they lack most. This time around, with automatic promotion secure without the need for the play-offs, Fulham are ahead of the competing pack. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  That security may pave the way for player trading earlier in the window and offer any newcomers more time to bed in. Fulham's recruitment policy has been flawed in recent years and relied too heavily at times on loanees. They splurged over £100m on 12 players ahead of 2018/19, before being forced into the January market for a short-term fix in an attempt to save their ill-fated season. A more considered plan of attack, which centres around two or three key targets in specific areas of weakness, as well as some pragmatic fine-tuning to the current squad will provide a better platform for success - this model has been well executed by both Leeds and Brentford over recent seasons. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Aleksandar Mitrovic is undoubtedly Fulham's talisman, although question marks remain over his Premier League suitability. Regardless, Silva appears to know how to get the best out of his record-breaking striker. He is thriving in a settled system guided by Silva's dynamic style. In March, Mitrovic broke Ivan Toney's Championship scoring record by notching his 32nd and 33rd league goals of the season in a win over Peterborough. In Monday night's win over Luton, the 27-year-old broke Guy Whittingham's second-tier record of 42 goals in a single 46-game campaign with his two second-half strikes taking him onto 43 for the season with a game to play. There is a very clear correlation between Mitrovic's bounty and Fulham's fortunes. In 2020/21, the striker scored more international goals for Serbia (7) than he did at club level (4), as Fulham were relegated having only found the net 27 times all season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It's clear that under Silva, Mitrovic has much more potency. He has got better at coming deep and linking play and is much more of a complete forward, registering a further seven assists. It's also no surprise that Fulham possess the league's most abundant provider in Harry Wilson - 19 assists. In order to dictate the outcome of games in the Premier League, Fulham need to figure out a formula that puts their prized asset, who was named Championship Player of the Season, at the centre of the action. Championship winners tend to fare better than play-off winners - although Norwich City remain an exception to that rule. Fulham must therefore harness the momentum gathered from such a successful season and put it to good use in the early part of the new term. Leeds, Wolves and Burnley are all examples of clubs who have won the Championship title in recent years and exhibited staying power in the top-flight by profiting from the promotion wave. This does not last forever - as demonstrated by Sheffield United's second season demise - but could serve to energise a positive start. The same impetus applies to individuals. There will be a void left by teenage sensation Fabio Carvalho - who is set to depart for Liverpool in the summer - but among Fulham's Premier League 2 (Division 2) title-winning youngsters there is a clear abundance of talent to supplement the quality within the first team. The carryover must also extend to Fulham's stellar strike force. If Mitrovic and Wilson can hit the same heights and deliver a comparable amount of firepower in the Premier League, it's entirely reasonable to forecast Fulham's stay in the top tier to extend beyond a single season. Plenty of ifs, buts and maybes, but there are certainly grounds for cautious optimism. Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6. Play for free, entries by 3pm ",positive,norwich

The 37-year-old once again played a key part at Old Trafford â a ground he has scored 13 goals at this season. And as he set himself to score to make it 2-0, teammate Anthony Elanga was in confident spirits. In fact, the academy product started making his way to the corner flag before Ronaldo had even hit the ball.

Very good movement, but poor defending,"" the former United captain told Sky Sports. âThatâs what you want from young players. You got to mix your game up, when to go short, when to spin.

""This is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag,"" Rangnick told Sky Sports when asked about the forward's future. ""Heâs showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but itâs obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, itâs pretty obvious.

Jordan then followed up with: ""I think Leeds are probably, with the way they've come into the Premier League and with the injuries they've had this season, I think they are the more deserving of those three to stay up."" Leeds sacked Marcelo Bielsa in February and hired Jesse Marsch, who did manage to go five games unbeaten. A draw to Crystal Palace on Monday and 4-0 hammering at the hands of Manchester City has seen them dragged back into it, with Burnley now the form team of the trio. The Clarets parted company with long-time boss Sean Dyche last month and placed caretaker Mike Jackson in charge. Since then they've taken ten points from 12 games and scored six goals.

Loadingâ¦ A miserable season at Old Trafford will come to end on Monday night, as United play their final home game, ahead of two away fixtures. Fans have only seen their team win nine times in the league in Manchester so far this season, which is actually an improvement on their away form, and the end of the campaign probably can't come soon enough. When the final whistle is blown following the game against Thomas Frank's team the players are set to take a lap of honour, or give a lap of appreciation to the fans, depending on how it's spun. A group of fans will miss the gesture however, as there is a planned walkout 17 minutes from the end of the match, to protest the 17 years the club has been under American ownership from the Glazer family. In recent games the 17 minutes of not being in their seats has come before kick off but the Brentford match protests are planned for the final part of the game. Whilst the club are aware that the players might not get the best reception during their lap, there are several players playing in front of the home fans for the last time. Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata's contracts are both expiring, so could play their last minutes at Old Trafford, whilst Paul Pogba and Edinson Cavani are in the same situation but injured. Nemanja Matic has also revealed that he wants to leave in the summer, and others are expected to depart with the arrival of Erik ten Hag likely to lead to a clearout. Some players may get a warm reception but Pogba, whose future isn't sorted yet, was recently booed when coming off in the game against Norwich City. Monday's game comes a year after the club's fans had their most 'successful' protest against the owners, as they managed to get a game with Liverpool postponed. Thousands gathered outside of Old Trafford, whilst games were still being played behind closed doors due to Covid, and hundreds even got onto the pitch. There were also protests outside of the hotels the two sets of players were gathered at, stopping the clubs getting to the match, and it was played at a later date. The time Premier League winners need to win their remaining three games, with matches against Brighton and Crystal Palace to follow, just to level their worst points tally since the inception of the league in 1992.

Rice still has more than two years left to run on his current deal at London Stadium, with the option of another year, but he has recently turned down the chance to pen an extension. Man United are believed to be keen on a summer move for the midfielder, while Chelsea continue to be linked with the player that they released from their academy at the age of 14. However, West Ham are thought to value Rice in the region of £150m, with the Hammers desperate to keep hold of him amid the growing speculation. © Reuters The Englishman has said that he has had ""two or three top seasons with West Ham"", but he is refusing to get ""carried away"" with the recent rumours surrounding a big-money exit. ""I feel like playing well comes with speculation. I've had two or three top seasons with West Ham and the top clubs around the country are always going to be watching. It's not just me, it's the same for every player,"" Rice told Sky Sports News. ""I think it's important not to get too carried away with that. We've had a good season with West Ham and there have been big games I've had to play in so I feel like my focus has always been on that. If I thought about other things, I'd get carried away and that wouldn't be fair on the team or the manager. ""I can't help speculation, even with the numbers that get talked about. I get battered for it all the time on social media, but I can't help that. I can help by going on the pitch and performing as best as I can. They [West Ham teammates] wind me up all the time. It's crazy to speak about to be honest, so I just kind of block it out and do what I do best and that's play football."" Rice, who is also now a vital player for England, has netted once and provided four assists in 33 Premier League appearances for David Moyes's side during the 2021-22 campaign. © Reuters The midfielder has also played a leading role in West Ham's run to the semi-finals of the Europa League, scoring three times in nine appearances, and the Hammers will head to Eintracht Frankfurt later this week for the second leg of their semi-final. Manchester City and Liverpool have also been credited with an interest in Rice, who has scored 10 times and registered nine assists in 191 appearances for Moyes's side in all competitions. West Ham could ultimately price the midfielder out of a summer exit, though, with Man United already believed to be looking at cheaper alternatives to the former Chelsea youngster. The Red Devils will sign at least one new central midfielder this summer, as both Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba are preparing to leave the club in search of pastures new. Sanctions placed on current Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich are preventing the club from acting in the transfer market at this moment in time, but the Blues are expected to soon have a new owner in place. West Ham will take on Norwich City, Man City and Brighton & Hove Albion in their final three Premier League games of the season, while Rice will be bidding to lead the Hammers to the Europa League final, but the capital outfit trail 2-1 from the first leg of their semi-final with Frankfurt.

Chelsea have led the way, spending more than £200million in recent months, but United's only capture, to the chagrin of their army of supporters, has been Dutch midfielder Donny Van De Beek from Ajax. Edinson Cavani is highly likely to bolster Manchester United's forward line (Andrew Milligan/PA) Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has once again had to bear the brunt of criticism with United so far unable to strike deals for forward pair Jadon Sancho and Ousmane Dembele from Borussia Dortmund and Barcelona respectively.  Dortmund's 120m euros (£108m) asking price for Sancho has been a key issue in recent months while sporting director Michael Zorc told reporters on Saturday that ""the door is closed"", which seems to bring an end to speculation.  United are highly likely to strengthen their forward line with the capture of veteran Uruguayan Edinson Cavani following his release by Paris St Germain, but other areas of concern for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer may go unaddressed.  They had been linked with Gareth Bale before he ultimately plumped for a return to Spurs, where Alli seems to be surplus to requirements having not played in the top flight since their season-opening defeat to Everton.  PSG have already had one offer rejected and have been tipped to make a follow-up loan bid for the 24-year-old, who has been left out of Gareth Southgate's England squad for the fixtures against Wales, Belgium and Denmark. Dele Alli was not included in England's latest squad for their three fixtures in October (Jonathan Brady/PA) Arsenal could raid Chelsea for the second time this summer. Having signed Willian on a free transfer, Gunners boss Mikel Arteta is out to boost his midfield options and Jorginho is reported to fit the bill.  Even though Frank Lampard has strengthened in the middle of the park by signing Hakim Ziyech and Kai Havertz – with Ben Chilwell, Edouard Mendy and Timo Werner also joining in big-money moves – the Blues head coach may be reluctant to let go of a player who has twice captained the side this season.  Manchester City's stuttering start to the campaign might see them make a late foray into the transfer market for a new left-back, with Bayern Munich's David Alaba and Ajax's Nicolas Tagliafico among those being apparently courted.  Champions Liverpool are rumoured to be eyeing a last-gasp swoop for Dembele but having added Diogo Jota, Thiago Alcantara and Kostas Tsimikas to their ranks, Jurgen Klopp is probably satisfied with his lot.  Merseyside rivals Everton are bracing themselves for bids for Moise Kean, allegedly attracting interest from PSG and former club Juventus, but his departure could pave the way for Arkadiusz Milik to join the Toffees from Napoli. Sean Dyche's Burnley are yet to record a point in the Premier League this season (Martin Rickett/PA) Leeds, who have made a whirlwind start in their first top-flight campaign in 16 years, are supposed to be closing in on Rennes winger Raphinha while Norwich's Todd Cantwell is also a priority for the Elland Road club.  Burnley, without a point from their opening four matches, have seen Jeff Hendrick, Aaron Lennon and Joe Hart all leave Turf Moor and their only outfield signing so far has been Dale Stephens from Brighton.

Spurs face a daunting trip to quadruple-chasing Liverpool on Saturday evening before Arsenal host Leeds, who have been dragged into the thick of a three-way relegation fight. With a two-point lead over their bitter rivals, fourth-placed Arsenal will be the more comfortable of the two, and this weekend offers them a good chance to open up a five-point gap on Spurs and potentially a cushion going into the north London derby at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Thursday week. But this is merely a scrap for fourth place, quite different to the relentless nature of the title race between Liverpool and Manchester City. Neither Arsenal nor Spurs have shown enough consistency this season to suggest they are certain to win their three other fixtures, so there should be more twists to come. If Spurs have an X-factor, it is their world-class individuals. In head coach Antonio Conte, they have one of the game’s best, while Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester was made comfortable by the brilliance of Harry Kane, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski at one end and Cristian Romero at the other. Arsenal, by contrast, are lacking the same star quality but feel like a more rounded team under Mikel Arteta, further along in their rebuild than their neighbours. Last month, Brighton and Brentford offered a blueprint of how to nullify Conte’s Spurs — specifically, deny them space in the final third and stop Kane getting on the ball — and, in having a more clearly-defined system, Arsenal are harder to stop and better at breaking down stubborn opponents. Arteta is also getting more from his squad than Conte, and important performances from fringe players Mohamed Elneny, Eddie Nketiah and Rob Holding in the wins over Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham point to a united group, with deceptive depth. By contrast, Lucas Moura was hopelessly rusty on his first Spurs start since mid-February on Sunday, while Harry Winks was off the pace in a late cameo, hardly surprisingly given Conte has barely changed his XI for over two months. Both clubs have been impacted by injuries in the same positions, with Spurs losing midfielder Oliver Skipp and wing-back Matt Doherty, and Arsenal without Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney in similar positions. Mikel Arteta vs Antonio Conte - who will win the race for Champions League qualification? The absences may prove crucial in the run-in. In Nuno Tavares, who is deputising for Tierney at left wing-back, Arsenal have an agent of chaos, and while the Portuguese is in the team there is a chance they will drop points in any game. Kulusevski, who came off the bench to twice assist Son on Sunday, should have the beating of Tavares if they both start on May 12. For all their star quality up front, Spurs, though, are weak on both flanks. In the absence of Doherty and Sergio Reguilon, who is sidelined indefinitely with a groin injury, wing-backs Emerson Royal and Ryan Sessegnon failed to make an impact in the final third against Leicester. But it is long past the point where Conte is likely to change his system or experiment on the flanks. If Arsenal allow Spurs’ wing-backs to have the ball, and keep it away from their forwards, they will be in a strong position next week. Spurs finish the season against Burnley, who are likely to be fighting for survival, and already-relegated Norwich, while Arsenal face a tough trip to Newcastle and host Everton on the final day, when the Toffees may also be playing for their Premier League status. The derby will surely be crucial, but the fight for Champions League football could come down to Spurs’ individual brilliance against Arsenal’s collective cohesion and unity. Whatever happens in the next fortnight, expect the contest to go the wire. ",positive,norwich

On Friday, Conte dismissed reports he had offered himself to Paris Saint-Germain as “fake news” and “lies”, and it was suggested to him at a later briefing that he could put an end to unwanted speculation over his future by committing to Spurs. But Conte reiterated that he was only focussed on the final five games of the season and would sit down with the club -- meaning chairman Daniel Levy and managing director Fabio Paratici -- to find “the best solution” after the visit to Norwich on May 22. The head coach effectively wants guarantees that Spurs can challenge at the top of the Premier League, saying he deserves “much more” than another scrap for fourth place next season, and suggested his future would depend on whether he has the patience to match the time needed to rebuild the squad. “As I said to [the media] a lot of times, at the end of the season we'll speak with the club but with pleasure, in a really good way,"" Conte said. “We'll speak and try to find the best solution for everybody. This has to be clear. “I repeat: don’t forget I like to have ambition, not only to fight for a place in Champions League or a place in the [Europa] League. Honestly, I want to fight for much more. For much more. I think also I deserve to do this. “It will be very important to understand how much time we need to fight for something important [and] if we have the patience to wait because for sure this is a process. “I always say to you that we need time and patience. And we have to understand how much time we need and how much patience we have. We have to understand this and to understand if we can match my opinion and the club's opinion. “I know very well that in England it is not simple [to win]. First of all, to fight for and to try to win the title is not simple. It’s important to understand also how much time we need if our ambition is to fight to win the title.” Spurs are two points behind fourth-place Arsenal ahead of Sunday's visit of Leicester but host the Gunners on May 12 in what could effectively be a play-off for Champions League football. Daniel Levy “If we are very good to [achieve] this target, it will be a great achievement for the club, for me. It would be important,” Conte added. “With our ambitions for the future, it would be very important, because I think that I deserve to try to fight for and to win trophies and to fight for something important, not for only sixth or seventh, eight place, or if you have a fantastic season, fourth place. Only this. “But I repeat this is my ambition and it is important to understand and fully match the ambition at the time that we need it.” Conte is under contract until the end of next season and the deal is understood to not include a break clause. Pushed on why he could not commit to Spurs, he added: “My answer is always the same and my answer is still the same, to have another answer is not useful for anyone. My opinion didn’t change, my thoughts didn’t change, my ambition didn’t change. I am the same. I have a fantastic relationship with all the people who work here, and with Daniel Levy and Fabio Paratici. “What I said in the past was the truth. We are trying do this season in the best possible way and then we will see.” Conte's comments will put more pressure on Levy to promise the back the Italian but the head coach insisted he is enjoying his role and working under the chairman and Paratici. “I repeat I am enjoying a lot to work here, I have a fantastic relationship with all the people who work here and with Daniel Levy our chairman and Fabio Paratici,” Conte said. “For this reason it is right to at the end to have a good meeting, a private meeting, and to try to find the best solution for everybody. “When you start to stay for a good period in a club and you understand the dynamics, you start to know much better the people that work with you, the environment “And for sure I always said that I am enjoying a lot to work in Tottenham, to stay in Tottenham, and to come to the training ground, to breath this atmosphere. I can speak only well about Tottenham, about the club. For a coach, a manager, it is a good opportunity and you can enjoy your work here.” ",positive,norwich

Spurs face a daunting trip to quadruple-chasing Liverpool on Saturday evening before Arsenal host Leeds, who have been dragged into the thick of a three-way relegation fight. With a two-point lead over their bitter rivals, fourth-placed Arsenal will be the more comfortable of the two, and this weekend offers them a good chance to open up a five-point gap on Spurs and potentially a cushion going into the north London derby at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Thursday week. But this is merely a scrap for fourth place, quite different to the relentless nature of the title race between Liverpool and Manchester City. Neither Arsenal nor Spurs have shown enough consistency this season to suggest they are certain to win their three other fixtures, so there should be more twists to come. If Spurs have an X-factor, it is their world-class individuals. In head coach Antonio Conte, they have one of the game’s best, while Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester was made comfortable by the brilliance of Harry Kane, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski at one end and Cristian Romero at the other. Arsenal, by contrast, are lacking the same star quality but feel like a more rounded team under Mikel Arteta, further along in their rebuild than their neighbours. Last month, Brighton and Brentford offered a blueprint of how to nullify Conte’s Spurs — specifically, deny them space in the final third and stop Kane getting on the ball — and, in having a more clearly-defined system, Arsenal are harder to stop and better at breaking down stubborn opponents. Arteta is also getting more from his squad than Conte, and important performances from fringe players Mohamed Elneny, Eddie Nketiah and Rob Holding in the wins over Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham point to a united group, with deceptive depth. By contrast, Lucas Moura was hopelessly rusty on his first Spurs start since mid-February on Sunday, while Harry Winks was off the pace in a late cameo, hardly surprisingly given Conte has barely changed his XI for over two months. Both clubs have been impacted by injuries in the same positions, with Spurs losing midfielder Oliver Skipp and wing-back Matt Doherty, and Arsenal without Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney in similar positions. Mikel Arteta vs Antonio Conte - who will win the race for Champions League qualification? The absences may prove crucial in the run-in. In Nuno Tavares, who is deputising for Tierney at left wing-back, Arsenal have an agent of chaos, and while the Portuguese is in the team there is a chance they will drop points in any game. Kulusevski, who came off the bench to twice assist Son on Sunday, should have the beating of Tavares if they both start on May 12. For all their star quality up front, Spurs, though, are weak on both flanks. In the absence of Doherty and Sergio Reguilon, who is sidelined indefinitely with a groin injury, wing-backs Emerson Royal and Ryan Sessegnon failed to make an impact in the final third against Leicester. But it is long past the point where Conte is likely to change his system or experiment on the flanks. If Arsenal allow Spurs’ wing-backs to have the ball, and keep it away from their forwards, they will be in a strong position next week. Spurs finish the season against Burnley, who are likely to be fighting for survival, and already-relegated Norwich, while Arsenal face a tough trip to Newcastle and host Everton on the final day, when the Toffees may also be playing for their Premier League status. The derby will surely be crucial, but the fight for Champions League football could come down to Spurs’ individual brilliance against Arsenal’s collective cohesion and unity. Whatever happens in the next fortnight, expect the contest to go the wire. ",positive,norwich

Back-to-back defeats - a first for the season - to Coventry and Derby have delayed the confirmation of a third Championship promotion in five years (a statistic which tells you all you need to know about how the other two went). But should Marco Silva’s side finish the job at home to Preston tonight, they will have three-and-a-half months to happily look forward to the start of their latest top-flight campaign and, more importantly, crack on with preparing for it. It is little surprise that so much stock is being put in that extended window of opportunity, since so many of the failings of Fulham’s last two tilts at the Premier League had roots in decisions taken (or not) during summers shortened by play-off campaigns and then botched by those in charge. In 2018, a splurge of well over £100million - from which the club are still feeling the FFP ramifications - and 12 new signings failed to produce a functioning team, Slavisa Jokanovic’s side all but doomed by the time he was sacked having taken just five points from their first 12 games. Two years later, there was a resolve to do things markedly differently, with an appreciable but perhaps naive emphasis on fewer and shrewder acquisitions and more faith placed in the players that had won promotion. The result was four successive defeats to start the campaign, a raft of panicked late-window additions and the writing again already on the wall. As David Lloyd, founder of Fulham fanzine TOOFIF, puts it: ""There were 21 or 24 points down the swanny before we even had a back four!"" That so many of those belated arrivals came in on loan meant the bulk of the side that won promotion two years ago was still around to be summoned back into action this season, a core of players including Tim Ream, Bobby Decordova-Reid, Aleksandar Mitrovic, Tom Cairney, Marek Rodak, Harrison Reed and Neeskens Kebano all making significant contributions once again. Several had been effectively shunned by Scott Parker in the Premier League, some allegedly personally as well as professionally, with Mitrovic the most obvious example - it was clear last summer that one or the other would have to go. Parker, still a hugely respected figure at the club and across the game, eventually stepped down and may well join his former employers in stepping straight back up with Bournemouth, but there is little regret at his departure given what Mitrovic has gone on to achieve in destroying the Championship goalscoring record with his 38 strikes and counting this term. Marco Silva has offered a new lease of life to players shunned by former boss Scott Parker The Serbian has epitomised a team improved no end for being handed a fresh slate and a new lease of life by Silva, the aforementioned nucleus supplemented by the likes of Antonee Robinson and Tosin Adarabioyo - defenders of fine potential thrown in at the deep end last season - as well as the outstanding young creative talents of Harry Wilson and the Liverpool-bound Fabio Carvalho. “You've only got to look at the smiles on the players' faces, even from the start of the season,” Lloyd says. “We hit the ground running and it's been goals galore, by and large."" There is little doubt that they represent the best of the three recent promotion-winning Fulham sides. With five games to go, they have already surpassed 2020’s points and wins hauls, scoring a staggering 95 goals (compared with 64 two years ago) and - perhaps best summing up their rampant, flowing football - finding the net at least four times in a quarter of their matches. Unsurprisingly, the question is already of how that will translate to the top division. Comparisons with Norwich, similarly expansive and expressive in winning the Championship last year, are inevitable, since the pair appear to be locked in some sort of perpetual division-trading phenomena. But looking across west London at the more pragmatic and resolute manner in which rivals Brentford have sacrificed some of their second-tier swagger and readily cruised to safety ought to provide the blueprint. Fulham should look to rivals Brentford as a blueprint for how to survive in the top-flight If that has to be the case then it is worth wondering whether the enthusiasm for promotion is retained by a fan base who have so recently created such wonderful memories in the Championship and such chastening ones in the league above. It is, Lloyd says, in part because “you've got to throw in the fact that we've had seasons where fans haven't been able to go” and if tonight is the night on which Fulham supporters can celebrate a deal sealed, it will be the first time they’ve been able to do so in person since a heady day at Wembley almost four years ago. There will still be four matches to play and a title to be clinched but attention will turn swiftly to the summer, when so many lessons must be learned and acted upon if a third yo-yo is to be left only half-complete.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-conte-levy-psg-b997258.html,Tottenham: Crunch talks with Daniel Levy still key to Antonio Conte’s future despite dismissing PSG rumours,"ntonio Conte has again refused to offer guarantees he will be at Tottenham next season, saying his future will only be decided after a meeting with the club at the end of the campaign. On Friday, Conte dismissed reports he had offered himself to Paris Saint-Germain as “fake news” and “lies”, and it was suggested to him at a later briefing that he could put an end to unwanted speculation over his future by committing to Spurs. But Conte reiterated that he was only focussed on the final five games of the season and would sit down with the club -- meaning chairman Daniel Levy and managing director Fabio Paratici -- to find “the best solution” after the visit to Norwich on May 22. The head coach effectively wants guarantees that Spurs can challenge at the top of the Premier League, saying he deserves “much more” than another scrap for fourth place next season, and suggested his future would depend on whether he has the patience to match the time needed to rebuild the squad. “As I said to [the media] a lot of times, at the end of the season we'll speak with the club but with pleasure, in a really good way,"" Conte said. “We'll speak and try to find the best solution for everybody. This has to be clear. “I repeat: don’t forget I like to have ambition, not only to fight for a place in Champions League or a place in the [Europa] League. Honestly, I want to fight for much more. For much more. I think also I deserve to do this. “It will be very important to understand how much time we need to fight for something important [and] if we have the patience to wait because for sure this is a process. “I always say to you that we need time and patience. And we have to understand how much time we need and how much patience we have. We have to understand this and to understand if we can match my opinion and the club's opinion. “I know very well that in England it is not simple [to win].

We are now into May, which means the business end of the year is fast approaching and the race for the Champions League spots is at fever pitch. With Manchester City and Liverpool well clear at the top, there are five more teams in contention for the final two Champions League places plus the Europa League spots, with some massive ties ahead. Most of the sides involved only have four games left, but Manchester United only have two. Here talkSPORT takes a look at the Premier League top-four battle as we approach the end of the campaign…   Chelsea have been in the top four the whole season, and are five points clear of fifth. However, their place in the top four isn’t secure yet and they are going to need a few more results from their last four league games. Thomas Tuchel’s side started the campaign as genuine title contenders, but four wins in 11 saw them drop well behind City and Liverpool. From there, it looked as if the Blues would comfortably seal third, but after defeats to Brentford, Arsenal and Everton, that doesn’t look to be guaranteed yet. Chelsea have had to deal with carnage away from the pitch this season, which would likely mean the Blues will have to cap their spending this summer. So, if they were to miss out on the Champions League, who knows what could happen to the club without that income? In their remaining games, Chelsea face Wolves and Leeds. If they manage to avoid defeat in these fixtures, they should do enough to secure their place in the top four. But a season that had so much promise looks like it will end in slight disappointment. Predicted finish – 3rd Wolves – H – May 8 Leeds – A – May 11 Leicester – H – May 19 Watford – H – May 22  Arsenal have turned it around after a nightmare start that saw them at the bottom of the table after three defeats. Since then, the Gunners have pushed on and they are right in the race for the top four. The North Londoners haven’t played in the Champions League since the 2016/17 campaign, and Mikel Arteta has put his faith in a lot of young and very talented footballers. This group of players have been brilliant for the Gunners, but they lost three games in a row recently against Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton. However, just when things could have turned sour, they managed to beat Chelsea, Man United and West Ham to move two points clear of Spurs. The Gunners still have some massive games to play against the likes of Tottenham and Everton, so Arsenal could yet miss out on a place in the top four. Predicted finish – 5th Leeds United – H – May 8 Tottenham – A – May 12 Newcastle – A – May 15 Everton – H – May 22  Tottenham have had a very odd season but they are still in the race for the Champions League. Spurs started the campaign with Nuno Espirito Santo in charge, but after winning his first three league games, things quickly went wrong and he was dismissed well before Christmas. Antonio Conte arrived as his replacement, and after a solid start in which Tottenham were unbeaten in the league for nine matches, they lost four of their next five, including a 1-0 defeat to Burnley. Things didn’t look great, but on transfer deadline day, Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur arrived from Juventus and have helped turn the season around. Spurs then scored 25 goals in seven league matches, winning six of those. However, they then lost to Brighton and only managed a 0-0 draw against Brentford, which halted their season. But they got back to winning ways on Sunday with a 3-1 victory over Leicester City, so they are back on track. If we look at their remaining fixtures, we can see they still have to play Liverpool and Arsenal. The North London derby against the Gunners could decide who lands that final Champions League spot, but Spurs should still have enough to finish fourth if they turn it on again. Predicted finish – 4th Liverpool – A – May 7 Arsenal – H – May 12 Burnley – H – May 15 Norwich – A – May 22  Man United have had a season to forget – they are out of all the cup competitions and look unlikely to get a place in the top four. The season started with so much optimism after the signings of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho. However, things quickly went wrong, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was dismissed early into the campaign. The Red Devils then brought Ralf Rangnick in until the end of the year as interim manager, but he has never performed that role before and has struggled to get a tune out of this squad. The German has only lost five of his 22 league games in charge but seven draws in that time have cost the Red Devils valuable points, and it looks increasingly likely they won’t finish in the top four. Man United still have to play Crystal Palace and a resurgent Brighton in their last two, but Arsenal and Tottenham have two games in hand on the Red Devils. Therefore, this campaign has the potential to end terribly for the world’s most famous club. Predicted finish – 7th Brighton – A – May 7 Crystal Palace – A – May 22  West Ham have not been outside of the top ten this season and have been as high as third on some occasions. It’s been highly impressive given that David Moyes has a small squad to work with and has one first-team striker in Michail Antonio. The Hammers are also deep into the Europa League, so the fact they have kept up with the likes of Arsenal and Tottenham is commendable, and they should finish in a Europa League spot no matter what. This season has seen the Irons beat the likes of Liverpool and Chelsea but the top four might just be out of their reach. However, given they are in the semi-finals of the Europa League, you would have to make them one of the favourites for that competition, so they could end up in the Champions League anyway. West Ham still have to play Manchester City, so they could still have a big impact on the title race.

At the end of the year, three teams will be relegated from the top flight and into the Championship. Norwich City’s demotion has already been confirmed, but who will join them? Assuming Southampton and Brentford are now safe, the fight to survive is down to four teams. Most sides have four games remaining this season but Everton have five, which could cause heartbreak for some. Here, talkSPORT looks at how the Premier League relegation picture is shaping up as we enter the final weeks of the campaign.   Burnley have been in the Premier League for six seasons and they now look capable of securing a seventh. The Clarets have won three league games in a row to move out of the drop zone and above Leeds United. They have still only scored 31 goals but they have found a way to win games at this crucial stage of the season. It now looks possible they will stay up after Michael Jackson replaced Sean Dyche and the Clarets are unbeaten in his four matches so far. They have what looks to be a favourable fixture list, with Tottenham the only fixture you would think they would struggle to take anything from. The ties against Aston Villa and Newcastle at Turf Moor look huge, and if they can win both of them, Burnley should remain in the Premier League. Predicted finish – 17th Aston Villa – H – 7 May Tottenham – A – 15 May Aston Villa – A – 19 May Newcastle – H – 22 May  Leeds have conceded the most goals in the Premier League (72), one more than Norwich, and because of that, relegation is still a threat. This year has been a struggle for Leeds and they have been in a dog-fight all season. Injuries to key players have exposed their squad and, after heavy defeats to the likes of Liverpool, Everton and Tottenham, Marcelo Bielsa was sacked and replaced by Jesse Marsch. The American made a poor start but the Whites were unbeaten in five. However, they were thrashed by Manchester City at the weekend and are only two points clear of the drop zone. Leeds still have to play Chelsea and Arsenal, while they travel to Brentford on the last day of the season. The Whites also take on Brighton, with the Seagulls in decent form at the moment. Leeds’ recent wins over Norwich, Wolves and Watford looked to have been enough to keep them up. But Burnley’s resurgence means they will probably need at least one more victory from their final four to seal their place in the Premier League next season. Predicted Finish – 16th Arsenal – A – 7 May Chelsea – H – 17 April Brighton – H – 15 May Brentford – A – 22 May  Everton have never been relegated from the Premier League but there is a real danger of that happening this year. Poor decisions have hit the Toffees hard and they are now relying on Frank Lampard to save them. Everton replaced Carlo Ancelotti with former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez, and despite a good start, it was never going to end well, and the Spaniard was dismissed in January. Lampard has arrived in his place and the Toffees are unbeaten in four at Goodison Park, but defeats away from home to Burnley, West Ham and Liverpool have plunged them into deep trouble. At the moment, it is hard to see Everton picking up another point on the road, given they have lost their last seven away fixtures. So, the home games against Brentford and Crystal Palace are huge. Predicted finish – 18th Leicester – A – 7 May Watford – A – 11 May Brentford – H – 15 May Crystal Palace – H – 19 May Arsenal – A – 22 May  Watford are onto their third manager of the season and they hope Roy Hodgson can keep them in the Premier League. The Hornets started well with Emmanuel Dennis impressing, but things turned sour, and Xisco Munoz was sacked and replaced by Claudio Ranieri. The Italian managed just one league win against Man United and was dismissed after a 3-0 defeat to Norwich. Hodgson has tried to sort out the defence and Watford have managed two wins since he arrived, but they have lost five games in a row and are 12 points from safety. The Hornets still have four matches to play and face Chelsea. But the big clash is against Everton. However, they lost to Leeds, Brentford and Burnley, which means an escape is looking very unlikely. Hodgson knows how to keep teams up, but he might have arrived too late to save Watford… Predicted finish – 19th Crystal Palace – A – 7 May Everton – H – 11 May Leicester – H – 15 May Chelsea – A – 22 May  Norwich have been in the relegation zone the whole season, and on Saturday after defeat to Aston Viilla, they were officially relegated. The Canaries have managed five wins but have lost 23 of their 34 games and have conceded 71 goals. Smith tried his best, but an escape never looked likely and they have to reflect on a very disappointing campaign. Norwich were active in the summer transfer market and brought in 11 players, but it wasn’t enough. Smith’s side still have West Ham and Tottenham to face, so there could be a bit more pain for supporters to endure before they can forget about this campaign altogether.

https://talksport.com/football/1099983/cristiano-ronaldo-bruno-fernandes-varane-brentford/,"Cristiano Ronaldo scores penalty, while Bruno Fernandes and Raphael Varane end droughts as Red Devils get back to winning ways with triumph over Brentford","Manchester United got back to winning ways as they beat Brentford 3-0 in their final game at Old Trafford this season. The Red Devils secured three points in the league for the first time since their win over bottom side Norwich thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane. United opened the scoring just nine minutes into the clash as an unmarked Fernandes volleyed home Anthony Elanga’s cut-back. The strike was Fernandes’ first goal in his last 11 outings. Shortly after the Portugal international’s goal, the Bees had two attempts at equalising – Christian Eriksen and Ivan Toney both having attempts at goal. Brentford were relieved to see Ronaldo’s strike just before half time ruled out by VAR for offside. However, the Bees were soon left with a bigger mountain to climb after the restart. The Red Devils were awarded a penalty after Rico Henry attempted to win the ball back in the box and collided with Ronaldo having been barged off it by the Portuguese seconds earlier. Sure enough, United’s talisman grasped the opportunity after Chris Kavanagh pointed to the spot, making no mistake as he sent a thumping effort past David Raya from the spot. United’s final goal of the evening came from an unlikely source as Raphael Varane netted his first goal when he latched onto Alex Telles’ inswinging corner from the right.    Prior to the game, United fans had organised another another protest against the Glazer family ownership, which was due to result in a mass walkout in the 73rd minute of the match. However, whilst there were banners displaying their discontent towards those running the club, there wasn’t a noticeable walkout from those who attended. Juan Mata received a standing ovation as he made his way for Phil Jones, as the Spaniard made what will likely be his final appearance at Old Trafford, with him expected to leave in the summer. Roy Keane was asked if Man United’s clash against Brentford could have also been Ronaldo’s Red Devils swansong. However, the United legend wasn’t convinced. “We want Glazers Out”#MUFC fans protest the Glazers on the 72nd minute during #MUNBRE pic.twitter.com/kOYxvHNl7r Roy Keane was asked if Man United’s clash against Brentford could have also been Ronaldo’s Red Devils swansong. However, the United legend wasn’t convinced. “I wouldn’t have thought so,” he said. “I know there’s speculation but I can’t imagine Ronaldo not being at Man United next year unless something drastic changes in the summer. “If you look at the goals he’s got, he’s a threat and any manager would want to work with him. Simple as that.” United’s victory effectively cements their place in the European spots as they sit in sixth, whilst Brentford remain on 40 points, eight points from the drop.
