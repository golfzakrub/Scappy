And whether it is a shining example of everything a football ground should be or a right dump doesn’t matter. After all, it is our dump and that’s what counts. Of course, Blues fans have something of a love-hate relationship with St Andrew’s for a while now, or at least with those people tasked with keeping the famous old ground in reasonably decent nick. Blues have been operating at a reduced capacity for the whole of the 2021/2022 campaign, with the ground requiring expensive remedial works. But whatever the rights and wrongs behind the problems at St Andrew’s, it remains the their spiritual home and means just as much to most supporters as the swankiest of big-money stadiums at the likes of Spurs and Arsenal. READ MORE: 'We're happy' - Manager addresses striker future amid Birmingham City links READ MORE: Birmingham City fans left baffled by 'update on update we are waiting for' on St Andrew's safety work But then there are those other grounds we have a hankering for - those of footballing foes which spark warm feelings because of a brilliant victory there or a favourite incident, the culmination of a promotion success or huge cup upset. These days, as more and more modern stadia spring up across the country, another category of favourite springs to mind - those old-fashioned grounds that help carry us back to another era, complete with towering stands, hostile crowds thrust right to the edge of the pitch and the brilliant atmospheres that football should be all about. So, our question to you is what are you favourite football grounds and which are the ones you loathe? For Blues fans, St Andrew’s is always going to be the beating heart, even if two of those heart chambers aren’t even functioning at present. The reopening of the lower tiers in the Kop and Tilton stands cannot come quickly enough because something needs to be done about the atmosphere. But where else do Blues fans feel ‘at home’? Blues writer Brian Dick says: “The recent trip to Blackpool, a sunny Easter weekend by the seaside, was a real opportunity for 3,500 supporters to let their hair down. Unfortunately the team let them down too. “The biennial trips to yo-yo club Fulham are always fun, Blues take a huge following and pack out the away end. Crossing the city to the other place is always something to look forward to. Derby away is always, always eventful.” So they are the good grounds, but what of the ones Blues fans dislike? Brian adds: “In terms of stadiums Blues fans loathe, it depends to be more a personal thing. Reading away is pretty soulless, matches tend to be midweek 8pm kick-offs in a half empty gr0und. “Blackburn’s Ewood Park is always cold and Hull is a long journey, there’s nothing remarkable about the ground and results are always terrible. Elsewhere, West Ham’s London Stadium isn’t really fit for purpose as a football venue.” Now it's time for you say. If the survey below doesn't load, click here.

https://www.football365.com/news/ravanelli-spurs-premier-league-title-conte-manchester-united-new-defence,Ravanelli claims Spurs can win title next season and Man Utd need a ‘whole new defence’,"Fabrizio Ravanelli reckons Spurs can win the Premier League title next season but admits they will have to “fight hard” to achieve that under Antonio Conte. Tottenham have been much better in the second half of the campaign under Conte with the Italian replacing Nuno Espirito Santo at the beginning of November. Nuno left the club after they lost five of his last seven Premier League matches in charge with Spurs sitting ninth in the Premier League. Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Tottenham are now up to fifth under Conte, two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal with the race for the final Champions League spot well underway. And Middlesbrough legend Ravanelli reckons Spurs have a chance of winning the Premier League title next season with Conte at the helm. Ravanelli told The Sun: “I believe he has been doing very well at Tottenham but when a coach, especiallyConte, gets to a team, he needs time. I’m pretty sure he can make tremendous progress and achieve exactly what he has in mind. “Tottenhamhas always been missing something – they never really manage to take that necessary step forward in quality. They have had a good mentality but it’s not been effective in getting the results they want. “Now withConte and Fabio Paratici, they will be able to make the right choices to give them the right identity to win. They will be able to then possibly win thePremier Leaguein this way. Next year will be the turning point.” Ravanelli added: “This year they have less chance than Arsenal [to get top four] but knowing Conte, in these moments, he always wins duels. He is so focused and so determined and I’m pretty sure they will finish fourth and get into the Champions League. “As for winning the Premier League next year, they will have to fight hard. We cannot forget Manchester City and Liverpool. Tottenham have got seven or eight excellent players. “They need to focus on the defence because that is their main weakness. They would also need to strengthen the midfield with new signings and sign a new striker to play alongside Harry Kane. “Kane is the best but he is not enough so they will need to strengthen there next season. It won’t be easy.” Conte was linked with the Man Utd job before taking over at Spurs and Ravanelli reckons the Red Devils need huge changes in the summer to progress under Erik ten Hag. Ravanelli continued: “If Conte had had the possibility to work with theManchester Unitedplayers, certainly it would have been easier for him to achieve certain results. “United have many players who are not fit to wear the shirt or up to the expectation of winning the Premier League and Champions League. There should be some turnover of players. “I don’t want to be nasty but honest. Without naming specific players, the whole defence should be changed completely. It needs radical change. “I truly believe withErik ten Hag, a new cycle is about to start. He did really well at Ajax and enjoyed remarkable results. “He has always given great value to young players. If he starts working with the young players who understand what it means to play for United, they can make the difference and improve.” ",positive,spurs,4
https://www.football365.com/news/door-opens-newcastle-tottenham-price-player-conte-admires-drops-15m-inter-milan,"‘Door opens’ for Tottenham, Newcastle as price for player Conte ‘admires’ drops to £15m","According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United target Stefan De Vrij has been made available for just £15m ahead of this summer. It was reported back in March that Tottenham are targeting De Vrij ‘at the request’ of Antonio Conte. The Spurs boss worked with the centre-back during their time together at Inter Milan. De Vrij has played 161 times for the Italian giants since the start of the 2018/19 campaign. The successful career of Mino Raiola demonstrates the absurdities of modern football The 30-year-old won the Serie A title when Conte was in charge in 2020/21. He is out of contract in 2023 and he is expected to leave Inter Milan this summer. Football Insider are reporting that the ‘door has opened’ for clubs to sign De Vrij, with Tottenham, Newcastle and Aston Villa interested in him. De Vrij is ‘yet to open talks’ with Inter over a new deal so his future is ‘up in the air’. He was previously valued at £40m but he is now available for just £15m. It is stated that Conte is a ‘huge admirer’ of the defender and he wanted Tottenham to sign him in January. Elsewhere,The Daily Mail say that Tottenham are ‘looking at alternatives’ to Pochettino if Conte attempts to exit this summer ‘with Graham Potter and Roberto Mancini among the names set to be considered’. It is understood that Pochettino is ‘largely viewed as the ideal candidate to replace the Italian’ but ‘there is some opposition from within the Tottenham hierarchy’ to his potential return. That ‘resistance has led the club to explore other avenues’ with Potter and Mancini emerging as possible options. Brighton manager Potter was linked with a move to Spurs in the summer when Nuno was appointed and just before Conte’s arrival in north London. The Daily Mail adds that Tottenham have ‘long admired the work Potter has accomplished at Brighton and will be on the club’s radar if they find themselves trying to replace Conte this summer’. Mancini, who is currently manager of the Italian national team, is also ‘an option’ with Spurs’ managing director of football Fabio Paratici ‘an admirer’ of the former Manchester City boss. The Daily Mail adds: ‘It’s important to stress that Tottenham’s due diligence towards the appointment of Conte’s successor remains a matter of contingency preparation, with sources indicating succession planning at football clubs is completely normal. ‘Indeed, Tottenham’s plan A is for Conte to stay in charge heading into next season – and there is a feeling behind the scenes that he will not walk away.’ ",positive,spurs,3
https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-manchester-united-woodward-murtough-judge,"Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots?","Manchester United are switching their senior management about, but will United supporters get the transfer guru that they’ve craved for years? Manchester United reach the end of the 2021/22 season in a state of flux. They’ve played 22 games in all competitions since the start of this calendar year and they’ve won just eight of them, with only three of those wins having come in the last two months. At the start of the year, the club had three easily identifiable aims for the second half of this season: the FA Cup, the Champions League and qualifying for next year’s Champions League. But four months into the new year, and regardless of a stroll-a-thon win against a Brentford side that didn’t seem to want to push them too hard, any optimistic predictions for the end of this season now lie in tatters. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong United were eliminated by Middlesbrough in the FA Cup and Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, while their involvement in the race for fourth place in the Premier League may still be mathematically possible in theory but would depend on such an improbable sequence of results that it’s fair to completely disregard their chances as anything other than fanciful. The potential for a break in the clouds hovering over Old Trafford comes in the form of new manager Erik Ten Hag, who will take control of the team this summer, but the carousel of accusation has long left behind the notion that the fortunes of a football club in the modern era can be changed for the better by the appointment of one person. The problems at Manchester United run deeper than just the manager, and it was never very likely that the appointment of a new one would cure what ails the club. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wasn’t the only member of the Manchester United management team to leave their position last year. Ed Woodward had to (eventually) fall on his sword over his involvement in the European Super League fiasco, though he didn’t leave his position until the start of February, and now Matt Judge, who’d previously been described as Woodward’s ‘right hand’, has resigned from his position as Manchester United’s director of football negotiations. This follows the decision of the club to appoint Richard Arnold as the new chief executive in January and then John Murtough as director of football in February. Judge, who is currently working out his notice period with the club, will not be missed by the club’s supporters. As the man responsible for negotiating transfers and contracts for Manchester United, Judge became one of the most influential people working behind the scenes at Old Trafford, but after what has come to be considered transfer failure after transfer failure, United fans seem pretty much agreed that just about anybody would be better. Woodward and Judge were, after all, the pair who came up with the wheeze of extending player contracts as a way of maintaining asset value on business spreadsheets, which many believe has been a key reason behind the United squad becoming so unbalanced, while reaffirming to critics the fundamental differences between running Manchester United for the benefit of the stock market over just getting on with being, well, a football club.  It has been suggested that the reason for Judge’s departure at this time is related to Murtough being promoted over his head and cutting off his direct contact with Arnold, though it should be added that most of this does at least seem to be passing fairly amicably, which in itself might be considered somewhat surprising when we recall the extent of the factionalisation of the United dressing room and the steady torrent of leaks that has been flowing from behind those doors over the course of this season. United supporters certainly seem to know who they want to replace him; Paul Mitchell has been earning admiring glances for years. After moving from Southampton to Spurs with Mauricio Pochettino in 2014, he left White Hart Lane two years later to work first with RB Leipzig and then with Monaco as a sporting director in a position that he has held since 2020; Newcastle were said to be considering his services at the end of last year before settling on Dan Ashworth instead, a decision which isn’t exactly going as Newcastle might have hoped. Mitchell is understood to have a close relationship with Ralf Rangnick from his time in Leipzig. He was constantly linked with a move to Old Trafford when the club didn’t even have a sporting director, and now that Murtough is in that position – with Darren Fletcher as technical director – the fans are clamouring for him to be offered Judge’s old position. After all, Judge isn’t the only person from this side of the club to have left his position in the last few months; chief scout Jim Lawlor and head of global scouting Marcel Bout have also departed. But this might not be straightforward. The Mirror has reported that, ‘The Englishman [Mitchell] has been tempted to stay by the offer of a sizeable budget to spend at Monaco in the upcoming window’, based on reporting in Foot Mercato, which claims that Chelsea are also interested in his services. There is also little to suggest that Mitchell is unhappy in Monaco, while others might argue that, although his record with Spurs – where he was behind the decisions to take Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Toby Alderweireld to the club – was excellent, his record at Monaco has not quite left him above criticism. And as ever with Manchester United, all of this raises as many questions as it answers. If Murtough and Fletcher are now running the club’s recruitment, where would Mitchell fit into the equation? If Darren Fletcher is a ‘technical director’, then what is he doing in the dugout on a Saturday afternoon? What exactly is his role? Because even his own attempts to clarify it haven’t exactly sounded convincing. But those questions will keep coming. How do Manchester United plan to attract the elite-level players to which they believe themselves to be entitled if they can’t offer Champions League football? Where does Ralf Rangnick fit into all of this, especially considering that he will now be mixing his consultancy duties with being the head coach of the Austrian national team? Can any new structure or head coach change the culture of leaking to the press which has been relentless this season from a hopelessly factionalised dressing room? And ultimately, will Joel Glazer still be having the final say on all of these changes? Time is of the essence.It’s not that long until the end of the season and the reopening of the transfer window, and few would argue that Manchester United’s squad doesn’t need major work. Somewhere in this thicket of names there may be a combination that works, but while the departure of Matt Judge was necessary (if anything, it’s surprising that he stayed beyond the departure of Woodward), it doesn’t add much to the club ahead of what is likely to be an extremely busy summer. For many Manchester United supporters, the likely truth remains that the club cannot be truly reformed until the Glazer family have left. But with that looking no more likely now than at any other time over the last 17 years, supporters are left hoping against logic that this time the leopards running their clubs might finally change their spots. The post-Ferguson transition is now completing its ninth year without the club’s fortunes having substantially changed, and promises that this time things will definitely be different should probably be taken with a pinch of salt.

https://www.football365.com/news/mailbox-liverpool-quadruple-man-utd-rangnick-brentford,Would this season be a success if Liverpool won one out of four from here?,"The Mailbox ponders how Liverpool’s season will be viewed if they don’t win any of the three remaining trophies they are going for this month. Get your views in to theeditor@football365.com… What qualifies as Liverpool success? I think it’s pretty crazy that Liverpool could finish the season as FA Cup finalists, champs league finalists, runner up in the league and winner of the league cup and pretty much every fan will think of it as a failed season. Myself included. By any other standard any two of those four achievements is a superb season for 99% of teams. Which I guess highlights just how high Klopp has raised our expectations now. I said after we drew with city that the title was gone. That was a must win game. My friends (also reds) said I was pessimistic and city would def drop points along the way and we would win every game. Winning every game for us at that point would mean a 14 game winning streak, one of the longest in club history. So far we’ve done that. But pep just knows how to put giant runs together and looking at the calendar at the time I couldn’t see any teams taking points off city. Still don’t. 4 games left and it’s looking ever more likely that the season will finish with city being one point above us and that game Vs city being a costly one (though really any game we dropped points is just as costly). But I genuinely believe (as objectively as I can) that we will win a cup treble this season. Regardless of who makes it to the final it will be a very tough game with either two teams who play fast attacking football and a high tempo pressure game filled with talented players or Liverpool against a team of dark arts masters who are older than the Bible with twice the staying power. Would other Liverpool fans be disappointed with a cup treble? I want to say no but I know in my heart of hearts that that premier League trophy is the one we really want. I’d swap the champs league for the premier League this year for sure. I shouldn’t be disappointed, especially considering only a few years ago we almost ceased to exist. But I know that pang of regret will be there anyway…Lee  Eye on the ballIsaac, believe me, my eye is very much on the ball. I am making no assumptions about Liverpool winning their last 4 games. In fact in my mail on Sunday I said it was a real possibility that they wouldn’t. I am very worried about the game against Tottenham, just as I was worried about the Newcastle game, worried about the Man United game, worried about the Everton game and worried about pretty much every other game Liverpool play. I do find the comment about the ‘ridiculous’ concern from Liverpool fans about where City could drop points slightly odd though. Isn’t that what football fans do? Are Spurs, Arsenal, Leeds, Burnley, & Everton fans not scouring the fixtures list to see where points may be won and lost? Seriously, if you’re not doing that are you even a real football fan?Mike, LFC, London   Everton relegation bad for Man City Not only would Everton’s relegation be bad for the city it would also be bad news for Manchester City. As it stands City only have the Manchester derby as the game where “form goes out of the window” but Liverpool have two, with the Merseyside derby and the rivalry with United. It is rare that Liverpool actually do the double over Everton (this season aside) and it is hard to imagine a promoted team taking points off them. With the margin between the two being so small, Everton’s relegation might make all the difference next season and (perish the thought) beyond.CDM  Departing manager bounce 29th of April – Rangnick appointed Austria manager for next season. 2nd May, Man United play their first convincing game of Rangnick’s tenure, displaying flair, composure, and effort. It turns out these players can play, and they can defend, and score goals too. Coincidence? Or motivation? And if you believe it was ‘just Brentford’ consider that if United had played this way and won all the games we played against teams in the bottom half of the premiership we would have had 16 points more. Contrary to popular opinion, this team doesn’t need surgery. It needs a spark.Ved Sen, MUFC.  Ralf finds the formula Man Utd finally played good football. Huge shout outs to Mata & Matic. All the others players have 100% and it showed. Is it a coincidence Man Utd plays good football without Maguire & Rashford? The former simply doesn’t deserve to be in a top six team, the latter is a footballer turned book writer who can’t be bothered to run on a football pitch. If only Ralf had found this formula earlier. CheersAshwin – Man Utd fan  Where did all the nicknames go? Two things which have been rolling around in my head recently – What ever happened to nicknames for players? It feels like they are not as prominent anymore. In the past, here in sunny and loadshedded South Africa, we had wonderful nicknames for players like Ace, Computer, and my favourite, Lucas ‘Masterpieces’ Moripe. According to Wikipedia, Steven Gerrard is referred to as the ‘Hammer of Huyton’. I can’t recall ever singing for the ‘Hammer’. ‘Scores from forty yards’, uncountable times. Was he referred to as the Hammer at all up in England? I know Luis Suarez went by ‘El pistolero’ but this seemed to be more widely used for him in Uruguay? Maybe Salah’s ‘Egyptian King’ moniker might currently be applicable but in truth, are nicknames still assigned? I’d love if we could start calling them James ‘the Anvil’ Milner and Joel ‘Pureclass’ Matip. My second mental wandering I confine to brackets.

The Ajax boss has reportedly agreed terms in principle with United but is yet to be officially announced as their next permanent manager. Gossip: Manchester United linked with Premier League trio It is thought that confirmation of Ten Hag’s decision to swap the Eredivisie for the Premier League will come after the upcoming Dutch Cup final this weekend, which will see his side face PSV Eindhoven. With the 52-year-old’s arrival looking imminent, a number of stars have been linked with the club as they look to rebuild on what has been another disappointing season. United have made it five consecutive seasons without a trophy after a campaign of turmoil on and off the pitch and could miss out on qualification for the Champions League next season. Arsenal and Spurs are currently ahead of the Red Devils in the race for the top four. Whether the prospect of no Champions League football next season will affect who the club will target this summer, it remains to be seen. However, that wont stop a number of players from around the globe from being linked with a move to Manchester. ESPN are reporting that the latest name to be on the Man Utd shortlist is Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni. The Frenchman, who has already made eight appearances for the senior national side at the age of 22, has been in fine form in Ligue 1 this season. His performances have drawn attention from a number of top sides around Europe, including Liverpool, Chelsea and Juventus. The 22-year-old now appears to be on the shortlist for manager-to-be Ten Hag as he looks to improve what has been a troublesome position for a number of years at Old Trafford. This season Scott McTominay, Fred, Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba have all vied for a starting role in initially Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side and, more recently, under Ralf Rangnick. Tchouameni’s international teammates Pogba is out-of-contract in the summer and doesn’t look likely to agree a new deal whilst Matic, at 33, is hardly a long-term solution. Scotland international McTominay and Brazilian Fred have improved this season but if United are to take the next step and begin challenging for titles again, they will need reinforcements and Monaco’s Tchouameni could be brought in to do just that. It is also worth mentioning that Donny van de Beek, who is currently on loan at Everton, could feature more prominently next season after working under Ten Hag at Ajax. ",positive,spurs,1
https://www.football365.com/news/antonio-conte-appointed-tottenham-hotspur-boss-lured-daniel-levy-contagious-enthusiasm,Conte appointed Spurs boss – lured by Levy’s ‘contagious enthusiasm’,"Former Chelsea boss Antonio Conte has been appointed as Tottenham Hotspur’s new manager and he is “extremely happy” to return to management. Spurs have acted quickly to appoint Conte. He replaces Nuno Espirito Santo, who was sacked on Monday. The Italian has penned an 18-month contract. He previously led Chelsea to the Premier League title in 2016/17. Antonio Conte by the numbers: Games, trophies, signings… He had previously been in advanced talks with Spurs in June about becoming Jose Mourinho’s successor, but they broke down after the two parties were at odds over key issues. However, managing director Fabio Paratici is now in position at the Premier League club and has a strong relationship with the 52-year-old, having worked with him at Juventus. And those differences have now been overcome, with chairman Daniel Levy looking to the serial winner to turn Spurs back into a force in English football. “I am extremely happy to return to coaching, and to do so at a Premier League club that has the ambition to be a protagonist again,” Conte told the club website. “Tottenham Hotspur has state-of-the-art facilities and one of the best stadiums in the world. “I can’t wait to start working to convey to the team and the fans the passion, mentality and determination that have always distinguished me, as a player and as a coach. “Last summer our union did not happen because the end of my relationship with Inter was still too recent and emotionally too involved with the end of the season, so I felt that it wasn’t yet the right time to return to coaching. “But the contagious enthusiasm and determination of Daniel Levy in wanting to entrust me with this task had already hit the mark. Now that the opportunity has returned, I have chosen to take it with great conviction.” Nuno was relieved of his duties after Levy and Paratici met on Sunday to discuss his future, with the news delivered early on Monday morning. The Portuguese was a condemned man following Saturday’s 3-0 home loss to Manchester United, when fans chanted ‘You don’t know what you’re doing’ and roundly booed him at full-time. Spurs have lost five of the last seven Premier League games and have gone two hours and 16 minutes without having a shot on goal. Conte inherits a team in ninth position in the table, five points off the top four after 10 games. The Italian, who is expected to be given some funds in January to strengthen the squad, is due to take training on Tuesday and be in charge of Thursday’s Europa Conference League clash with Vitesse Arnhem. He becomes the fourth manager to cross the divide between Stamford Bridge and north London, following Glenn Hoddle, Andre Villas-Boas and Mourinho in managing both clubs. Paratici said: “We are delighted to welcome Antonio to the club. His track record speaks for itself, with vast experience and trophies in both Italy and England. “I know first-hand the qualities Antonio can bring to us, having worked with him at Juventus, and look forward to seeing his work with our talented group of players.” Spurs said an update on Conte’s coaching staff will follow in due course.

Son grabbed his second of the game and 19th of the season in style as he curled a 20-yard effort into the top corner to put the seal on Spurs’ victory. Spurs settle another set of jitters with a masterclass from Son Heung-min He had earlier set up Harry Kane’s opener from a corner and doubled the lead when he turned and shot on the hour mark. The quality of the goal left Conte wondering which was Son’s strongest foot, but the Italian said moments like that will only count for something if Spurs achieve their goal of finishing in the top six. “I gave him a big hug because after an amazing goal my question was which is his favourite foot, right or left?” Conte said. “He scored a fantastic goal and three minutes before when I spoke with him I said, ‘Go for five or six minutes and then I have to make a change’. “I said to him that when you listened that I wanted to make a change and you decide to score this amazing goal. “We are talking about a great player, fantastic player. But it’s important at the end of the season to celebrate a big achievement with the team. Otherwise it remains only a personal success only to score these types of goals.” OH SONNY YOU BEAUTY — Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) May 1, 2022 The victory saw Spurs get back on track in their quest for Champions League qualification after taking one point in their previous two games. Conte knew it was especially important to win as they visit title-chasing Liverpool next weekend. “It was a good performance against a really good team,” he said. “The game wasn’t easy and we knew very well that despite them making eight changes from the last game against Roma you can see the quality, you can see the squad that Leicester has. “I think then we deserved to win the game. “For sure we got three points in an important moment of the season, especially because in the next games we are going to face first Liverpool and then Arsenal. “Today it was vital to get three points. There is only one result and a lot of pressure, but I said to my players to live this moment, to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months. “I think no one at the start of the season could imagine Tottenham challenging for a place in the Champions League, especially in November when there was a change, and for this reason we have to be satisfied that we stay in this position to fight for a big achievement.” ",positive,spurs,5

READ MORE: Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters Conte, who has 12 months left on his contract, has continually refused to commit his long-term future to Spurs, but insists the latest round of speculation is not true. He said: “Obviously I think that it’s good that other clubs appreciate my work. This is one thing. But the truth is that I don’t like when people try to invest news – only to speak, only to create problems. “This is not right, not fair for me, for the clubs involved and for my players. “Also because we’re really focused on these five games to get a fantastic result for us. I repeat, this type of situation makes me smile. “But I think that also the people that want to tell something about this have to show respect for all the people involved in this situation, and not invent fake news and tell a lot of lies. “In this situation, who works in football – players or managers – know very well that at this point of the season, a lot of fake news starts to go out.” The Italian does not want this issue to be a distraction for the club’s push for Champions League qualification. Spurs are two points behind Arsenal with five games to go and Conte has called on a joint effort to get over the line. “In this moment our fans, me, the players, the club, the fans we need to be focused, we need to be concentrated on an important target for us,” he said. “We have a big opportunity to try to get a place in the Champions League. “It’s a big opportunity for us because no one can imagine to stay and fight for this target in this league now in this moment. In the past it was different, but now you know very well what I said in the past that it would be a miracle to get this achievement. “We are doing something special for the situation we faced this season. I spoke with my players and its the same with our fans, they have to continue to support us and push us until the end. “We’re living this dream. We have to continue until the end to get a place in the Champions League. It’s right to underline that we are fighting for a target that wasn’t in our mind at the start of the season. “For this reason I want to push everybody at the club to have great enthusiasm, great passion, our fans to stay with us and to back us from the start until the end. “Now it would be very important to be focused and not listen to fake news and the people that for sure want to create problems for the environment. “We have to play these five games and then you know, because I answer a lot of times, that at the end of the season in a private way I will speak with my club and I will see the best solution. “We’re working very hard and my players know very well we’re very focused. We’re speaking a lot about this opportunity. “We have to live this situation with passion, enthusiasm and joy. I repeat, we deserve to stay there and to fight for a place in the Champions League.

Spurs have been improving since Conte took over in early November to replace Nuno Espirito Santo, who lost five of his last seven Premier League matches to leave the club ninth in the table. Since then, Tottenham have gradually risen up the table and now find themselves fifth, two points off fourth-placed Arsenal with five matches to play. Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters Spurs have the Gunners to play in the north London derby in a fortnight’s time with the match probably going a long way to deciding which of the two teams will play Champions League football next season. However, there have been rumours that Conte could jump ship this summer whatever happens in the final straight with a report insisting that the Italian has offered himself to Paris Saint-Germain. Pochettino is almost certain to leave this summer, with the manager and PSG attempting to agree a compensation package which would allow him to depart, as the French giants would have to fork out€15m to sack him. The report on Monday claimed that there has also been ‘contact’ between Pochettino and Daniel Levy with the Tottenham chairman ‘trying to convince the coach to return to Spurs’. And now the Daily Mail say that Tottenham are ‘looking at alternatives’ to Pochettino if Conte attempts to exit this summer ‘withGraham Potterand Roberto Mancini among the names set to be considered’. It is understood that Pochettino is ‘largely viewed as the ideal candidate to replace the Italian’ but ‘there is some opposition from within the Tottenham hierarchy’ to his potential return. That ‘resistance has led the club to explore other avenues’ with Potter and Mancini emerging as possible options. Brighton manager Potter was linked with a move to Spurs in the summer when Nuno was appointed and just before Conte’s arrival in north London. The Daily Mail adds that Tottenham have ‘long admired the work Potter has accomplished at Brighton and will be on the club’s radar if they find themselves trying to replace Conte this summer’. Mancini, who is currently manager of the Italian national team, is also ‘an option’ with Spurs’ managing director of football Fabio Paratici ‘an admirer’ of the former Manchester City boss. The Daily Mail adds: ‘It’s important to stress that Tottenham’s due diligence towards the appointment of Conte’s successor remains a matter of contingency preparation, with sources indicating succession planning at football clubs is completely normal. ‘Indeed, Tottenham’s plan A is for Conte to stay in charge heading into next season – and there is a feeling behind the scenes that he will not walk away.’ ",positive,spurs,5

Reports emerged this week linking Conte with a move to PSG with the French club apparently set to move on Mauricio Pochettino at the end of the season. Pochettino is likely to win the Ligue 1 title this campaign but their failure to advance beyond the Round of 16 in the Champions League has sealed his fate. Is Pochettino a better manager for Spurs than Conte? AndLe Parisien has claimed that Conte ‘has already offered himself up’ to PSG and there have been rumours that Daniel Levy would like Pochettino to return to Spurs. Conte has a reputation for short stints in jobs, while there have been rumours that the Spurs boss wants a £30m wage package to take over at the French giants and former PSG winger Rothen thinks he’s the wrong man for the job. Rothen said on RMC Sport show Rothen S’enflamme (via Sport Witness): “Of course not. When you hear these demands, stay where you are. Certainly don’t come to a club like PSG, who need to improve their image, one far more healthy. “You need people who are passionate about football, and I’m not saying Conte isn’t, but he seems more passionate about his chequebook than managing Tottenham, PSG or another team. That’s already problematic.” ⚡ @RothenJerome : Quand tu entends les exigences de Conte… Mais reste où tu es ! Ne viens surtout pas au PSG.” #RMClive pic.twitter.com/JkegJn6Fn0 — Rothen s’enflamme (@Rothensenflamme) April 26, 2022 However, Rothen did admit that if the right director of football came in to replace Leonardo, with Conte as his choice for manager, then he might look at things from a different perspective. When asked if Conte would be a good appointment if he came in for the “right reasons”, Rothen added: “Yes, every day, because Conte brings that grinta, and I think that he identifies really quickly with the club he manages, but not with those financial conditions. That’s not possible.” The reports linking Conte to PSG have reportedly ‘irritated’ Spurs chairman Levy after having a similar ‘distraction’ last summer when speculation was rife around Harry Kane’s future.

But what about from the head? It’s no great surprise that Mauricio Pochettino looks set to lose his job as PSG manager. Having failed to win the Champions League, not even romping home to the Ligue 1 title was ever going to save him. Even so, the speed with which the Parisiens have apparently set about binning him off is a brutal old business. It’s been a strange spell in Paris for Pochettino. It has, predictably, brought the trophies his CV lacked. It has, just as predictably, exposed the disingenuous nature of the previous arguments against his coaching talents because he hadn’t won trophies. Because it was never really about the trophies; it never is. It’s just using whatever stick is available to beat the target of your criticism. Had he won a Carabao or FA Cup with his magnificent Spurs side, the ‘no trophies’ argument would simply have become ‘only a Carabao’. Even winning the 2019 Champions League would simply have been memory-holed and written off as a freak occurrence. If that sounds implausible, just have a look at what Manchester United fans were saying when people started talking up the City-Liverpool rivalry as the Premier League’s greatest. ‘Only one Premier League title’ was the cudgel against Liverpool and Klopp. Anything can be written off if it’s inconvenient. Pochettino has done precisely as well as anyone could have realistically expected at PSG, but inevitably that has seen his stock fall. Anyone could win Ligue 1 with PSG, it’s meaningless, as long as you ignore the fact that Thomas Tuchel could not pull it off last season. And no manager has delivered the Champions League title they crave and it remains doubtful whether any manager can overcome the disadvantage that comes from trying to level up from a weaker domestic league to the teak-tough knockout stages. His reign in Paris has been flawed as it was always likely to be. His next job after Spurs always had to be one of the superclubs, but PSG always seemed the very worst fit despite his links to the club in its former guise as just a football club. Pochettino’s ethos is all about the collective – “you sign a contract to train, not to play” – and that was never a good fit for a club that is a branding and promotional tool first and football team second. The superstars will play, must play, and that’s that. His detractors use his flawed spell in Paris as evidence that there remains something second tier about him, that he isn’t quite up to the biggest jobs. Really all that we know is that he wasn’t right for this specific one of the biggest jobs. The criticism is unsurprising, but what is strange is that there also now seems to be some negative retrospective reappraisal of his time at Spurs, much of it coming from Spurs fans themselves. Nothing that has happened to either Spurs or Pochettino since his departure appears to support this view, but it’s definitely there. And that’s because, inevitably, the news of his imminent Paris exit sparks talk of a Spurs return. The timing is key here, because even a couple of weeks ago it would not have played out quite the same. When the Manchester United job was still available and Antonio Conte’s Spurs appeared to have struck gold by simply scoring four goals every week, the talk would have been more in the direction of United. But Erik Ten Hag is in at Manchester United, and Spurs have gone two moribund games without a shot on target against Brighton and Brentford. Conte is once again making eyes at the exit door and uncertainty has returned. Champions League football has also gone from ‘probable’ to ‘unlikely’. So would and should Spurs consider bringing Poch back? The case from the heart is easily made. There is without doubt unfinished business on both sides here, and Pochettino has made no secret of his desire to return to the club one day. The appeal of just running with the energia universal vibes and bringing him back, re-signing Christian Eriksen and re-swapping Bryan Gil for Erik Lamela should be obvious even to those dreary trophy-counters turned trophy-dismissers. But is there an argument to be made with the head? We’re saying yes. And it’s this. Antonio Conte is a better manager than Mauricio Pochettino, but is he a better Spurs manager at this moment? That’s less clear-cut.  The reports of his interest in the PSG job coming moments after news that Pochettino was likely on his way out are the key. His camp moved to brief against those reports, but the fact is that even if not true they are entirely believable and plausible. He is not a manager for the long haul at even the biggest clubs, and certainly not at Spurs. He has achieved a lot in a short space of time in the “painful rebuild” that was already overdue when Pochettino left Spurs in 2019 and became more and more urgent as Jose Mourinho huffed and sulked around the place for a year and a half. If he were a manager Spurs could realistically keep for five years, then everything Conte has done since November would be fine and dandy. From where he found them they had no business being in Champions League contention this season. If this was stage one of a proper new five-year plan they would be ahead of schedule. But with Conte, Spurs are always against the clock. His contract runs only to the end of next season and even that looks a long way away. The possible 12-month extension to that contract even more so. There is no escaping the sense that however things are currently going in what has been an up-and-down five months he has always had and will always have one eye on the exit door. Spurs will always be in this curious stalled position while Conte is manager. He’s not going to instantly turn them into top-level contenders again because nobody could, but any improvements he does make – and there have been plenty – are caveated into oblivion by the near-certain knowledge that he won’t be around to finish the job. Under Conte, Spurs are far better than they were without him, but it all feels oddly directionless. He is laying solid foundations for a palace that will never be built. Under Pochettino, Spurs would at the very least have the prospect of a manager who might still be around to finish what he started. And even if it did go horribly wrong, as the “never go back” truism and the fact this is Spurs suggest is quite likely, the closure that would provide – even if painful – is something both club and manager need to properly move on. It’s not as strong as the case from the heart, admittedly, but it’s there. There’s no denying an element of Tobias Funke “but it might work for us” to it all. Yet it’s hardly damp-eyed delusion to look at Conte and Pochettino and conclude that both men are probably better suited to the other’s job. And even then, wanting to stick with Conte is a perfectly viable position that it should be entirely possible for Spurs fans or anyone else to hold without having to denigrate what Pochettino achieved and could still offer. At the very, very least, Pochettino’s likely availability and keenness given the closing-off of alternative avenues offers the security of a better and cheaper back-up option than Spurs could realistically hope for should Conte’s wandering eye take him elsewhere.

The former Chelsea boss replaced Nuno Espirito Santo at Spurs back in November. Tottenham’s fortunes have improved since Conte took over. He has won 17 of his 31 games in charge across all competitions. Is Pochettino a better manager for Spurs than Conte? Spurs are in the running for a Champions League place. They are two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal with five games to go. It was reported earlier this week that Conte has ‘offered himself’ to PSG. The Ligue 1 side are currently managed by former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino. The Argentinian is under pressure at the moment. PSG are 13 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 but they were dumped out of the Champions League by Real Madrid. The Athletic have noted that reports linking Conte with PSG have ‘irritated’ Levy. Tottenham experienced a similar ‘distraction’ in 2020/21 when Harry Kane announced that he wanted to leave before the season concluded. They add: ‘There is generally a desire at the club to block out the noise and get on with it. ‘There is also an acceptance that volatility is part of the package when you appoint Conte, and that the focus has to be on the team overcoming their recent blip and qualifying for the Champions League. It’s also inevitable that when you have one of the game’s elite managers, they will be linked with other clubs — especially when you are not in the Champions League yourselves. ‘That said, there are some who feel Conte has hardly dampened speculation over the last couple of months, given the way in which he’s refused to talk about his future at Spurs beyond the immediate term. ‘As for the players, with no midweek fixture they were given pre-arranged days off on Sunday and Monday, and are not expected to have been too affected by the reports. ‘In general, Conte is very popular with the players, though there have been times, most notably after the post-Burnley meltdown in February, where they have been unsettled by the up-and-down nature of their head coach’s mood.’ ",positive,spurs,4
https://www.football365.com/news/manchester-united-treble-liverpool-quadruple-mediawatch-stan-collymore,Who thinks the Manchester United Treble beats a Liverpool Quadruple?,"Stan Collymore, that’s who, though we think it’s largely because Stan Collymore was playing in 1999. Hit Quad Mediawatch had to check that Stan Collymore is actually only 51 after reading his latest ‘it were better in the olden days’ column in the Daily Mirror. His contention is that actually, Liverpool winning the Quadruple – literally never achieved before in football – would not be that impressive in the grand scheme of things. Of course, it would be a ‘fantastic achievement’ but ‘it won’t be any greater than Tottenham’s Double in 1960-61, Arsenal’s in 1970-71, or Liverpool’s in 1985-86’. We’re fascinated to hear how four trophies are actually no better than two, apart from ‘because it were better in the olden days’. We’re fascinated to hear how Arsenal’s 1970-71 side – who crashed out of the League Cup and Europe – are actually the equal of a team that wins all four trophies available at a time when they are up against the greatest club side of the last decade. We’re fascinated to hear how Liverpool’s 1985/86 side – barred from Europe but beaten by mid-table QPR in the League Cup –are actually the equal of a team that wins all four trophies available at a time when they are up against the greatest club side of the last decade. And then comes ‘Manchester United’s Treble in 1998-99 which, pound for pound, would still be the greatest achievement of all’. Why? Even the staunchest United fan would have to agree that four is a bigger number than three. United won the title with 79 points, a total surpassed by Liverpool and Manchester City this season with several games to spare. They also won the FA Cup and the Champions League but they lost in the third round of the League Cup. And yet that is still the better achievement than winning all four trophies? Because everything was better when Stan was playing? Collymore offers literally no explanation why United winning three trophies is better than Liverpool potentially winning four, other than a lack of ‘financial doping’, which kind of ignores two things: 1) United spent rather a lot of money to win those trophies and 2) The ‘financial doping’ of Manchester City, United and Chelsea in modern times makes it even more remarkable if Liverpool win four trophies. He then writes that when he played, ‘Matt Le Tissier spent his career with the Saints, but he’d have been taken on by one of the big boys after a couple of years these days’, to which we offer the words ‘Harry’ and ‘Kane’. We could also point out that Le Tissier turned down several moves away from Southampton but actually, we have already given that argument more credence than it deserves. ‘Spurs, Arsenal and Kenny Dalglish’s Liverpool all hit the heights with smaller squads than Jurgen Klopp’s Reds and City have at their disposal today’. They hit smaller heights with smaller squads at a time when all their rivals had smaller squads too; Spurs played 49 games to win their double and Liverpool have played 56 games already. You’re comparing apples with oranges and deciding that pineapples are better.  Done Ron Ron Ron ‘At least you can rely on Cristiano Ronaldo to lift the spirits,’ writes Neil Custis in The Sun. ‘A sparkling display, capped by his 24th goal of the season from the penalty spot, gave Manchester United fans something to cheer. In fact, he has probably given them the only things to cheer this season.’ Is this the same Ronaldo and indeed the same Neil Custis that collided to bring us these words in February? ‘The truth that is now staring everyone in the face, and clearly Ronaldo himself, is that his days as a top-class footballer are over. ‘It has been an admirable battle against father time but he is now losing it.’ ‘Losing it’ and yet now, less than three months later (and three months older for Ronaldo), ‘they need him still, even at 37, as they look to the future’. But, but, but… ‘The problem, though, is that when the ball is at his feet, or on his head, there is no magic any more, it has all gone.’ It’s almost like – and stop me if this is blowing your minds – Ronaldo had a blip in form at the same time as Manchester United were utterly atrocious and he is now neither completely finished nor the future for United. But why acknowledge middle ground when you can lurch wildly between extremes? Somebody give Custis one of those heated lavender packs to treat his whiplash.   Fergie timeHeadline on The Sun website as Ken Lawrence writes about – and we had to check this – a 3-0 victory: ‘Man Utd verdict: Final home game played against backdrop of depression and disillusion, it’s a far cry from Fergie days’ It’s been nine f***ing years; get over it. ‘For the last home match of the season came agains the backdrop of depression and disillusion at a club that under Sir Alex Ferguson ruled the Premier League and on a couple of occasions did so in Europe too. ‘This is a very different United to the one Fergie guided to 13 titles, two Champions League successes and so much more silver wear.’ ‘Silver wear’ has made us laugh at least (it’s the pick of about 427 mistakes, including a description of Ronaldo as a ‘waining star’ and a brief discussion of ‘parametres’), but the rest of this is utterly miserable. It is a ‘very different United’ but how many times can that be written? Thousands, it seems. Manchester United have not had a very good season, but a 3-0 win over Brentford gave Lawrence the chance to write about the farewell of Juan Mata or maybe the promise of Anthony Elanga. That he watched that victory and essentially wrote ‘this Manchester United is not as good as Fergie’s Manchester United’ says a great deal about tabloid journalism and its obsession with a past in which they were still relevant.  Do one, Ron, RonKen Lawrence on The Sun website: ‘Ronaldo does not fit those parametres no matter that he had a sparkle about him against Brentford in what was his best all – round performance in months. ‘And in those months there have been hints for months that without Champions League football next season he will head off. ‘He certainly won’t want to be involved in the Europa League or perish the thought, playing in Europe’s third tier Conference.’ Ken Lawrence on the back page of The Sun: ‘CRISTIANO RONALDO dropped his biggest hint yet that he wants to stay at Manchester United – after mouthing: I’m not finished.’ That all seems perfectly clear.  Down, down, deeper and downElsewhere in Stan Collymore land, he seems to think that Burnley’s survival absolutely would not reflect badly on the recently sacked Sean Dyche, in fact ‘the opposite because every player at Turf Moor is a Dyche player’, and yet Leeds’ relegation would be down to ‘the over-egging of the Marcelo Bielsa pudding’. Now try and hold both of those opinions at the same time without getting a throbbing headache.  ",positive,spurs,2

Manchester United reach the end of the 2021/22 season in a state of flux. They’ve played 22 games in all competitions since the start of this calendar year and they’ve won just eight of them, with only three of those wins having come in the last two months. At the start of the year, the club had three easily identifiable aims for the second half of this season: the FA Cup, the Champions League and qualifying for next year’s Champions League. But four months into the new year, and regardless of a stroll-a-thon win against a Brentford side that didn’t seem to want to push them too hard, any optimistic predictions for the end of this season now lie in tatters. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong United were eliminated by Middlesbrough in the FA Cup and Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, while their involvement in the race for fourth place in the Premier League may still be mathematically possible in theory but would depend on such an improbable sequence of results that it’s fair to completely disregard their chances as anything other than fanciful. The potential for a break in the clouds hovering over Old Trafford comes in the form of new manager Erik Ten Hag, who will take control of the team this summer, but the carousel of accusation has long left behind the notion that the fortunes of a football club in the modern era can be changed for the better by the appointment of one person. The problems at Manchester United run deeper than just the manager, and it was never very likely that the appointment of a new one would cure what ails the club. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wasn’t the only member of the Manchester United management team to leave their position last year. Ed Woodward had to (eventually) fall on his sword over his involvement in the European Super League fiasco, though he didn’t leave his position until the start of February, and now Matt Judge, who’d previously been described as Woodward’s ‘right hand’, has resigned from his position as Manchester United’s director of football negotiations. This follows the decision of the club to appoint Richard Arnold as the new chief executive in January and then John Murtough as director of football in February. Judge, who is currently working out his notice period with the club, will not be missed by the club’s supporters. As the man responsible for negotiating transfers and contracts for Manchester United, Judge became one of the most influential people working behind the scenes at Old Trafford, but after what has come to be considered transfer failure after transfer failure, United fans seem pretty much agreed that just about anybody would be better. Woodward and Judge were, after all, the pair who came up with the wheeze of extending player contracts as a way of maintaining asset value on business spreadsheets, which many believe has been a key reason behind the United squad becoming so unbalanced, while reaffirming to critics the fundamental differences between running Manchester United for the benefit of the stock market over just getting on with being, well, a football club.  It has been suggested that the reason for Judge’s departure at this time is related to Murtough being promoted over his head and cutting off his direct contact with Arnold, though it should be added that most of this does at least seem to be passing fairly amicably, which in itself might be considered somewhat surprising when we recall the extent of the factionalisation of the United dressing room and the steady torrent of leaks that has been flowing from behind those doors over the course of this season. United supporters certainly seem to know who they want to replace him; Paul Mitchell has been earning admiring glances for years. After moving from Southampton to Spurs with Mauricio Pochettino in 2014, he left White Hart Lane two years later to work first with RB Leipzig and then with Monaco as a sporting director in a position that he has held since 2020; Newcastle were said to be considering his services at the end of last year before settling on Dan Ashworth instead, a decision which isn’t exactly going as Newcastle might have hoped. Mitchell is understood to have a close relationship with Ralf Rangnick from his time in Leipzig. He was constantly linked with a move to Old Trafford when the club didn’t even have a sporting director, and now that Murtough is in that position – with Darren Fletcher as technical director – the fans are clamouring for him to be offered Judge’s old position. After all, Judge isn’t the only person from this side of the club to have left his position in the last few months; chief scout Jim Lawlor and head of global scouting Marcel Bout have also departed. But this might not be straightforward. The Mirror has reported that, ‘The Englishman [Mitchell] has been tempted to stay by the offer of a sizeable budget to spend at Monaco in the upcoming window’, based on reporting in Foot Mercato, which claims that Chelsea are also interested in his services. There is also little to suggest that Mitchell is unhappy in Monaco, while others might argue that, although his record with Spurs – where he was behind the decisions to take Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Toby Alderweireld to the club – was excellent, his record at Monaco has not quite left him above criticism. And as ever with Manchester United, all of this raises as many questions as it answers. If Murtough and Fletcher are now running the club’s recruitment, where would Mitchell fit into the equation? If Darren Fletcher is a ‘technical director’, then what is he doing in the dugout on a Saturday afternoon? What exactly is his role? Because even his own attempts to clarify it haven’t exactly sounded convincing. But those questions will keep coming. How do Manchester United plan to attract the elite-level players to which they believe themselves to be entitled if they can’t offer Champions League football? Where does Ralf Rangnick fit into all of this, especially considering that he will now be mixing his consultancy duties with being the head coach of the Austrian national team? Can any new structure or head coach change the culture of leaking to the press which has been relentless this season from a hopelessly factionalised dressing room? And ultimately, will Joel Glazer still be having the final say on all of these changes? Time is of the essence.It’s not that long until the end of the season and the reopening of the transfer window, and few would argue that Manchester United’s squad doesn’t need major work. Somewhere in this thicket of names there may be a combination that works, but while the departure of Matt Judge was necessary (if anything, it’s surprising that he stayed beyond the departure of Woodward), it doesn’t add much to the club ahead of what is likely to be an extremely busy summer. For many Manchester United supporters, the likely truth remains that the club cannot be truly reformed until the Glazer family have left. But with that looking no more likely now than at any other time over the last 17 years, supporters are left hoping against logic that this time the leopards running their clubs might finally change their spots. The post-Ferguson transition is now completing its ninth year without the club’s fortunes having substantially changed, and promises that this time things will definitely be different should probably be taken with a pinch of salt.

It was reported last month that Arsenal are among the Premier League teams interested in Gakpo. He is valued at around€40m by PSV. Liverpool ‘chaos’; Spurs awarded Arsenal’s transfer trophy The 22-year-old has been in fantastic form for the Dutch side this season. He has grabbed nine goals and 13 assists in the league from his 21 games. Gakpo made his senior debut for the Netherlands last year and he has now been capped four times. The winger is expected to leave PSV this summer. He has revealed that he wants to play in the Premier League: “The Premier League is a big league. Virgil van Dijk plays there with Liverpool so I like to watch them,” Gakpo told The Sun. “We are not the same kind of league but I think we try to look at the Premier League and learn about it. Everybody wants to play one time in the Premier League. I don’t favour one team but I like Arsenal a lot. “I looked up to Henry when I was younger because he was a tall guy who played on the wing.” Elsewhere,Unai Emery says “noise” is the big difference between managing Villarreal and his previous clubs, Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain. “The budget is important to have the best players but there are things that you can overcome with hard work. You have to create something else as a team, create a mentality and look for the details in the preparation. “Against a team that is normally better, we will be dominated for seventy or eighty minutes but there will remain 15 or 20% of the match during which you will have chances and that is what we will work on. “I impose the same demands on myself here as in Seville, at PSG or Arsenal. What changes here is that there is less ‘noise’ outside! At the same time, the noise, if you go out, you will hear it. “If you don’t go out, you don’t hear it.

He was here last year and if anything the intrigue has only grown. He has now had three hugely successful years as an Arsenal player; he just hasn’t spent any of them at Arsenal. Loans at St Etienne, Nice and now Marseille have even earned him his first caps for France. Friendly caps might not seem all that big a deal, but winning a cap for France as a centre-back is just about the toughest task in the entire sport; Aymeric Laporte found it so difficult he had to become Spanish instead; Ibrahima Konate still hasn’t managed it. Saliba, the man apparently surplus to requirements at Arsenal, has done it. He is understandably happy and settled at Marseille, where he plays every game, and a return to Arsenal would mean fighting for a place with Gabriel and Ben White. A lot depends on the player, but with only two years left on the five-year contract Saliba signed as a teenager, Arsenal are now very much at the point where it’s time to sh*t or get off the pot.  Aston Villa: Matt Targett One of many players currently on loan – along with Keinan Davis, Trezeguet, Anwar El Ghazi and Frederic Guilbert – who Villa are seemingly happy to move on permanently in the summer. Targett is key, because it appears relatively straightforward to do a deal with Newcastle that suits all parties while also bringing in a reasonably sizeable transfer fee – something in the order of £15m has been mooted – to help bankroll Steven Gerrard’s ambitious summer masterplan of spending £60m on Kalvin Phillips.  Brentford: Marcus Forss The Finland striker was in the squad for every one of Brentford’s first 23 Premier League games. But he started just one of those, getting off the bench in just six others and never for more than 30-odd minutes. He scored no goals. He went back to the Championship on loan with Hull in January and has managed just a single goal in eight appearances for the Tigers. He’s still got four years left on his Brentford contract; it’s hard to see how he can be part of what will almost certainly again be a Premier League squad next year, but you can also see why he’d be reluctant to leave the security of that long-term contract. Another loan?  Brighton: Kjell Scherpen The Seagulls have 13 players out on loan like some kind of petrodollar superclub. At least one of these will definitely be in the squad next season, surely – striker Deniz Undav who has scored only one league goal fewer for shock Belgian league title contenders Union Saint Gilloise before and after a January sale-and-return move than his new Brighton team-mates have managed to put together in the Premier League. A more interesting one might be giant back-up keeper Scherpen, who might have been doing a more important off-field role in the first half of the season than many realised. Scherpen spent the first half of the season watching Robert Sanchez be very good indeed and is now on loan while Sanchez makes repeated bollocks of things as Brighton’s season threatens to end with the sort of whimper that can have alarming knock-on effects the following year if not addressed. Even if he doesn’t play a single game, Scherpen might be worth keeping around the place.  Burnley: Bailey Peacock-Farrell We’re not spoiled for choice here. It’s a third-choice goalkeeper or a fourth-choice goalkeeper. Let’s go with Peacock-Farrell who is doing a decent enough job in nets for fallen giants Sheffield Wednesday as they look to clamber out of League One. Our main observation is that it doesn’t matter how many games of football he plays or at what level. No matter how high his career goes we will never, ever, ever accept that Bailey Peacock-Farrell is not in fact the name of a rugby player who, after six successful years in Super League, crosses codes to join Bath or whatever and make eight appearances for England in the 15-man game.  Chelsea: Conor Gallagher There is not a single Chelsea player currently on loan at Vitesse, which is perhaps why the whole world currently seems to be desperately trying to spin itself off its axis. It’s just not right or normal, is it? Chelsea do, though, have about a million players out on loan as is customary. Now the whole global unpleasantness is of particular relevance to Chelsea, who may not in fact have any choice to make over who stays or goes or heads out on loan. They may not even exist next season. Probably they will, though. And probably they will get to decide these things. Which means a decision to make on Gallagher, who has been one of the most exciting and enjoyable players in the Premier League this season. We’re big fans of players who get to that level and still seem to visibly enjoy playing the game. Palace would, clearly, dearly love to keep him and you do get a keen sense that this is now someone who needs to be playing regularly. You can’t keep him on the bench, released only for the odd runaround in a Carabao or non-vital European game. He’s tasted regular top-level football now and found it entirely to his liking. At the very least, you’d think he needs to spend another year on loan playing all the football.  Crystal Palace: Luke Plange Palace only have two players currently out on loan and it’s fair to say their summer thoughts might be rather more exercised by what happens next to the player they currently have on loan (see above). Anyway, the two options are a) 23-year-old American Jacob Montes who has spent the entirety of his slightly odd one-year Palace contract pulling up no trees in a pair of half-season loans in the Belgian second division and therefore b) Luke Plange, the teenager whose breakthrough at Derby convinced Palace to make a buy-and-return move in January. Palace have a bit of form for developing Football League talent into Premier League players, but you’d imagine that’s probably a way off yet. A good Championship loan seems the likeliest option next season.  Everton: Moise Kean In theory, he’s still in the first year of a two-year loan at Juventus with an obligation to buy at the end of it. In theory. In reality, Juventus weren’t right sure a while ago and since signing Dusan Vlahovic are less convinced still about the merits of Kean who has scored just four goals in 24 Serie A games this season. All the noise suggests Juventus are looking to get out of the current arrangement and send Kean back to Goodison this summer, an outcome that we have to imagine absolutely nobody else involved wants. So whatever happens next it should be fun to see what comes of it all.  Leeds: Helder Costa In and out of the side at Valencia but has made no secret of the fact he’s happier in Spain and would like to make his move permanent if everyone else is up for it. They probably will be. “I feel better here, I came from a not so good situation (at Leeds). But Valencia have given me the opportunity to relaunch my career and I think this is the ideal place to do that,” Costa toldSuper Sport last year.   Leicester City: Dennis Praet A victim of the Dreaded Metatarsal, which has kept him out of the Torino side for a couple of months at a frustrating time and appears likely now to be a season-ender. The Belgian is apparently happy in Turin and keen to stay, but the Italian side seem keen to use his injury as a means to drive down the agreed £12.5m option price in the current loan arrangement. Reports from the Italian end suggest Torino might favour another loan over an outright purchase but, with just two year left on his Leicester contract, you’d imagine the Foxes would want something more concrete built into that. An obligation that kicks in once a set number of appearances is reached or some such thing. We don’t know. We’re not contract negotiators.  Liverpool: Nathaniel Phillips It’s between Phillips and Neco Williams here. Both will still have three years left on their contracts in the summer. Both are on loan at high-flying Championship clubs. Both have obvious talent. Both face significant top-quality barriers to their first-team progression at Anfield. But it’s Phillips, five years Williams’ senior, for whom the clock is more conspicuously ticking. Phillips did an admirable job in that desperate half-season for Liverpool last year when all their other centre-backs fell over, but is that situation going to present itself again? Should Bournemouth confirm promotion back to the Premier League, and that appears almost certain now given their sizeable cushion in both points and games in hand over third-placed Luton, you’d imagine both player and club might be keen on a more permanent arrangement. Ticklish thing there is that longish contract, half a season of decent Premier League football behind him and apparent absence of any option in his loan contract. What would Liverpool want for him? £15m is a number that has been touted, and if anything you’d be surprised if it was that low really.  Manchester City: Pedro Porro Just the 13 City players currently plying their trade elsewhere at the mo. Spain right-back Porro is perhaps the most interesting of those, currently in the second half of a successful two-year stint in Lisbon with Sporting that has already brought one league title and could yet bring another if a six-point gap to Porto can be overturned. Eight goals and nine assists from 65 games played predominantly at right wing-back are eye-catching numbers.  Manchester United: Donny van de Beek The arrival of a new manager in the summer means all things are a bit up in the air for United’s current loanees, who could suddenly find themselves far more in favour when a new man arrives. We suspect minds have been made up now, though, about Anthony Martial. Van de Beek is an intriguing one, though. Especially if United’s new manager does turn out to be his former Ajax gaffer Erik Ten Hag in spite of Louis van Gaal’s mischief-making. Van de Beek is clearly a talent, but whether he can crack it here remains in some doubt. What is not is that he is yet to be presented with an environment to categorically prove it one way or the other. In hindsight – and, if we’re honest, foresight – packing him off to Frank Lampard’s Everton Circus might not have been a brilliant idea. We’re still really none the wiser about him.  Newcastle: Freddie Woodman If you were loaned out by Newcastle in January then really it’s a pretty clear hint about where your future lies. For Woodman, who played four Premier League games at the start of the season, it’s meant sitting on the bench for promotion-chasing Bournemouth as back-up to Mark Travers. It is the seventh loan of his Newcastle career, and he has one year left on his contract at St James’ Park. At 25, it’s surely time for a permanent move to go and be first choice somewhere even if it means dropping down a tier or two.  Norwich: Todd Cantwell Like Norwich themselves, he’s pretty good at getting into the Premier League but not so good at staying there. With his current loan club Bournemouth set to once again swap divisions with parent club Norwich, the logical conclusion is surely for Cantwell to go back to Norwich and complete what would be the genuinely novel achievement of a third successive promotion from the Championship. Bournemouth do, though, hold the option of making the move permanent and spoiling everything.  Southampton: Dan N’Lundulu Because there is literally nobody else other than a 23-year-old striker who scored two goals in 20 League One appearances across a pair of loans at first Lincoln and then Cheltenham before suffering a season-ending hamstring injury.  Tottenham: Bryan Gil Spurs have seven players out on loan, and with most of them the future looks pretty clear one way or the other. It would be a major surprise were Tanguy Ndombele or Giovani Lo Celso to have futures in north London, which is a shame but also probably for the best. Neither has been missed since January. Jack Clarke was Spurs’ attempt at a moneyball signing and it’s not worked out. Cameron Carter-Vickers is likely to make his loan move to Celtic permanent. Pape Sarr, the teenage midfield sensation bought from and loaned straight back to Metz last summer, will require a decision but not a final one. The suspicion there is that he’ll spend pre-season with Spurs before either being brought into the first-team squad or sent on another loan. Spurs, you’d imagine, would prefer that to be to either a bottom-half Premier League club or ambitious Championship side (let’s face it, it will probably be Norwich) to find out how he goes in English football. But the big decision probably regards Bryan Gil, the skilful yet painfully lightweight Spanish winger who just looked nowhere near the right sort of fit for English football. His current loan in Spain cannot tell us much but he is the one player on the Spurs list where all things are possible. This time next year he could just as easily be a Spurs first-team regular, starring for Valencia in La Liga having joined on a permanent basis, doing bits for Crystal Palace on loan or languishing at Tottenham having subsisted on the occasional Europa night which is no longer an option because Spurs have found some new and absurdly Spursy way to get knocked out. Watford: Philip Zinckernagel The Hornets look to be on to a good thing whatever happens here thanks to Zinckernagel’s Nottingham Forest exploits. He’s scored five goals and laid on nine assists to help Forest into the play-off picture, but it’s his eye-catching displays in Forest’s fabulous FA Cup run that really make you take notice. If Watford stay up, then he has shown he can play at Premier League level. If they go down, then he has shown he can propel a Championship promotion bid. And if Watford go down and Forest go up, then they might be able to sell him for a nice price. Win, win, win. If you ignore the whole ‘relegation’ stuff, which is not a win and frankly a bit of a downer.  West Ham: Conor Coventry Because he’s the only West Ham player currently out on loan. They really don’t have a very big squad. The 22-year-old spent the first half of this season in the lower reaches of the Championship, making 12 appearances – mainly off the bench – for Peterborough, and is now in League One with MK Dons. Has just a year left on his contract at West Ham, for whom he has made three brief appearances off the bench in the League Cup.  Wolves: Adama Traore All appeared sorted when he set off to Barcelona initially on loan with a £29m option to make it permanent in the summer. Four assists in 10 games have gone some way to confirming the suspicion that his end-product stats might improve away from Wolves but there is yet a fly in the ointment thanks to Barcelona’s much-publicised financial problems making that £29m a bit steep for them. Wolves have made it clear that Traore is done at Molineux unless there’s a surprise U-turn on a new contract and even then Wolves may feel he’s burned his bridges. Spurs were keen in January, but might have moved on now. Could get tricky, this. ",positive,spurs,9

He has played more than 150 times for Milan over the past four seasons. Ranking Spurs players by where they sit on Conte’s sh*tlist De Vrij played under Conte at Inter Milan. Together they helped the club win the Serie A title in 2020/21. Conte has been Tottenham boss since November. In January, he raided Juventus as the Londoners signedRodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski. On De Vrij, InterLive (via Sport Witness) have suggested that Milan ‘could lose one of their pillars’ this summer. Tottenham are interested in the Dutchman at the ‘request of Conte’. The 30-year-old would be offered a four-year deal that is worth around€6.5m each season. The report adds that Inter Milan will ‘close the deal’ this summer if they receive a bid in the region of€25-30m for De Vrij. Elsewhere, Conte has insisted that he has the patience to see the job through at Tottenham after they were dumped out of the FA Cup at Middlesbrough.

https://www.football365.com/news/tottenham-add-potter-mancini-shortlist-pochettino-doubts-conte-future,Tottenham add two managers to their shortlist as doubts grow over Conte’s future,"Tottenham have added Graham Potter and Roberto Mancini to their list of possible alternatives to Mauricio Pochettino as doubts grow over Antonio Conte’s future at the club, according to reports. Spurs have been improving since Conte took over in early November to replace Nuno Espirito Santo, who lost five of his last seven Premier League matches to leave the club ninth in the table. Since then, Tottenham have gradually risen up the table and now find themselves fifth, two points off fourth-placed Arsenal with five matches to play. Champions League ‘festival of football’ plans are yet another affront to supporters Spurs have the Gunners to play in the north London derby in a fortnight’s time with the match probably going a long way to deciding which of the two teams will play Champions League football next season. However, there have been rumours that Conte could jump ship this summer whatever happens in the final straight with a report insisting that the Italian has offered himself to Paris Saint-Germain. Pochettino is almost certain to leave this summer, with the manager and PSG attempting to agree a compensation package which would allow him to depart, as the French giants would have to fork out€15m to sack him. The report on Monday claimed that there has also been ‘contact’ between Pochettino and Daniel Levy with the Tottenham chairman ‘trying to convince the coach to return to Spurs’. And now the Daily Mail say that Tottenham are ‘looking at alternatives’ to Pochettino if Conte attempts to exit this summer ‘withGraham Potterand Roberto Mancini among the names set to be considered’. It is understood that Pochettino is ‘largely viewed as the ideal candidate to replace the Italian’ but ‘there is some opposition from within the Tottenham hierarchy’ to his potential return. That ‘resistance has led the club to explore other avenues’ with Potter and Mancini emerging as possible options. Brighton manager Potter was linked with a move to Spurs in the summer when Nuno was appointed and just before Conte’s arrival in north London. The Daily Mail adds that Tottenham have ‘long admired the work Potter has accomplished at Brighton and will be on the club’s radar if they find themselves trying to replace Conte this summer’. Mancini, who is currently manager of the Italian national team, is also ‘an option’ with Spurs’ managing director of football Fabio Paratici ‘an admirer’ of the former Manchester City boss. The Daily Mail adds: ‘It’s important to stress that Tottenham’s due diligence towards the appointment of Conte’s successor remains a matter of contingency preparation, with sources indicating succession planning at football clubs is completely normal. ‘Indeed, Tottenham’s plan A is for Conte to stay in charge heading into next season – and there is a feeling behind the scenes that he will not walk away.’ ",positive,spurs,5

The Italian was desperate for reinforcements last month at Tottenham but, after the club missed out on deals for Adama Traoreand Luis Diaz, they only brought in Juventus pair Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur on deadline day. On the same day Conte saw the club’s two most expensive players – Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso – leave on loan, with Dele Alli joining Everton on a free transfer and Bryan Gil going to Valencia less than six months after his £25m arrival from Sevilla. Premier League winners and losers A report has claimed that Harry Kane will only commit his future to Spurs if they back Conte in the transfer market and now Italian website Inter Live reckon they will do just that by trying to sign Inter Milan duoLautaro Martinez and Stefan de Vrij. Tottenham had lost three Premier League matches in a row before their dramatic late 3-2 victory over champions Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Their poor form and lack of activity in the January market seemed to have demoralised Conte in recent interviews but they bounced back to maintain the seven-point gap to fourth-placed Manchester United, who they have three games in hand on. And Inter Live insist that Conte now ‘expects signings of players ready to win’ in the summer transfer window if he is to remain as boss beyond the summer and De Vrij and Martinez tick those boxes. Conte won the Serie A title last season with the duo key cogs in his winning team and now it is claimed that Spurs are prepared to pay€90-100m in a double swoop for the Inter pair. However, it is understood that Tottenham would fall around €20m short of their valuation as the Nerazzurri ‘would ask for €110-120m for both of them’. Inter Live describe it as a ‘difficult operation’ for Spurs but that landing De Vrij and Martinez ‘would make the discontented Conte happy’. ",positive,spurs,4

Meanwhile, Ralf Rangnick could return to Leipzig for a midfielder… LIVERPOOL KEEN ON CRANKY CAMAVINGA Eduardo Camavinga only joined Real Madrid in the summer, when Manchester United were thought to be interested in the France midfielder. But having struggled to secure a place in Carlo Ancelotti’s first XI, there is already talk of the teenager looking for another move. Camavinga has managed only six starts in all competitions for Real this season, which has prompted El Nacional to link him to Liverpool. Apparently, the 19-year-old ‘has a monumental rage’ over his situation at Real and is open to loan or permanent offers, and Jurgen Klopp is still keen to take the former Rennes star. Having done a deal to sign Camavinga in the summer which could cost them up to £35million, Real are said to want a profit on the midfielder.  Top 10 Under-21 Premier League stars of 2021  RANGNICK RETURNS TO LEIPZIG FOR MIDFIELDER United are also looking for midfielders, though not with replacing Paul Pogba in mind. Fabrizio Romano says the Red Devils’ renewal offer to Pogba is still on the table, where it has been since the summer. There are no negotiations with other clubs over a possible January sale, while Pogba is still said to be assessing his options. Indeed, the Mirror reports that if Pogba wants to leave United next month, he will have to push for a move. But Ralf Rangnick is still exploring the market for midfielders and the Mirror reckons the United boss could make contact with former club RB Leipzig to discuss a deal for Amadou Haidara.

De Vrij is entering the final 18 months of his contract at the San Siro, where he played for Conte before the manager moved on. The Sun rehashes a report from Swiss website 4-4-2.com that suggests Spurs are keen on Matthijs De Ligt – but they won’t pay the ridiculous release clause that comes into play next summer. De Ligt could leave Juventus for around £130million at the end of the season, with Barcelona and Chelsea interested. But those clubs too would also be looking to negotiate on that figure.

https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-premier-league-winners-losers-everton-zaha-arteta-norwich-marsch,"Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature","Everton will do well to remember that ritual again this season. Wilfried Zaha gets praise but Norwich, Watford and Jesse Marsch do not. Winners Everton Any Everton supporter with a proclivity for ritualisation might find these last few weeks of the season particularly taxing. It is basic human nature to superstitiously recreate certain behaviours and practices – wearing a supposedly ‘lucky’ item of clothing or following a specific morning routine – in the hope of capturing that same positive energy. Fans might not be able to control what the players do, but if setting off early morning fireworks outside the opposition hotel, carrying an incredibly tranquil dog aloft through a raucous crowd, noisily welcoming the team bus, playing a game of catch with Richarlison and a flare and hiding the match ball up your jumper during stoppage time preceded a crucial victory over the reigning world and European champions, it might be worth trying again for the last five fixtures. Everton will be petrified of changing anything, considering how long it has taken to stumble upon a formula that works. After three wins and a draw in their opening four games, the longest unbeaten run the Toffees have been on in the Premier League this season is two matches. That surely has to change at some point before the end of the campaign for them to survive. But after watching that gap to safety extend to five points before kick-off on Sunday, Everton finally produced under pressure against Chelsea. It was a dogged, determined performance typified by Jordan Pickford’s brilliance, Yerry Mina’s snide and the industry of Demarai Gray and Richarlison, who combined for the winner. The only negative is that Frank Lampard’s side have two fixtures remaining at Goodison Park in comparison to three more trips away. Stock up on sparklers, prepare the calm canines and wear the baggiest clothes possible for that four-day period in which Brentford and Crystal Palace visit Merseyside, because Everton are 10th in a home table – and bottom, at least three points behind every other team in an away one – for a reason. Everton substance over style earns Lampard huge Chelsea scalp in relegation dogfight  BurnleyWhile there were 5,787 days between the amassing of Michael Jackson’s seven UK number ones, the accrual of ten Premier League points has taken Mike Jackson barely a fortnight. Burnley have won three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since April 2019. That same sequence of results – 2-0 against Wolves, 1-3 at Bournemouth and 2-0 against Cardiff – just so happens to contain the previous instance of the Clarets coming from behind to win away in the league. An Ashley Barnes own goal gifted Eddie Howe’s Cherries a fourth-minute lead but the striker rounded off the scoring early in the second half to complete a fine recovery. Three years later, James Tarkowski handed Watford the advantage after eight minutes by accidentally rebounding a shot into his own net. Barnes was central to their revival again, an inspired substitute for Wout Weghorst with half an hour remaining. It changed the angle and method of attack and Watford could not sustain the pressure. This unorthodox caretaker reign has reignited a fading survival bid but also reinvigorated a squad which looked quietly fractured and bereft. The Clarets have scored six goals in four games since Sean Dyche’s departure, each from different players in Wout Weghorst, Connor Roberts, Nathan Collins, Matej Vydra and now the unlikeliest double act of Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill. That the result effectively relegated Watford, barring a miracle, could have a further uplifting effect on one of the most tightly-knit squads around; seeing the pain of the drop first-hand sharpens the collective focus to avoid it. Burnley are finally on course to do just that. Michael Jackson has only been in charge of Burnley since 15 April and already has more Premier League points (10) than any Watford manager has taken this season (Munoz 7, Ranieri 6, Hodgson 9). — Richard Jolly 🇺🇦 (@RichJolly) May 1, 2022   Wilfried Zaha and Patrick VieiraThe situation could hardly have been managed any better. Patrick Vieira noted that Leeds wanted to have their cake and eat it, targeting Wilfried Zaha and fouling him four times before Kalvin Phillips tarred the Crystal Palace forward with a familiar brush.“For someone who dives so much, he has an awful lot of bruises on his ankles,” his manager said, explaining why Zaha started on the bench against Southampton. There was a time when that would have been an automatic signal of defeat for Palace. Zaha was their talisman, without whom they had little hope of operating functionally. He remains integral but this is a solid side that is adorned by his brilliance, rather than solely reliant upon it. Four minutes after Eberechi Eze’s equaliser against Southampton, Vieira threw Zaha on for the final half an hour with the express intention of occupying the home defence as a centre-forward – “We put him in the No.9 because of his mobility and the fact he can hold the ball and run in-behind” – and the results were resounding. Southampton are Zaha’s most frequent opponent. He has faced them 20 times. But his last few visits to St Mary’s had ranged from forgettable to a frustrating exhibition of his main weakness. The 29-year-old constantly toes the line and while he crossed the wrong side in rising to the provocation of James Ward-Prowse and being sent off in February 2019, Zaha somehow resisted the temptation to celebrate in the Southampton midfielder’s face upon his sublime stoppage-time winner. This is already the highest-scoring season of his career and it is no coincidence that he no longer feels the burden of constantly having to drag Palace up to his level. Vieira has built a team worthy of their crown jewel.  Jurgen KloppFive changes from midweek delivered a fifth 1-0 win of the Premier League season for Liverpool. The nature of those victories sum up Jurgen Klopp’s impeccable squad management, with each delivered by a different scorer: Naby Keita against Newcastle; Sadio Mane against West Ham in March; Fabinho against Burnley in February; Mo Salah against Aston Villa in December; and Divock Origi against Wolves the prior week. Extend it to all competitions and a sixth 1-0 win came from Diogo Jota’s effort against Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup quarter-finals. It is an enduring testament to both their strength in depth and of character.  RodriOne of the key fulcrums behind Manchester City’s unexpected set-piece dominance has been Rodri. They look far tighter defending free-kicks and corners with the midfielder in place, and much more threatening attacking them with him lurking. Perhaps behind only Ederson, it feels like Rodri is the player Pep Guardiola staked his reputation on the most. For a holding midfielder, his defensive instincts were initially poor and that counter-pressing role often proved beyond his capabilities and speed. There were few more polarising Manchester City players at one point: some saw enough to suggest he could eventually provide the necessary foundation for success, while others feared that dominance of the English game might always be just out of Rodri’s reach. He epitomises Guardiola’s reign in that way, by rising above preconceptions and changing the game to his whim instead of the other way around. His teammates have stood out at certain points, but Rodri has been a model of consistency.  Brighton’s scoutsMarc Cucurella was outstanding. Yves Bissouma was excellent. Moises Caicedo looks like an absolute Premier League natural. Enock Mwepu’s versatility has been a welcome addition to his game. Leandro Trossard has that air of a player who could raise his levels to suit the standard of most teams. Robert Sanchez matched his tally of clean sheets from last season. Those six players were signed for combined fees equivalent to the sales of Benjamin White, Anthony Knockaert and Aaron Mooy over the last two years. It is a neat party trick to master, particularly as it does not rely upon a specific manager, although the influence of an excellent coach undeniably helps the process. “We sold Ben and we’ve managed to improve. That’s the challenge in the Premier League for teams like us.It’s impossible to think you can keep hold of everybody. But we can sell at the right time, at the right price, then carry on trying to improve,” was Graham Potter’s message after the win over Wolves. Acknowledging that role in football’s food chain is important; embracing it is crucial. Marc Cucurella is unbelievably good every time I watch Brighton. So technically proficient on the ball, rounded defensive game, and can run the whole flank for the full 90 — Aaron Moniz (@amonizfootball) April 30, 2022   Cristian RomeroPatson Daka was theamuse-bouche that only intensified Cristian Romero’s appetite for his main course of Turkish affright. The halfway second challenge that directly preceded Heung-min Son’s first goal did not resemble a halfway line clash between hardened centre-halves, only because Caglar Soyuncu was entirely consumed by his counterpart. It was a comprehensive clattering. Tottenham would rise to fourth only temporarily, but even if they do eventually miss out on the Champions League there is solace in Romero’s presence. “The difficulty is, what top players are going to go to Spurs?” Roy Keane asked in January, suggesting that qualification for Europe’s premier competition was a prerequisite for attracting the best talent. Romero disproves that  Mikel ArtetaArsenal are another step closer to the ultimate justification. By the close of the January transfer window, Rob Holding had started four Premier League games and Mo Elneny just one. Eddie Nketiah’s only appearances outside of the League Cup by then had lasted no more than 19 minutes off the bench. Yet Mikel Arteta trusted all three to deliver when the inescapable time came that he had to call upon them. The Spaniard will be mocked and criticised by many onlookers but harnessing that sort of squad harmony is a delicate balancing act that only the two coaches competing for the title have managed better. The excellence of youth has underpinned this Arsenal season – Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli assisting the goals was apropos – but this is far more of a team effort than it ever has been a case of individualism.   Losers NorwichThere are deeper reads to be had on Norwich’s demise, but describing it as inevitable is misleading. In this particular season they had every chance of avoiding relegation, armed with a solid budget and the painful lessons of previous failures, with hindsight showing that other clubs could have been pulled further into danger. They should have had every advantage on Brentford, for example, yet 19 points separate the reigning second-tier champions from last season’s play-off winners. The sale of Emiliano Buendia was both predictable and early, yet the Canaries used neither the windfall nor the time nearly well enough. Most importantly, there was once an understanding and acceptance from the supporters, who long put their faith in the project and were sold The Norwich Way as the only way. That self-funded model has felt like a pre-prepared excuse all season. Other clubs have navigated those financial constraints much more convincingly. And unless the culture indelibly changes, even promotion next campaign will come with an undercurrent of trepidation from three successive top-flight relegations. Stuart Webber and his time have a few mountains to climb, not least in terms of getting supporters back onside.  Watford The feeling at Vicarage Road will be similar, albeit their fate has not been officially confirmed and the route by which it will surely be reached is vastly different. There have at least been suggestions that Watford intend on changing their ways by arming a younger manager with time and patience instead of whittling down the never-ending list of names on the combined Pozzo-Duxbury contacts book. But the jury will not expect to reconvene on that anytime soon. The next challenge will be to retain certain portions of the squad, because for all their flaws this is not a team which should be setting records for consecutive top-flight home defeats. Ismaila Sarr, Joao Pedro and Emmanuel Dennis are among those who have been gradually dragged down by an atrocious defence, despite the opposite being true last season when Xisco Munoz built upon a solid backline to gain promotion. There should be more optimism at Watford than Norwich, even if the Roy Hodgson appointment has been an unmitigated disaster for all involved. But Duxbury in particular will have questions to answer, considering he spent last May painstakingly listing all the mistakes the Hornets had learned from ahead of this season. Same again. Imagine being a #WatfordFC sub today and your manager not believing in you enough to bring you on. I hope for Duxbury’s sake the club aren’t relying on any of those subs for next year. — Rob Ezekiel (@Rob_Ezekiel) April 30, 2022   Jesse MarschIt was notable that Frank Lampard and Jesse Marsch echoed similar lines. The former described Everton’s fans as “the 12th man” and thanked them for helping “get us over the line late in the game”. The latter said that “the best part was the fans’ response” and “there was so much passion and love for the team from the fans”. The Leeds manager did stress that “that isn’t pandering to our fans” but it is a tough balance to strike. He and Lampard have both perhaps visited that well a little too often. But the key difference there is that Everton fans – rightly or wrong – welcomed their boss as the replacement for an unpopular figurehead, while Marsch started at a natural disadvantage due to the nature of Marcelo Bielsa’s relationship with the support. Few could blame him for leaning on that aspect of a 4-0 defeat in which Leeds had their chances. And in truth, they are losers mainly because of the worst possible results elsewhere. That five-game unbeaten run immediately before the Manchester City loss is keeping heads barely above water and a run-in of Arsenal, Chelsea, Brighton and Brentford has its pros and cons. Pandering or otherwise, Marsch and his players will need the fans to be in full voice.  ChelseaJose Mourinho, in combination with Steven Gerrard, successfully tricked the world into forgetting Chelsea led the Premier League table as late as April 2014; it was not only Liverpool who capitulated in that title race. On a far lesser scale, Thomas Tuchel might be accompanying his players on a slow slide down this table. The German ought to be thankful that the league season is both over soon, and will require Arsenal to face Tottenham in its penultimate week. Chelsea sit three points ahead of Arsenal and five above Spurs, all having played the same number of games. But only two of those sides have momentum currently in their favour. The Blues are finding it difficult to generate that and after a run of five consecutive Premier League wins, their form has been: L, W, L, W, D, L. Tuchel increasingly looks incapable of rousing them from this slump and preventing the individual mistakes that continue to undermine any hint of progress. The season could yet end with Wembley glory and Tuchel’s strength at Stamford Bridge thus far has been in managing those one-off games. But his reign will ultimately be measured by Premier League progress and that is a nut he still seems unable to crack.  WolvesThat unavoidable sense of flux has returned. Bruno Lage has completed a hat-trick of three successive Premier League defeats. Wolves emerged from that stuttering August start to establish their Champions League credentials, which were firmly ended by losses to Arsenal, West Ham and Crystal Palace in March. That cushion to 9th and below should be substantial enough to prevent goalless setbacks against Newcastle, Burnley and Brighton doing lasting damage, but it is demoralising for a season that promised so much to deliver so little.  The European semi-finalistsConsidering how delicately those Europa League and Europa Conference League semi-finals are poised, West Ham and Leicester’s respective seasons hang in the balance. Both are without a win in their last four Premier League games, starting from the match after their quarter-final second-leg heroics and bleeding into the final matches of their semi-finals. If either progress then that drop-off will be forgotten but it will be difficult to gather anything tangible from the season if they are knocked out in midweek.  SouthamptonA ludicrous football club. Between December 15 and February 25, Southampton went on a run of one defeat in 10 Premier League games. From March 5 to April 30, that has become a sequence of one win in nine. ",positive,spurs,2
https://www.football365.com/news/tottenham-told-target-world-class-ex-arsenal-man-bayern-munich-gnabry,Tottenham told to target ‘world-class’ ex-Arsenal man – ‘that level of player is what you want’,"Ex-Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Paul Robinson has urged his former club to sign Bayern Munich and Germany star Serge Gnabry. The 26-year-old signed for Arsenal in 2011 when he was 16-years-old. He was unable to establish himself as a regular for the Gunners. Gnabry only played for them 18 times and he had an unsuccessful loan spell at West Brom during the 2015/16 season. Spurs settle another set of jitters with a masterclass from Son Heung-min The attacker left Arsenal in 2016 to join Werder Bremen on a permanent basis.Following an impressive debut season, Bayern Munich activated his release clause to sign him. The Germany international has been a key player for Bayern Munich in recent seasons. He has grabbed 63 goals and 40 assists from his 169 outings across all competitions. So far this term, he has been involved in 26 goals from his 43 appearances. His future at Bayern is in doubt as his contract expires in 2023. It was reported last week that Gnabry has rejected Bayern’s latest contract offer. If he signed the deal, his salary would have doubled. Robinson thinks Tottenham should be “in the hunt” to sign Gnabry this summer: “Gnabry is a world-class player,” Robinson told Football Insider. “If he is to leave Bayern Munich you would like to think that Spurs are in the hunt for him. “It is going to be a big summer for Spurs. A lot will depend on whether Harry Kane stays at the club, which I hope he does. “I’d question whether Gnabry would get into the Tottenham team ahead of Son, Kane and Kulusevski right now. He’d be competition for Kulusevski but I don’t think that position is a priority at the moment. “That level of player is what you want Spurs to be signing though.” Elsewhere, ex-France international Jerome Rothen has warned PSG against pursuing Antonio Conte because he’s “more passionate about his chequebook” than Spurs. Reports emerged last week linking Conte with a move to PSG with the French club apparently set to move on Mauricio Pochettino at the end of the season. Conte has a reputation for short stints in jobs, while there have been rumours that the Spurs boss wants a £30m wage package to take over at the French giants and former PSG winger Rothen thinks he’s the wrong man for the job. “Of course not. When you hear these demands, stay where you are. Certainly don’t come to a club like PSG, who need to improve their image, one far more healthy. “You need people who are passionate about football, and I’m not saying Conte isn’t, but he seems more passionate about his chequebook than managing Tottenham, PSG or another team. That’s already problematic.” ",positive,spurs,6

United host Brentford on Monday night. Owen has called for Rangnick to give the club’s youngsters some game time against the Bees: “Now United have little to play for, I’m curious whether Ralf Rangnick will change the personnel,” (quotes via The Express). “There’s a lot of promising youngsters at the club, now would be an ideal opportunity for them to get some game time ahead of the new boss coming in this summer. “Brentford have had such a great season and can travel to Old Trafford full of confidence after that draw against Spurs. They’ve been very organised in recent weeks, and make it difficult for each side they face. “I’m still going to pick United. Brentford will be difficult to break down, I’m going for 1-0.” Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson has also made a prediction for Monday night’s clash at Old Trafford. The former Arsenal man thinks Man Utd and Brentford will draw 2-2. He believes this will be a “hard game” for the hosts: “Manchester United have more immediate concerns, however, and this’ll be a hard game for them,” Merson told Sportskeeda. “The way Brentford have been playing, they could pull this off. Who would’ve thought this was possible one, two, or ten years ago? “Brentford are going to go out there expecting to win this game.

They have responded in recent weeks though, with them picking up victories over Chelsea, Man Utd and West Ham. Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature Fifth-placed Tottenham are chasing them down. Antonio Conte’s side returned to winning ways on Sunday as they got the better of Leicester City. The rivals meet in a vital North London derby at The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium next week. O’Hara has made an early prediction for the derby. He thinks “you have to back Spurs” to win given that they are at home: “Arsenal will slip up. I think they’ve got tough games,” O’Hara told talkSPORT. “I think [Tottenham] have got one more tough game, and then it’s the North London Derby. That’s like a cup final which could go either way. “I just have to back Spurs, surely you have to back Spurs under the lights, at home, against Arsenal.” Ray Parlour then chimed in: “It’s quite funny you saying Arsenal will crumble, Spurs do it every year!” Meanwhile,Jamie Redknapp has praised Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta for his decision to give the captain’s armband to Martin Odegaard in recent weeks. “Xhaka was captain for a while, didn’t really work, [then] Aubameyang, then they give it to Lacazette. It was almost that no one wanted to be. “But giving it to Odegaard, it feels right for me. He may not be the most vocal but when you watch him play, he organises people, he plays the right pass. He’s a lovely player to watch. “You can see from Mikel Arteta’s point of view, he’s almost his manager on the pitch. It might be one where, he’s there for the future, he’s a fantastic player, good type of guy as well. It’s a masterstroke from Arteta.” ",positive,spurs,4
https://www.goal.com/en/news/noni-madueke-psv-english-teen-star-turned-down-man-utd/k46l9p2jgeep1h1sslkxcs4pc,Noni Madueke: PSV's English teen star who turned down Man Utd,"It is no secret that an increasingnumber of young British footballers are exploring opportunities overseas in a bid to earn first-team minutes atan earlier age. Jadon Sancho has proven trailblazer in this regard, inspiring a number of teenagers to follow the Borussia Dortmund starto the Bundesliga. However, Germany's top -flight is not the only league offering youngsters a chance to progress. In Eredivisie, for example, there is a young English talent aiming to make as big an impact at PSV this season as Sancho did during his breakout campaign atDortmund in 2018-19. That player is Noni Madueke. ""[Sancho] has opened the eyes to other talents,” the 18-year-old forward, who joined PSV from Tottenham in 2018,told Voetbal International. “A year after him, I went from Spurs to PSV. The plan that I had in mind then is now workingout the way I intended it. ""In England, it is very difficult as a young talent to get into the first team, especially at the bigger clubs. The squads are very large andthere is little room for youngsters. They often stay in reserve teams for a long time orare loaned out. ""There is little flow or chance to break through. That is completely different in the Netherlands."" Having taken his first steps into the senior ranks in Eindhoven before Covid-19 brought a premature end to the 2019-20 campaign, Madueke is now set to play a key role for the Dutch giants. Before making the switch from England to continental Europe, Madueke spent the entirety of his youth football career at Tottenham, where he captained the club's Under-16s as well as making his debut for the U18s as a 15-year-old. Having been named Player of the Tournament at the prestigious Sonnenland Cup in Germany in 2017, a number of top clubs began to take notice of his potential. Manchester United made an offer to take him north, while Chelsea and Celtic were also linked with his signature. But it was PSV who won the race, with Madueke keen to ensure he earned first-team football sooner rather than later. ""There are so many young players in first teams at the top levelat PSV orAjax,” Madueke told the Daily Mailof the Eredivisie a year on from his arrival in Eindhoven. ""Players like Frenkie de Jong andall of these guys. Skip skip skip 😌 A post shared by  Noni Tristan Madueke (@nonzinoo10) on Dec 23, 2019 at 10:01am PST ""I thought if I want to get to the first team as quickly as possible, then I have to move from Tottenham and come to PSV. ""As long as I keep doing the things they are telling me, I feel like I’ll reach that first-team level sooneras opposed to if I had stayed at Tottenham."" Despite the prospect of opportunities with the senior side, Madueke has had to work his way through ranks during his two years at PSV. Upon his arrival he was introduced into the U17s squad, but after scoring three goals in as many games in December 2018 he was handed a permanent promotion to the U19s, for whom he netted a further four goals that season. In 2019-20, he took his game to new levels, scoring seven goals and providing eight assists in just 11 appearances for the U19sduring the first half of the campaign. Such returns saw him rewarded with a promotion to the Jong PSV squad, who play in the Dutch second division. In six games, he scored four goals, and by early March he was again changing lockers after officially being named as part of the first-team squad. Having made three substitute appearances earlier in the campaign, Madueke's first senior start came against Groningen on March 8, though that turned out to be PSV's final game of the season before coronavirus forced football in the Netherlands to go into hiding. The England youth international played his part in a 1-0 win, and two days later signed a new contract which will keep him at the club until 2024, despite increased interest from Arsenal, Manchester City, RB Leipzig, Valencia and Wolves since the turn of the year. Done Deal! #2024 🙌🏾 A post shared by  Noni Tristan Madueke (@nonzinoo10) on Mar 10, 2020 at 10:07am PDT Blessed with speed, skill and physicality, Madueke has spent much of his young career playing as a winger or wide forward who cuts inside from the right to either score or create goals. However, new PSV boss Roger Schmidt has arrived at Philips Stadion with a plan to play 4-4-2, meaning if Madueke is to earn more opportunities he must now adapt his game so as to become a central striker. He made the perfect start during pre-season, netting a first-half hat-trick against lower-league SC Verle that included a stunning solo strike to secure him the match ball. ""I'm not surprised. He already scored a lot of goals in training. He feels comfortable up front and doesn't have to be a winger,"" Schmidt toldDe Telegraafafter Madueke's superb display of finishing. ""Noni's timing is often very good and he has a good feeling for free space. ""I'm also very happy with his mentality. He is a good fighterand is capable of reading the situation.""  Former PSV midfielder Tommie van de Leegte is excited by what Madueke can provide in his potential new role, telling Omroep Brabant: ""He's fast and has the capability to trick his opponent. He brings creativity and is very explosive in his actions. That's what PSV needs. ""Yes, he's young, but age doesn't matter to me. He has shown himself inpre-season, so I would give him the chance to prove himself in the big games as well."" Though Madueke was not included in Schmidt's starting line-up for PSV's Eredivisie opener against Groningen on Sunday, he certainly did prove himself after coming off the bench in the second half. The teenager provided two assists to help secure a 3-1 win, and it will surely not be long before he is earning regular starts just over two years since the biggest decision his young career. “I wanted to be in the first team as young as possible, at the age of 17or 18,"" Madueke said 12 months ago. ""At a club like Tottenham that is not feasible –you only come into the picture around the age of 20. ""That is why I chose PSV two years ago and what is happeningnow with all the opportunities I get is exactly what I had in mind at the time. ""My choice has provento be the right one.""

The 26-year-old Ivory Coast international was a purchase for former Gunners manager Unai Emery in 2019. However, he has arguably not shown the value of the over £70 million the North London team paid French outfit Lille for his services.  The attacker has not started a Premier League match for the club in the last six months, and despite the Gunners playing 34 matches already, Pepe has featured just 17 times.  It has been rumoured that Mikel Arteta is willing to let him go at the end of the ongoing campaign despite the player having a contract that runs until June 2024.  ""It has just not worked out. It is that simple. He is a talented player, that’s for sure. But it has not worked out for him,"" Campbell told Football Insider.  ""You see the intensity and focus that Mikel Arteta wants the team to play with. I don’t think Pepe fits into that. He is a drifter. He will concentrate for a bit and then drift out again.  ""I said just before Christmas it was a big few months coming up for Pepe. It was going to determine whether or not he had a future at Arsenal. Well, he doesn’t have a future at Arsenal.""  Arsenal are favourites to finish in the Champions League places this season after a much-improved campaign.  They are currently placed fourth on the table with 63 points from the 34 games they have played. However, they are facing stiff competition from North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur who are a position lower with 61 points.  Spurs have a tricky fixture away to Liverpool this weekend before hosting Arsenal in the London Derby.

Sky Sports News reported on March 31 Ten Hag was in pole position to land the job over Mauricio Pochettino, with sources close to the manager and Ajax revealing compensation is below £2m. The 52-year-old has signed a three-year deal with the option of a further 12 months.

That clarity is important."" John Murtough, United's football director, said: ""During the past four years at Ajax, Erik has proved himself to be one of the most exciting and successful coaches in Europe, renowned for his team's attractive, attacking football and commitment to youth. ""In our conversations with Erik leading up to this appointment, we were deeply impressed with his long-term vision for returning Manchester United to the level we want to be competing at, and his drive and determination to achieve that. ""We wish Erik the best of luck as he focuses on achieving a successful end to the season at Ajax and look forward to welcoming him to Manchester United this summer."" Ten Hag was understood to be the unanimous choice at United following a rigorous recruitment process that was led by Murtough and Darren Fletcher, the technical director. Richard Arnold, the executive vice-chairman, was also involved and the trio are understood to have agreed Ten Hag was the best candidate for the job. Mauricio Pochettino, the Paris Saint-Germain manager who previously coached Tottenham and Southampton, and Julen Lopetegui, the Sevilla boss, were also interviewed by United, but the club are believed to have felt the Dutchman was the one that most closely aligned with their plans for the future. Pochettino and Lopetegui are understood to have interviewed well, while Luis Enrique was also considered until it quickly became apparent he was committed to Spain ahead of this year's World Cup. United were looking for a number of attributes from their new manager, including proven success, a commitment to youth, the ability to improve players and the will to introduce an attractive style of play. Ten Hag is said to have set out his long-term vision to build a successful and exciting team during conversations with United, in which he is also said to have shown enthusiasm for the challenge he now faces at Old Trafford. Sky Sports News understands Ten Hag will tell United players he does not want any passengers at the club. His key message to them will be that he is the manager, there is a new regime and United are going to go back to playing like Manchester United. If there are any players who are not up for the challenge, they are welcome to leave, but everyone will start with a clean slate. He has not been given any specific targets, but he knows his job is to make United great again. Ten Hag also wants Steve McClaren to return to United and talks about making that happen are ongoing. The good relationship between United and Ajax helped smooth the process to appoint Ten Hag. It is believed potential negotiations with PSG, had United opted for Pochettino, would have proved more problematic.

Ten Hag is set to oversee a much-needed rebuild at United, with Rangnick - who is due to take up a consultancy role at Old Trafford this summer - saying after the 4-0 thrashing at rivals Liverpool on Tuesday that the side may need up to 10 new players. A number of first-team players, including Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard and Edinson Cavani, could be set to leave as part of the overhaul, with their contracts expiring at the end of the season. On Wednesday, the departures of Jim Lawlor, United's chief scout, and Marcel Bout, the head of global scouting, were announced.

""Ten Hag is a popular choice to take charge at Old Trafford and represents what is seen as a ""fresh, exciting future"", although there is an acceptance risk is involved as it is a sizeable leap for him. ""The last highly-successful Ajax coach to move to England's top flight - via Inter - was Frank de Boer, who lasted just 77 days at Crystal Palace. ""The expectations, global glare placed on United, and level of competition at the top end of the Premier League is like nothing he would have previously experienced."" Kaveh Solhekol, Sky Sports' chief reporter: ""The timing is not ideal if you are an Ajax supporter as they are in a race to win the Dutch title, but when Man Utd came calling, Erik ten Hag really could not turn down the club. ""It suits Man Utd to make this statement today for a variety of reasons: from a PR point of view, everybody connected with Man Utd wants some good news at the moment and also, it makes it clear what is happening at Man Utd over the next few months. There is clarity now - all the players who are thinking of leaving, or who Man Utd want to sign, know Ten Hag is going to be the new manager.

""I think Man Utd have made a lot of mistakes when it has come to appointing managers since Sir Alex Ferguson left, but this time round they think they have the right man and obviously he has a big, big job to do. ""But people need to retain a sense of perspective as well - I know the team are not playing as well or in the kind of way a Man Utd team should be playing. But let's not forget, less than 12 months ago, Man Utd finished second in the Premier League, they finished above Liverpool and over the past decade, six of the last 10 seasons they have finished above Liverpool. ""Man Utd are still a massive, massive club - one of the biggest clubs in the world. There are obviously still issues with the ownership structure, the way the club is run, but the big problem is they have not had the right manager in charge, and when they have had the right man, they have not given that manager enough time. ""This time round, when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer lost his job five months ago, we told you the replacement was going to be either Mauricio Pochettino or Erik ten Hag. I know a lot of people would have preferred Pochettino as he had Premier League experience with Southampton and Spurs, so it is a bit of a risk going for Ten Hag. ""Yes, he has done very well in Holland, but he has been managing the biggest club in Holland, he does not have any Premier League experience, but United have spoken to various candidates, they have interviewed Ten Hag, they interviewed Pochettino as well, and they have decided to go for Ten Hag. From United's point of view, it is great they have been able to get Ten Hag and announce it so quickly.""

We know the impact that had. He's won a couple of titles and cups in Holland. His style of play is good. He's got more experience than I think most people think at the age of 52. ""It's a massive jump but he's got a good coaching pedigree. He's not scarred and that's a good thing - he comes in fresh. I did a poll the other week and I was absolutely stunned - 220,000 people voted and 82 per cent were in favour of bringing him in over [Mauricio] Pochettino. ""I knew that he would be favourite because you can smell it on social media. I think Manchester United fans are demanding a fresh start and a fresh name. They want something that's completely different that they've not had before, and that's probably gone against Pochettino in some ways."" Sky Sports' Adam Bate: ""Erik ten Hag will go to Manchester United as an outsider tasked with implementing cultural change at one of the world's most famous clubs. But that is a job that he has done before. ""At Ajax, they mocked his accent. He was a Tukker - a man from the east of the country, a region known for a down-to-earth approach. There were those in sophisticated Amsterdam who did not believe the great Ajax had anything to learn from him. They were wrong. ""Two domestic doubles and one kick away from a Champions League final later and there is an acceptance Ten Hag has brought some of the best football that Ajax have seen in years. His methods have delivered success, his manner has won over the doubters."" Ten Hag's coaching journey from Twente to Ajax via Go Ahead Eagles explained in-depth by those who were there from the start... Erik ten Hag must waste no timing in tackling the pressing issues at Manchester United. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick - who is due to take up a consultancy role at Old Trafford this summer - believes the team could require 10 new players as part of a huge rebuild.

Clubs have between two and five games left to seal their fate but 19 out of 20 clubs are still challenging for the title, qualification for the Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League, or to avoid the drop. Data guru Ben Mayhew has calculated each club's range of possible final league positions and found only Norwich have nothing to play for besides pride during the remainder of this season. Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United are all in the hunt to join title-tussling Manchester City and Liverpool in the top four - with Spurs and United potentially slipping as low as eighth to miss out on Europe next season altogether. With seventh spot being the lowest position to potentially offer a European berth, if permutations play out across competitions, it means all teams from fifth to 13th-placed Aston Villa retain the potential to qualify for Europe. Norwich were relegated on Saturday after a 2-0 defeat to Villa and results conspired against them elsewhere, but, theoretically, every single team sitting above the Canaries up to ninth-placed Brighton could finish in the drop zone. Watford have been widely written off in the survival race but the Hornets could still finish in 16th, while the attention for that final relegation spot centres on Everton, Leeds and Burnley - but all three could still secure a top-half finish. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Premier League fixtures Mayhew has also simulated every possible result from the remaining games and calculated the probabilities of each club's possible final positions. The results suggest Manchester City have a 69-per-cent chance of retaining their Premier League crown, while Liverpool have almost the same chance of finishing as runners-up. Chelsea are nailed down for third spot at 93 per cent, with Arsenal pipping Tottenham to the final Champions League berth at 74 per cent - while Manchester United have a whopping 94-per-cent-chance of finishing in their current sixth spot. Each club’s attacking and defensive strength have been rated using an expected goals model, which measures the quality of chances they create and allow.  These ratings were then used to simulate the rest of the season 10,000 times to measure the probability of each club finishing in each league position. Further down the table - between Brighton and Southampton - things become far less predictable, with fairly even spreads between ninth and 15th. The probabilities consign Watford to the Championship but the pressure ramps up for the final drop spot, with Leeds favourites to finish in 18th (46 per cent), followed by Everton (31 per cent) and Burnley (23 per cent).

Jurgen Klopp's team head to Spain leading 2-0 as they look to progress to the final of Europe's premier club competition in Paris on May 28 against either Man City or Real Madrid. However, even if Liverpool fail to make it to the French capital, they have still managed to surpass the Chelsea side of 2006/07, whose own Quadruple challenge lasted all the way until May 1 of that campaign before losing to Liverpool in the Champions League semi-finals. And if Liverpool do manage to see off Villarreal on Tuesday, their next leg of the Quadruple will come against Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley on May 14, a repeat of this season's League Cup final, which the Reds won on penalties in February. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, in the race for the Premier League, Liverpool still just a point behind City as we enter the final four games of the season after an impressive unbeaten run in the league saw the champions' seemingly unsurmountable 14-point lead on January 15 evaporate. In total, Liverpool could face a gruelling seven-match schedule in May if they make it through to the final of European Cup at the Stade de France. So, how have other English teams got on when faced with such a daunting challenge, while surely the trophy-laden Liverpool sides of the 80s must have gone close to achieving the feat? And what about some of the great European giants of years gone by? Liverpool fixtures Premier League table As is surely common knowledge by now, no English team has ever won the Quadruple. Prior to this season, the closest any top-flight side had ever got to winning all four major trophies in a single campaign was Chelsea back in 2006/07. Heading into May of that season, Jose Mourinho's back-to-back Premier League champions had already landed the League Cup after beating Arsenal 2-1 at the Millennium Stadium, while they had an FA Cup final date to look forward to with Manchester United, who they were also going toe to toe with in the league. However, the Blues' challenge ended when they lost on penalties to Liverpool at Anfield in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final, while they would also go on to lose their title to United. Manchester United also came close to making history in 2008/09, only to slip up in the semi-finals of the FA Cup when losing 4-2 on penalties to Everton, although they did then get beaten 2-0 by Barcelona in that season's Champions League final in Rome. And, of course, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side have had numerous Quadruple bids as well since the Catalan arrived at the Etihad, the closest being in 2018/19 and last season. However, the former challenge was ended by Tottenham in the Champions League last eight and the latter after a defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals. Liverpool's current quest, though, will last at least until May 3, when the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with Villarreal concludes, meaning their Quadruple campaign will have lasted longer than any other English team's in history. And before you ask, Manchester United's famous Treble-winning season of 1998/99 actually included a League Cup quarter-final loss at Spurs in the December of that campaign. You would have thought Liverpool have come close before, but actually they have not, despite winning the League Cup four years in a row from 1981. It was the FA Cup that ultimately proved to be Liverpool's Achilles' heel in each of those four campaigns, with the Reds never managing to make it past the fifth round, meaning the closest they came was in 1982/83, only for a shock 2-1 home defeat to second division Brighton to end their Quadruple dreams in February. And it was Brighton again in the cup who scuppered the Reds' chances of winning all four trophies in their Treble-winning campaign the following season. Oddly enough, despite Klopp's 'Mentality Monsters' barely losing a game between 2018 and 2020, they never actually came close to winning the Quadruple. In fact, the nearest they came to achieving the feat was in their title-winning campaign of 2019/20, only for a youth side - selected because of a fixture clash with the Club World Cup - to lose 5-0 at Aston Villa in the League Cup quarter-finals to put an end that dream. In the first season in England when four trophies were up for grabs in 1960/61, it was Burnley who came closest before losing to Hamburg in the last eight of the European Cup in March 1961. However, Celtic did manage to accomplish the seemingly impossible in 1966-67 when Jock Stein's 'Lisbon Lions' won it all - the Scottish First Division, League Cup and Scottish Cup, followed by the first European Cup won by a British team after victory over Inter Milan. Well, the first thing to point out here is that up until the 2019-20 season, France, as in England, was the only other country in Europe's top-five major leagues to have an extra cup competition in the form of the League Cup, or Coupe de la Ligue. So that explains why European giants like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus have all never previously won the Quadruple. Paris Saint-Germain did, though, recently come within a whisker of pulling it off under Thomas Tuchel, only to fall agonisingly at the final hurdle. The big-spending Parisians were awarded that season's Ligue 1 title in April based on a points-per-game ratio after the campaign was prematurely curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when the season did eventually resume, PSG beat St Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final on July 24, before edging out Lyon 6-5 on penalties to claim the Coupe de la Ligue the following weekend. Then, when the Champions League also returned in August, Tuchel's team made it all the way to the final for the first time in the club's history, before unluckily losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich in Lisbon.

Eight years after moving to David Moyes's Manchester United from Chelsea, the Spanish number eight appeared to wave goodbye in style. In United's 3-0 win over Brentford on Monday night, Mata rolled back the years to his early Premier League days - who knows if we'll see him in England's top flight again? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mata showed pace, precision and skill that defies his veteran years - linking up with Cristiano Ronaldo frequently in a commanding first-half display. The pair - with a combined age of 71 - showed intricate passing in tight spaces which forced Mata to shoot wide of David Raya's goal - before the duo linked up again for Ronaldo's goal that was ruled out by VAR for offside. Ralf Rangnick recognised how much better United played and perhaps Mata was the cause of that. United had 74 per cent possession of the ball in the first half, with a passing accuracy of 91 per cent. ""That is the reason why we were controlling the game,"" said the German. ""It had to do with the players on the pitch such as Juan, Bruno [Fernandes] and Nemanja Matic."" While players such as Matic have confirmed they will be leaving United this summer, Mata is yet to do so. Rangnick couldn't confirm what the Spaniard will do, but hailed the midfielder's skill and professionalism in equal measure. Premier League table Premier League results Watch Premier League highlights Get Sky Sports ""I don't know [what he will do], he hasn't confirmed that but it's possible [that he will leave]. It was an important night for players who have been here quite a long time. If it was their last game to say farewell like this. ""In the last couple of weeks, he showed how professional he is and how much he loves his game. You can feel and see how much he is a professional player. He almost played like a magician.""Sam Blitz This was Brentford's first defeat with Christian Eriksen in the starting line-up but the Dane was blameless for that at Old Trafford. He was their outstanding performer and one of the best players on the pitch throughout, showcasing that trademark distribution. ""He has been so good, Eriksen,"" said Gary Neville on co-commentary for Sky Sports, before wondering about the player's future in the summer. ""There will be clubs a lot higher up than Brentford looking at him. Manchester United need a new midfield…"" Whether that move will come to fruition is unclear but Eriksen will clearly have options. Despite this being a convincing victory for Manchester United - Brentford were well beaten - the playmaker still created more chances than any player on the home team. It is wonderful to see Eriksen performing at something close to his best. Having proven his fitness and at only 30 years old, there are not many squads that he would not improve. It will be intriguing to find out what he decides to do next. For now, just enjoy him.Adam Bate Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In a World Cup year, the credentials of most of England's regular talent are examined in detail, but none more so than the number one position. Based on Sunday's superhuman display, Gareth Southgate needn't look any further than Jordan Pickford in Qatar - his performance may even be good enough to convince the staunchest of doubters. On a day where Everton's survival bid depended on three points, their goalkeeper was a man mountain. In actual fact, Pickford may have registered not one but two submissions for 'save of the season' - denying both Cesar Azpilicueta and Antonio Rudiger with monumental stops in the second half. ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves,"" said Sky Sports' Graeme Souness. It's difficult to disagree. The Toffees approach to the game was aggressive and that worked to unsettle Chelsea, who were a shade below their level best. Regardless, no player epitomised the game plan more than Pickford, who was dogged and antagonistic from the off. The 28-year-old had to be at his acrobatic best to preserve an all-important clean sheet and coped impressively under some relentless pressure, with Lampard reaffirming why he is so highly thought of on Merseyside: ""Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top level goalkeeping."" In the two Premier League meetings between Everton and Chelsea this season, the England international has managed 14 saves, conceding just once. The result may well be the spark Everton require to pull off a remarkable escape with five games remaining. Needless to say, they will have to exhibit a similar amount of stubbornness in every fixture between now and the end of term if that bid is to be successful.Laura Hunter Everton captain Seamus Coleman: ""That save he came back off the line and parried out was world class, and we see that on a daily basis in training, and that is why he is England's number one - some of the saves were world class.""   Everton boss Frank Lampard: ""Jordan made great saves. They are Chelsea and will have chances, but we had chances as well. Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top-level goalkeeping, I am happy with him and all the players, and all the subs who came on.""   Sky Sports' Graeme Souness: ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves. Some of the saves he's not entitled to get anywhere near them.""   Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp: ""The one to deny Azpilicueta is the save of the season. It was magnificent. We've given Pickford a lot of stick in the past, but he was brilliant."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Rob Holding was a surprise inclusion in Arsenal's team to face West Ham, but he certainly made his mark on the occasion. On a day when Mikel Arteta's side were some way below their fluid best, their stand-in centre-back typified the grit that got them over the line. Holding, starting alongside Gabriel Magalhaes in the absence of the injured Ben White, ensured Arsenal did not miss a player who had started more Premier League minutes than any other this season. He took his goal superbly, rising between two West Ham defenders to flick Bukayo Saka's corner past Lukasz Fabianski, but it was at the other end of the pitch that he truly shone. Shortly before his goal, there was a stunning block to deny the unmarked Manuel Lanzini. It was one of three he made over the course of the 90 minutes - two more than any other player. Holding put his body on the line repeatedly and also made nearly twice as many clearances (seven) as any of his team-mates. He was brave but also smart, positioning himself intelligently to cut out passes and ensure West Ham's forwards rarely threatened. Arteta was delighted by his contribution and talked up his importance in the dressing room - even if he does not get as many opportunities as he would like on the pitch. ""To good people, good things happen,"" said the Arsenal manager in his press conference. ""He's a phenomenal person and when you ask him to come, he's always ready."" With four, nerve-shredding games remaining in a gruelling top-four race, Holding's grit is sure to be needed again. Nick Wright Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tottenham's season has reached a defining stage. The long-awaited north London derby comes after a trip to title-chasing Liverpool, a daunting double before season-ending fixtures against Burnley and already-relegated Norwich. Sunday's victory over Leicester ensured Spurs' destiny remains in their hands ahead of the run-in and provided yet more evidence that Antonio Conte's squad harbours the talent required to complete a task that looked so unlikely when the Italian was appointed. Only Mohamed Salah has more Premier League goals to his name this season than Heung-min Son after the South Korean took his tally to 19 for the campaign in style with Spurs' spectacular third against the Foxes. It came after Son's first-half corner had set up Harry Kane for Tottenham's opener, with the striker ending his five-game goal drought with a clinical stooping header. The rekindling of Kane's goalscoring touch was enhanced by the impact surprise omission Dejan Kulusevski had coming off the bench and setting up both of Son's goals. Spurs' front three are firing - at the perfect time. If Spurs are going to pip north London rivals Arsenal to Champions League football, their front three are going to be crucial. Ahead of a pivotal final four games of the season, the manner of the victory over Leicester should have instilled confidence they can get the job done.Jack Wilkinson Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  North London is chasing. That's what will be at the forefront of Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel's mind after conceding defeat to a team blighted by potential relegation concerns. Perhaps Chelsea legs were tired - a legitimate grievance given they played away at Manchester United three days ago - but their performance was reserved, almost standoffish. Chelsea were far too kind to a side whose desperation could have easily played into their own hands. Chances were spurned, despite a heroic display from Everton stopper Jordan Pickford - over half of Chelsea's attempted shots (11) were off target. And yet there was still no sign of Romelu Lukaku from the bench. Third spot is still the Blues to lose, but both Arsenal and Tottenham are closing in. Stamford Bridge will now be cautiously looking over its proverbial shoulder. Three of Chelsea's six Premier League losses this season have come in their last six games - so is form a problem ahead of an FA Cup final against high-flying Liverpool on May 14? Well, it's clear that a prerequisite of the Chelsea job is silverware - something that Tuchel has previously delivered. But this season threatens to crumble if Chelsea manage to slip out of the top-four race and allow favourites Liverpool to clinch the FA Cup. The latter is the likelier of scenarios, but Chelsea must remain alert. They face Wolves, Leeds, Leicester and Watford in the Premier League run-in; crucially, three of those fixtures are at home. The Blues must draw upon their Stamford Bridge dominance to see them through a tricky patch and ensure they supersede their London rivals in the hunt for a top three finish.Laura Hunter Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Leicester have conceded 14 goals from corners in the Premier League this season, the most of any side, and it once again led to their downfall at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The visitors had started promisingly, with Patson Daka striking the foot of a post from inside the Tottenham area. But against the run of play the hosts took the lead when Harry Kane headed in from a corner, completely unmarked, which spurred them on to a 3-1 victory. Rodgers made eight changes to his side, with their focus firmly on the Europa Conference League semi-finals, yet no matter who they have fielded during this campaign, defending corners has been a constant issue. ""Defending corners has been a problem for us all season - we lack aggression and cuteness. It was so disappointing,"" said Rodgers, whose side have surpassed the most conceded in a single season since Brighton's 16 in 2017-18. ""It is something we will have to look at in the summer through personnel. The mentality to head the ball is missing, it's something we would need to address.""David Richardson Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

The probabilities consign Watford to the Championship but the pressure ramps up for the final drop spot, with Leeds favourites to finish in 18th (46 per cent), followed by Everton (31 per cent) and Burnley (23 per cent).

How Premier League could have nine teams in European competitions next season,"The race for Europe is on but which teams make it - and how many - is still to be decided. With the Premier League campaign reaching its climax, we look at: There are seven European spots open to English sides - although that number could rise to nine and the amount of teams in each individual competition can shift. As a basis: However, because this season the FA Cup winner will be either Liverpool or Chelsea, and both those teams look set to finish in the top four, their Europa League qualifying spot for winning the FA Cup will be passed down to the next highest Premier League finisher who doesn't qualify for Europe. Similarly, because Liverpool won the Carabao Cup and are set to finish in the top four, their Europa Conference League qualifying spot from that competition will go to the next highest Premier League finisher without European football. So that means sides which finish sixth and seventh in the Premier League table are in contention for a place in either the Europa League or Europa Conference League next season. Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal would qualify for the Champions League by finishing in the Premier League's top four positions. Tottenham would go into the Europa League, along with Manchester United (who would get in thanks to Chelsea or Liverpool passing on their spot from winning the FA Cup). Seventh-placed West Ham would qualify for the Europa Conference League, thanks to Liverpool's Carabao Cup winner's spot being passed on. Manchester City and Liverpool have pulled clear at the top of the Premier League, and while their battle to win the Premier League title continues, they don't have to worry about Champions League qualification. Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp will still be plotting how to win this year's competition, and could meet in the final, but they already have their places in next season's tournament wrapped up through the league. Meanwhile, the last two spots in the top four are still up for grabs with Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham in contention with four games remaining. However, whatever the outcome, it will be a top-six finish at the very least for Chelsea and Arsenal, who return to European competition after missing out last season. Although not mathematically done yet, Spurs have all but guaranteed a Europa League spot with a nine-point gap between them and seventh-placed West Ham, who have just three matches left to play this season. Antonio Conte's side also have a far superior goal difference to the Hammers. The battle for the final Europa League spot continues between Man Utd and West Ham, while Wolves also have their eyes on finishing seventh and potentially securing a place in the Europa Conference League. If Manchester City or Liverpool win the Champions League they will automatically qualify for the competition's group stages next season. That is irrespective of where they finish in the Premier League table. If they qualify for the competition through two methods - ie: they win it and finish in the top four - there is no extra Champions League spot created for another team to fill and the number of Premier League clubs in next season's Champions League will remain at four. The Premier League could have a maximum of five teams in the Champions League next season, though, if West Ham won the Europa League and finished outside the top four. Winning that competition qualifies them for the Champions League group stages. If Leicester win the Europa Conference League they will automatically qualify for next season's Europa League - another additional European spot. That means, if West Ham and Leicester win their competitions and finish outside the Premier League's top seven there will be nine English sides in European competition next season. The nine sides would be: the top four and West Ham in the Champions League, fifth and sixth place, plus Leicester, in the Europa League, and seventh place in the Europa Conference League. But if Leicester were to win the Europa Conference League and finish seventh - the place set to be rewarded with a Europa Conference League spot - there would be no English side in the Europa Conference League next season, as Leicester would be bumped up to the Europa League. That happened in Spain last season with Sevilla and no La Liga side involved in the Europa Conference League. With Liverpool and Manchester City in the Champions League semi-finals, there's a good chance an English side would win the tournament - but that would have no impact on European qualification, with both sides set to finish in the top four. West Ham are into the semis of the Europa League and an additional Champions League spot is up for grabs if they win that competition. Their Europa Conference League spot for finishing seventh would disappear.Leicester - 10 points off seventh with two games in hand - could be playing European football again next year if they progress from their semi-final and win the Europa Conference League to earn an additional spot in the Europa League. Regardless of any permutation, no side finishing eighth in the Premier League will qualify for Europe, unless they've won a domestic or European cup. Eighth-placed Wolves would be the highest-finishing Premier League team to miss out on European football, although they are just three points behind West Ham and five off Manchester United, with a game in hand on both.

https://www.sportbible.com/football/six-years-ago-today-jamie-vardy-hosted-leicesters-title-winning-party-20220502,Six Years Ago Today Jamie Vardy Hosted The Ultimate Title Winning Party,"On this day in 2016, Leicester City players gathered at Jamie Vardy's house to see if they would complete an incredible Premier League title race. Loadingâ¦ Six years ago, Leicester were on the verge of the most incredible league winning campaign in the history of the Premier League's history. Having narrowly avoided relegation the previous season, the club had appointed Claudio Ranieri in the summer and the team went on an incredible run to make the impossible suddenly seem possible. On May 2nd title chasers Tottenham Hotspur, themselves trying to win a first league title since 1961, travelled to champions Chelsea in a must win game. The Blues were having a dreadful season but knew that stopping London rivals Spurs picking up all three points would result in Leicester being crowned champions. Whilst things were about to heat up in London, the Foxes' players gathered at Vardy's house to watch the game, as life imitated art, with the fan's ""Jamie Vardy's having a party"" chant came to life. The game at Stamford Bridge would become to be known as the 'Battle of the Bridge,' but it started in relatively basic circumstances for that campaign. Harry Kane scored his 25th goal of the league season, and when Son Heung-min doubled the lead before half time it looked like the champagne would have to be put on ice, as Spurs eyed their first win away to the Blues since 1990. A challenge by Danny Rose on Willian sparked angry scenes, with Mauricio Pochettino entering the pitch to split the two men, before Moussa Dembele gouged Diego Costa's eyes in the melee. Spurs were lucky Rose wasn't sent off for the challenge but then at half time momentum shifted as Eden Hazard was brought on as a substitute. Chelsea got on top with the introduction of the Belgian, despite his poor season to that date, but it was Gary Cahill who scored their first goal. Hazard grabbed the equaliser with seven minutes to go and things got uglier with challenges flying in from the visitors, inspired by the Chelsea players who had said they wanted to get one over their rivals and help Leicester, in the build up to the match. When the full time whistle blew it ended Spurs' slim hopes of winning the league and sparked incredible scenes at Vardy's house party. This will never ever grow old ð¬#OnThisDay in 2016, the Foxes squad assembled.You know what happened next... ð¦ ð ð pic.twitter.com/KNv1V1hkvK Ranieri's side then faced Everton five days later at the King Power Stadium, where the fans were able to join their heroes in celebrating the title. Before kick off the players and the manager were serenaded by Andrea Bocelli singing Nessun Dorma, before they went on to beat the Toffees 3-1. Andrea #Bocelli serenading Claudio #Ranieri & #Leicester City is the most powerful thing you'll see all year. pic.twitter.com/Xv0fFl6yAW They finished off the season with a 1-1 draw against Chelsea to finish on 81 points and ended up winning the title by 10 points, showing the gap between them and the rest. It wasn't Spurs who they beat however, with Pochettino's side losing 5-1 to relegated Newcastle United on the final day and slipping behind Arsenal into third. Though it was the Battle of the Bridge that ended up giving Leicester their incredible title, that night it was all about the scenes at the Vardy residence. Easily the greatest party in Premier League history, fitting for arguably the greatest title win in the era! ",positive,spurs,5

Bergwijn arrived at the club as a 22-year-old from PSV Eindhoven for a £27m fee in the January window two years ago, but he has struggled to nail down a regular spot in the first XI. A dream Premier League debut saw Bergwijn net in a 2-0 victory at home to Manchester City, while he has appeared on 29 occasions in all competitions during the 2021-22 season. However, Bergwijn has only managed to register four goals and two assists in that spell, with both of his Premier League strikes coming in that dramatic late victory at Leicester City back in January. Bergwijn's heroics in that game have not led to better fortunes for the 24-year-old, though, and he has only made the first XI in four top-flight games this term. © Reuters As a result, Bergwijn is being strongly linked with an exit from Antonio Conte's side in the upcoming summer window as he pushes for a place in the Netherlands squad at the 2022 World Cup. With Bergwijn's compatriot Erik ten Hag taking over at Manchester United in the summer, the Red Devils are supposedly interested in bringing the Dutchman to Old Trafford as part of their attacking shake-up. The former PSV man has now admitted that a transfer away from Spurs is the likeliest option at the end of the season, telling Dutch outlet AD: ""A starting place here? I honestly don't think so. ""It's a difficult story for me. It's good up front, but I don't play much. There are still four games to go. After that, we will see in the summer what is best for both parties. It's important to me that I'm going to play now."" Bergwijn spent six years in the youth setup at Ajax between 2005 and 2011 before heading for PSV, and the Dutchman would be open to a return to the Amsterdam giants. ""Ajax would certainly be an option. A return to the Netherlands would certainly be an option for me. The World Cup is coming. Mr Van Gaal, the national coach, brought me into the squad last time, even though I didn't play much,"" Bergwijn added. © Reuters ""Of course it's nice that you just score those goals and show that you can be a full-fledged player. But then you come back to the club and you hardly play. In the summer we really have to look for a solution."" When asked about the prospect of linking up with Ten Hag at Man United next season, Bergwijn left the door open to a possible move, responding: ""I haven't spoken to him yet, but who knows, maybe that will happen."" Bergwijn was brought off the bench for the final eight minutes of Sunday's 3-1 home win over Leicester City, and he has not started a Premier League game for Conte's side since their 2-0 loss to Chelsea on January 23. The Dutchman has now made a total of 80 appearances in all competitions for the North London club, during which time he has scored eight goals and set up 10 more. In spite of his struggles at club level, Bergwijn came up with the goods for the Netherlands in March's international friendlies, bagging a brace against Denmark in a 4-2 win before also making the net ripple in a 1-1 draw with Germany. The three-time Eredivisie champion remains under contract at Tottenham until the end of the 2024-25 campaign, and the Lilywhites may allegedly be prepared to consider offers of around £15m for the out-of-favour attacker this summer.

That has limited Gollini to just eight appearances in all competitions, none of which have come in the Premier League with his last outing coming back on January 12. According to Calciomercato, the 27-year-old will now return to Atalanta where further conversations will be held regarding his future.

According to SBI Soccer, Celtic have now begun negotiations with Tottenham over a permanent deal for the USA international, which could see the Hoops pay around £6m plus an additional £4m in add-ons. However, the report adds that the Hoops may face stern competition from Leicester City, Watford and Wolverhampton Wanderers for the player's signature. Postecoglou revealed in January that he is keen to see Carter-Vickers move to Parkhead permanently and suggested that Celtic recruited the centre-back with a long-term plan in mind.

Reports have suggested that an agreement has now been reached for the Dutchman to sign a four-year deal with Man United, while current boss Rangnick moves up into an advisory role. Confirmation of Ten Hag's appointment could allegedly arrive soon after Ajax's KNVB-Beker game against PSV Eindhoven on Sunday, and speculation has already started swirling regarding possible coaching appointments and signings early in his reign. The Daily Mail claims that Tottenham's Steven Bergwijn is one of the players on his radar, having held a long-standing interest in the 24-year-old. Ten Hag attempted to sign Bergwijn for Ajax during the January transfer window, only for Spurs to block the deal in the hope that the Netherlands international would help to secure Champions League qualification this season. However, the winger has since started just one Premier League game, falling behind January arrival Dejan Kulusevski in the pecking order courtesy of the Juventus loanee's prolific partnership with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. The report claims that Tottenham would now be willing to let Bergwijn leave the club this summer, but only if their £20m asking price is met. There is understood to be interest from clubs in Germany and France, although Ten Hag's possible arrival at Old Trafford could see Manchester United jump to the front of the queue. Ten Hag was in the stadium to watch Bergwijn score three times for Netherlands in games against Denmark and Germany during the recent international break, and has reportedly tried to sign him for Ajax in each of the last three transfer windows. Bergwijn recently hinted that he will assess his future in the summer due to a lack of playing time at Spurs. Ten Hag, meanwhile, is thought to want to bring the likes of Antonio Rudiger, Jurrien Timber and Declan Rice to Old Trafford should he take over, while coaches such as Robin van Persie, Steve McClaren and Mitchell van der Gaag are among those to have been linked with a backroom role under the 52-year-old. Bergwijn has featured 27 times in all competitions for Spurs this season, including 20 in the Premier League, but only four of those league appearances have been from the start. Since joining Spurs from PSV in January 2020, he has scored eight goals and created 10 more in 78 appearances.  ",negative,spurs,4

The arrival of Dejan Kulusevski has not helped Bergwijn's chances of regular game time, though, and it appears that the North Londoners are ready to lower their valuation. According to Calciomercato, Spurs are now prepared to entertain offers in the region of €18m (£15.02m) with Kulusevski expected to join on a permanent basis in the future.

Gnabry only has little over a year left to run on his contract with Bayern, though, and there has been a host of speculation surrounding his future over the last few months. Tottenham Hotspur have been linked with the Germany international, while Arsenal are also believed to be considering making an attempt to bring him back to the club. According to Bild, Bayern have offered the attacker the chance to double his salary to a figure in the region of £14m. The proposed new deal would place the German alongside Kingsley Coman and Leroy Sane in terms of the highest earners at Allianz Arena, but Gnabry allegedly does not view the wage packet as a priority. © Reuters The report claims that the forward does not currently feel valued by Bayern and is unsure whether he will be a key player for the club moving forward. Gnabry initially joined Arsenal from Stuttgart in 2011 but failed to become a first-team regular for the club, only making 18 appearances in all competitions before leaving for Werder Bremen. An impressive spell in Bremen led to Bayern signing him in 2017, and he has scored 63 goals and registered 40 assists in 169 appearances for the Munich giants during a successful spell.

Arsenal and Tottenham are currently battling for fourth spot in the Premier League table, with the former two points ahead of their capital rivals on the same number of games (33). Real Madrid have also been credited with an interest in Gnabry, although the Spanish giants are thought to have other priorities, including Paris Saint-Germain's Kylian Mbappe.  ",negative,spurs,1
https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/transfer-talk/news/pochettino-backtracks-on-comments-over-mbappe-future_484781.html,Mauricio Pochettino backtracks on comments over Kylian Mbappe future,"The 23-year-old is yet to pen an extension on his existing deal at the Parc des Princes, which is now due to expire in under two months' time. Mbappe is therefore still set to leave as a free agent when his contract runs out at the end of the season, with Real Madrid still being persistently linked with a summer swoop for the World Cup winner. However, there is now understood to be more optimism about the prospect of Mbappe penning fresh terms with the Ligue 1 champions following talks between the club and the player's family. When asked during a press conference how confident he was about the club's chances of keeping Mbappe at this moment in time, Pochettino responded ""100%"", but the Argentine took those words back following his side's 3-3 draw with Strasbourg on Friday night, as well as a similar comment that he made regarding his own future at the club. © Reuters ""I'm very tired because it's hard to explain, but I tried. I only answered the question I was asked: 'Today, what percentage is there?' 'For me, 100 percent. Kylian too,' I said,"" Pochettino told Amazon Prime Video. ""I don't understand why this was taken out of context. I'm very tired, but I'm strong and I don't care about rumours. I'm focused on football, on my players. We continue to do our job. ""That's the problem. We are here to work for the club, to give our best, and there is a lack of respect all the time. ""We will continue to work, we are very happy that the team does not give up, it is still professional, it wants to play. Tomorrow is tomorrow, but today I am 100 percent involved with PSG."" Pochettino collected his first domestic league crown as PSG clinched the Ligue 1 title with a 1-1 draw against Lens last month, but the Argentine's own future is being heavily called into question following their Champions League collapse at the hands of Real Madrid. The ex-Tottenham Hotspur manager was considered one of the frontrunners for the Manchester United job before the appointment of Erik ten Hag, although a recent report claimed that the French champions are indeed planning to part ways with Pochettino. © Reuters Current Spurs boss Antonio Conte has been tipped to take over at PSG should Pochettino depart as expected, but the Italian recently dismissed such links as ""fake news"" and ""lies"". Meanwhile, Mbappe is not expected to make a decision on his future until the end of the 2021-22 campaign, during which he has already bagged a staggering 35 goals and 23 assists in 43 matches across all tournaments. Twenty-four of Mbappe's goals and 16 of his assists have come in 32 Ligue 1 matches for the newly-crowned champions, as he scored two and set up Achraf Hakimi but could not prevent PSG from giving up a 3-1 lead to draw 3-3 with Strasbourg on Friday. Mbappe unsurprisingly leads the way in both goals and assists in Ligue 1, with his 24 strikes three clear of closest challengers Wissam Ben Yedder and Martin Terrier, while teammate Lionel Messi is closest behind in assists with 13. The 2021-22 Ligue 1 title represents Mbappe's 12th major honour with Les Parisiens since his initial loan move from Monaco, with the striker picking up four Ligue 1 crowns, a trio of Coupe de France and French Super Cup crowns, as well as two French League Cups. Should Mbappe complete a free transfer away from the Parc des Princes alongside Angel Di Maria, PSG have reportedly offered a big-money deal to Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele, who will also become a free agent in July.

Chelsea have led the way, spending more than £200million in recent months, but United's only capture, to the chagrin of their army of supporters, has been Dutch midfielder Donny Van De Beek from Ajax. Edinson Cavani is highly likely to bolster Manchester United's forward line (Andrew Milligan/PA) Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has once again had to bear the brunt of criticism with United so far unable to strike deals for forward pair Jadon Sancho and Ousmane Dembele from Borussia Dortmund and Barcelona respectively.  Dortmund's 120m euros (£108m) asking price for Sancho has been a key issue in recent months while sporting director Michael Zorc told reporters on Saturday that ""the door is closed"", which seems to bring an end to speculation.  United are highly likely to strengthen their forward line with the capture of veteran Uruguayan Edinson Cavani following his release by Paris St Germain, but other areas of concern for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer may go unaddressed.  They had been linked with Gareth Bale before he ultimately plumped for a return to Spurs, where Alli seems to be surplus to requirements having not played in the top flight since their season-opening defeat to Everton.  PSG have already had one offer rejected and have been tipped to make a follow-up loan bid for the 24-year-old, who has been left out of Gareth Southgate's England squad for the fixtures against Wales, Belgium and Denmark. Dele Alli was not included in England's latest squad for their three fixtures in October (Jonathan Brady/PA) Arsenal could raid Chelsea for the second time this summer. Having signed Willian on a free transfer, Gunners boss Mikel Arteta is out to boost his midfield options and Jorginho is reported to fit the bill.  Even though Frank Lampard has strengthened in the middle of the park by signing Hakim Ziyech and Kai Havertz – with Ben Chilwell, Edouard Mendy and Timo Werner also joining in big-money moves – the Blues head coach may be reluctant to let go of a player who has twice captained the side this season.  Manchester City's stuttering start to the campaign might see them make a late foray into the transfer market for a new left-back, with Bayern Munich's David Alaba and Ajax's Nicolas Tagliafico among those being apparently courted.  Champions Liverpool are rumoured to be eyeing a last-gasp swoop for Dembele but having added Diogo Jota, Thiago Alcantara and Kostas Tsimikas to their ranks, Jurgen Klopp is probably satisfied with his lot.  Merseyside rivals Everton are bracing themselves for bids for Moise Kean, allegedly attracting interest from PSG and former club Juventus, but his departure could pave the way for Arkadiusz Milik to join the Toffees from Napoli. Sean Dyche's Burnley are yet to record a point in the Premier League this season (Martin Rickett/PA) Leeds, who have made a whirlwind start in their first top-flight campaign in 16 years, are supposed to be closing in on Rennes winger Raphinha while Norwich's Todd Cantwell is also a priority for the Elland Road club.  Burnley, without a point from their opening four matches, have seen Jeff Hendrick, Aaron Lennon and Joe Hart all leave Turf Moor and their only outfield signing so far has been Dale Stephens from Brighton.  Manager Sean Dyche has made plain the need for reinforcements but may, in fact, be relieved to see the window shut with West Ham and Leicester sniffing around centre-half James Tarkowski.

Spurs face a daunting trip to quadruple-chasing Liverpool on Saturday evening before Arsenal host Leeds, who have been dragged into the thick of a three-way relegation fight. With a two-point lead over their bitter rivals, fourth-placed Arsenal will be the more comfortable of the two, and this weekend offers them a good chance to open up a five-point gap on Spurs and potentially a cushion going into the north London derby at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Thursday week. But this is merely a scrap for fourth place, quite different to the relentless nature of the title race between Liverpool and Manchester City. Neither Arsenal nor Spurs have shown enough consistency this season to suggest they are certain to win their three other fixtures, so there should be more twists to come. If Spurs have an X-factor, it is their world-class individuals. In head coach Antonio Conte, they have one of the game’s best, while Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester was made comfortable by the brilliance of Harry Kane, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski at one end and Cristian Romero at the other. Arsenal, by contrast, are lacking the same star quality but feel like a more rounded team under Mikel Arteta, further along in their rebuild than their neighbours. Last month, Brighton and Brentford offered a blueprint of how to nullify Conte’s Spurs — specifically, deny them space in the final third and stop Kane getting on the ball — and, in having a more clearly-defined system, Arsenal are harder to stop and better at breaking down stubborn opponents. Arteta is also getting more from his squad than Conte, and important performances from fringe players Mohamed Elneny, Eddie Nketiah and Rob Holding in the wins over Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham point to a united group, with deceptive depth. By contrast, Lucas Moura was hopelessly rusty on his first Spurs start since mid-February on Sunday, while Harry Winks was off the pace in a late cameo, hardly surprisingly given Conte has barely changed his XI for over two months. Both clubs have been impacted by injuries in the same positions, with Spurs losing midfielder Oliver Skipp and wing-back Matt Doherty, and Arsenal without Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney in similar positions. Mikel Arteta vs Antonio Conte - who will win the race for Champions League qualification? The absences may prove crucial in the run-in. In Nuno Tavares, who is deputising for Tierney at left wing-back, Arsenal have an agent of chaos, and while the Portuguese is in the team there is a chance they will drop points in any game. Kulusevski, who came off the bench to twice assist Son on Sunday, should have the beating of Tavares if they both start on May 12. For all their star quality up front, Spurs, though, are weak on both flanks. In the absence of Doherty and Sergio Reguilon, who is sidelined indefinitely with a groin injury, wing-backs Emerson Royal and Ryan Sessegnon failed to make an impact in the final third against Leicester. But it is long past the point where Conte is likely to change his system or experiment on the flanks. If Arsenal allow Spurs’ wing-backs to have the ball, and keep it away from their forwards, they will be in a strong position next week. Spurs finish the season against Burnley, who are likely to be fighting for survival, and already-relegated Norwich, while Arsenal face a tough trip to Newcastle and host Everton on the final day, when the Toffees may also be playing for their Premier League status. The derby will surely be crucial, but the fight for Champions League football could come down to Spurs’ individual brilliance against Arsenal’s collective cohesion and unity. Whatever happens in the next fortnight, expect the contest to go the wire. ",positive,spurs,11
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-tottenham-north-london-derby-rob-holding-b997628.html,Rob Holding urges Arsenal not be distracted by crucial Tottenham derby with Leeds clash up first,"ob Holding has warned his Arsenal team-mates not to get distracted by next week’s Champions League decider against Tottenham ahead of their meeting with Leeds. Arsenal are currently sat fourth in the Premier League table, two points ahead of Spurs in fifth with four games left to play this season. The rivals are set to go head to head a week on Thursday (May 12) in a match that is being billed as one of the biggest north London derbies in recent history. Holding admits the Arsenal squad are well aware that game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium will have a huge say on who qualifies for the Champions League, but the centre-back has also urged his team-mates not to allow it to distract them as Leeds visit the Emirates on Sunday. “We have got to take it a game at a time,” Holding told Standard Sport, when asked about the north London derby. “Obviously we have got Leeds at the weekend and that’s always an intense game. “They come and bring energy. It will be a tough game, but we are at home with the fans behind us and we can try to chalk up another three points. Rob Holding has warned Arsenal not to look past Leeds with a crucial north London derby looming “Then the following week on the Thursday we have Tottenham, so that’s what it’ll come down to and it should be a good game.” Arsenal and Tottenham have been neck and neck in the top-four race, and they momentarily swapped places on Sunday after Spurs beat Leicester in the early kick-off. The Gunners responded by defeating West Ham and have now won three games on the spin after initially losing the same number of matches at the start of April. Those wins have come against Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham, with Holding partly putting the turnaround down to Arsenal supporters sticking by the team during a difficult spell. “I think since Mikel [Arteta] has come in there has been a big change in mentality and connecting with the fans,” he said. “I think on Sunday the fans were amazing again and they have been for the last couple of weeks, in terms of away games and at home. “That’s why our results have been decent since those three that we lost. We bounced back and they stuck by us. It could have been an easy point to turn on us, but they stuck by us and we’ve had three good results now.” ",negative,spurs,2

Son reached 19 goals for the season with a clinical double in Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester, making him the outright top scorer from open play in the Premier League and behind only Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah -- on 22 -- in the race for the Golden Boot. Both of Son’s goals came with his supposedly weaker left foot, including a stunning effort into the top corner to make it 3-0, and he also assisted Harry Kane’s opener with a corner. Kane is widely regarded as one of the best forwards in the world but Son is often overlooked in debates about the league’s best marksmen, despite his consistency. Asked about the front five of next weekend’s opponents Liverpool, Sessegnon said he would not swap Kane or Son for anyone and believes the latter is underrated on account of his character. Asked if Son is one of the best in the world, Sessegnon said: ""100 per cent. He has been consistent over the last six or seven years, doing it at the top level and the numbers speak for themselves. ""It’s hard to know why he is underrated because consistently, season after season, his numbers are there. I think it’s because he’s such a down-to-earth, normal guy. He’s not an arrogant person and he’s just very friendly with everyone. That’s probably why [he is underrated]. ""Of course, [Son and Kane] make it much easier for us. They can do special things on the ball and you saw that again on Sunday. Sonny assisted H again and their combination they’ve had ever since playing together is unbelievable. ""No way [would we swap them]. The two players we have [up front] are world class and we wouldn’t swap them for anyone."" Sessegnon’s Spurs career has been revived under Antonio Conte and he is hoping the head coach remains at the club next season, despite his consistent refusals to commit beyond the end of the current campaign. The wing-back insists the speculation over Conte’s future is not a distraction for the squad and says the Italian is helping to restore his confidence after a succession of hamstring injuries. ""Is the speculation unsettling? Not really, not at all,"" Sessegnon said. ""We’re professionals and we focus on our game and step by step. You heard him yourself, [the speculation is] obviously false news, he’s focusing on here at the club. As players we’re just focusing on our job going forward and that’s all we can do. ""Of course I hope he stays, he’s a top manager and he’s shown that with us this season. We hope he’s here next season and for us the main objective is to get in that top four and then prepare for next season. ""It has not been easy [for me] since I’ve been at the club, but step by step he gives me confidence in every game to go and do what I can do,"" Sessegnon added. ""For me it’s about believing in myself and getting in that positive run, feeling good and keep pushing. ""Every day, every game as well learning bit by bit, the defensive side, the attacking side. Of course he’s very demanding and [as a wing-back] you need to be up and down. You almost have to manage yourself when to go, when to relax a little bit, but it is relentless."" Asked if he now has confidence in his body to remain injury-free, the 21-year-old added: ""Definitely. At times it is quite hard, it’s a mental battle with the physical side as well. Right now I feel good and I’m giving 100 per cent every time I’m out there."" Arsenal’s win at West Ham later on Sunday means Spurs remain two points behind their fourth-placed rivals and need to beat quadruple-chasing Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday to guarantee they will be within touching distance of their neighbours in next week’s potentially crucial north London derby. Sessegnon impressed in the 2-2 draw with Jurgen Klopp’s side in December and says both the team and himself can take confidence from that performance. ""We’ll look at the game and see the positives and take those positives into the next game at Anfield,"" he said. ""We know it’s a different stage of the season and we have to manage it. But again when we have the chances to score, we should take those chances. ""I think every game I play in this team gives me confidence to go and do what I want to do on the pitch, especially against the big teams as I played well in the last game when they came here. It’ll be no different going into that game."" ",positive,spurs,2

Harry Kane’s goal and a Heung-min Son double ensured Spurs moved above their north London neighbours, at least temporarily, with the Gunners due to play West Ham later in the day. A much-changed Leicester, who are prioritising Thursday’s Conference League semi-final decider against Roma, struck the post early on through Patson Daka but were undone when Kane header home Son’s corner in the first half. After the break, South Korean finished inside the box from substitute Dejan Kulusevski’s pass before curling home a stunning effort from 20 yards to seal an important victory. Kelechi Iheanacho bagged a late consolation for Leicester when his long-range effort range crept inside the near post. Dan Kilpatrick was at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to rate the Spurs players... Hugo Lloris 7 Made a fine fingertip save to turn Daka’s early effort on to the post and quick off his line when needed. Couldn’t keep out Iheanacho’s late strike, which was right in the corner. Cristian Romero 9 A presence at both ends of the pitch in another imposing display. Made the second goal with a magnificent double tackle, the second absolutely cleaning out Caglar Soyuncu. Eric Dier 8 Won some important headers in a calm performance. Coped well with sub Jamie Vardy for the final 25 minutes. Ben Davies 7 Gifted Leicester an early chance in a sloppy moment but solid thereafter. Stepped out of defence well on a couple of occasions. Emerson Royal 5 Tidy and worked hard but failed to make any impact in the final third. He was involved in the build up to Son’s second goal, however. Rodrigo Bentancur 7 Passing was hit and miss, but got struck in and helped Spurs to establish midfield dominance after the interval. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg 7 Used the ball well and was one of Spurs’ better players in the first half, despite a mix-up with Romero leading to Daka’s chance. Might have been clear on goal from Kulusevski’s pass but touch was poor. Ryan Sessegnon 6 Got in some good positions but struggled to make inroads against his opposite man in another difficult outing. Still looked short of confidence. Lucas Moura 4 Back in the XI for the first time since the defeat to Wolves in mid-February, he did nothing to suggest he has deserved more playing time. Never got going and was more liability than threat. Heung-min Son 9 Made the game safe with two second half goals, including a stunning curling finish. Assisted Kane with a near-post corner in a match-winning display. Harry Kane 7 Continued his remarkable record against Leicester with an 18th goal in 17 appearances, a firm header from Son’s corner. Subs Dejan Kulusevski (Lucas 55’) 8 Responded to being rested with an immediate impact from the bench, slipping in Son to double the scoring and setting up his second goal with a simple pass. Harry Winks (Bentancur 81’) 4 Beaten too easily by Iheanacho in the build up to Leicester’s goal. Steven Bergwijn (Son 81’) 6 No repeat of his late heroics at the King Power in a brief cameo.

The Dutchman, who was the subject of interest from Ajax over the course of the January transfer window, has not started a Premier League game since mid-January following the arrival of Dejan Kulusevski. With Lucas Moura also seemingly ahead of him in the pecking order and Spurs’ attack proving prolific under Antonio Conte, the forward’s chances of breaking into the starting XI look remote at best. Only one of his four starts this season has come under Conte, with the former PSV star failing to capitalise on the famous brace he scored at Leicester during a dramatic win back in January. Spurs snubbed a £15m offer from Ajax and Conte has previously hinted he would like to keep Bergwijn, although the player himself appeared to cast doubt on his Tottenham future when speaking to Dutch outlet Algemeen Dagblad. “A place in the starting line up? Here? I honestly don’t think so,” he said. “The attack works well, but I don’t get to play much. “A return to the Netherlands would certainly be an option for me. The World Cup is coming. Mr. Van Gaal, the national coach, brought me into the selection last time, even though I didn’t play much.” “Then you come back to the club and you barely play. It is a shame, of course.

Tottenham’s win over Leicester earlier in the day had piled the pressure on Arteta’s side, who kicked-off in fifth place and without key defender Ben White, who missed out with a tight hamstring. In as his replacement, Holding scored the first Premier League goal of his career when he glanced in an opener just after the half-hour mark before Jarrod Bowen’s equaliser. Gabriel would then score a second header as Arsenal saw the game out, moving back above Spurs in a tight Champions League battle. It was another impressive performance from Holding in particular, his second in quick-succession after playing a crucial role in the 4-2 win at Chelsea last month, a result that got Arsenal moving back up the table following a run of three consecutive losses. After the game, Arteta told Sky Sports: “We showed incredible spirit because when we could play the way we wanted to play we had to find a way to play the way they prefer. We adapted. You have to find a way to win all the time to win - forcing mistakes, being brilliant, digging in, clean sheets. “I am really happy, especially for Rob Holding as he hasn’t played the amount of minutes he deserves.

After a dull opening half an hour, Rob Holding – who once again impressed - scored the first Premier League goal of his career with a glancing header following Bukayo Saka’s corner. From there, the game burst into life. Seconds after Holding’s opener, Aaron Ramsdale pulled off a brilliant reactionary save as Declan Rice’s near-post flick-on flew towards him at break-neck speed. As is becoming customary for this West Ham side, David Moyes’ team were able to feed off a loud home crowd and create their own momentum, with Vladimir Coufal teeing up Jarrod Bowen for an improvised finish to level the scores just before the interval. After the break, the home side started brightly once more. Bowen proved the livewire in the absence of a central striker, although was booked for diving when Ramsdale raced out of his box to sweep up a long ball in-behind the Arsenal defence. With the game finely-poised, a set-piece was likely to be the difference and so it proved when Gabriel Martinelli crossed for compatriot Gabriel Magalhaes to power in what proved to be the winner ten minutes into the second-half. With a corner cleared, Martinelli reacted first and hung up an inviting cross for his teammate to convert with a crushing header at the back post. Eddie Nketiah twice went close to adding a third but this was a game in which Arteta’s side overcame a major hurdle.

Spurs moved back ahead of Arsenal, albeit possibly temporarily, after Son scored twice in the second half, including a stunning effort into the top corner, against a much-changed Leicester. The South Korean’s first-half corner was headed home by Harry Kane — his 18th goal in 17 appearances against his former loan club — and he twice finished passes from substitute Dejan Kulusevski after the break. Kelechi Iheanacho scored a stoppage-time consolation for the Foxes, who made eight changes ahead of their visit to Roma for Thursday’s Europa Conference League semi-final decider. “I gave him a big hug because after an amazing goal my question was, ‘Which is his favourite foot, right or left?’” Conte said of Son, who scored both goals his his supposedly weaker left foot. “He scored a fantastic goal and three minutes before, when I spoke with him, I said, ‘Go for five or six minutes and then I have to make a change’. “So [after the game] I said to him, ‘You listened that I wanted to make a change and you decide to score this amazing goal!’ “We are talking about a great player, a fantastic player. “But it’s important at the end of the season to celebrate a big achievement with the team. Otherwise it remains only a personal success to score these types of goals.” Spurs moved a point clear of Arsenal, with Conte’s side facing Liverpool at Anfield next weekend and Arsenal playing Leeds, before they meet in a potentially decisive north London derby on May 12. Conte added: “It was a good performance against a really good team. “The game wasn’t easy and we knew very well that despite them making eight changes from the last game against Roma you can see the quality, you can see the squad that Leicester has. “For sure we got three points in an important moment of the season especially because in the next games we are going to face first Liverpool and then Arsenal. “Today it was vital to get three points. There is only one result and a lot of pressure, but I said to my players to live this moment, to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months. “I think no one at the start of the season could imagine Tottenham challenging for a place in the Champions League, especially in November when there was a change [of manager] and for this reason we have to be satisfied that we stay in this position to fight for a big achievement.” Conte also hailed Cristian Romero, who was imperious on the right of Spurs’ back three and helped create their all-important second goal - a close range finish from Son. The Argentine won the ball in a crunching 50-50 with Caglar Soyuncu before Kulusevski slipped in Son. “He played a good game,” the Spurs head coach said. “I think every single player played very well. For us it’s very important to do well with the whole team if we want to get three points. It’s no good to play with one, two or three players playing good. We need the whole team playing well and to find a good balance. When this happens we can win the game.” ",positive,spurs,4

For the majority of a scrappy game, there was little between Spurs and a much-changed Foxes, who are prioritising Thursday’s Europa Conference League decider against Roma, but the hosts’ individual quality told after the break, with Son scoring twice and Romero imperious at centre-half. The South Korean’s second goal was stunning curling effort from the edge of the box to make it 3-0, leaving Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg with his head in his hands, while Harry Kane showed flashes of brilliance and opened the scoring in the first half with his 19th goal in 18 appearances against Leicester. Kelechi Iheanacho scored a stoppage-time consolation for the visitors, who struck the post through Patson Daka at 0-0 but were undone by Son after Brendan Rodgers made eight chances ahead of the trip to Rome. This was not the most polished or convincing display from Antonio Conte’s side but, at this stage of this season, points are the only thing that matter and the win move Spurs one ahead of Arsenal, who face West Ham in the later kick-off. Kane predictability opened the scoring, making it 17 goals in 14 League games against his former loan club, while Son continued to prove that he does not need to be especially involved in games to be the most important player on the pitch. Romero, meanwhile, was outstanding, a class above in everything he did. The Argentine’s ferocious tackling set the tone for Spurs to kick-on in the second half and actually proved an attacking weapon in itself when he won the ball in the crunching challenge on Caglar Soyuncu in the build-up to Son’s all-important second goal. Dejan Kulusevski was also decisive, responding to being rested by coming off the bench and making both of Son’s goals, the first with a clever pass. But Son was really the star, moving ahead of Mohamed Salah for non-penalty goals this season, suggesting he still remains something of an underrated force. Rather than dominating matches, he is increasingly a clutch player in the final third, assisting or scoring when they need a jolt. He set Spurs on their way with a corner for Kane to stoop and score at the near post. If his first goal was a poacher’s finish inside the box, the second goal was inspired, as Son curled into the top corner with his left foot from 20 yards, leaving Kaspar Schmeichel with no chance. This win was an important reminder that while Spurs remain a work in progress under Conte, they have the individuals at both ends of the pitch to win any of their final four matches, even next weekend’s visit to Liverpool, when Kane and Son should relish the space behind the hosts’ high line. A frustration for Conte is that none of his stars had stepped up in the meek displays against Brighton and Brentford, although a Leicester side who are hard-wired to play on the front-foot were also likely to be a more attractive opponent for Conte’s side. While Arsenal are arguably a more well-rounded side than Spurs, further ahead in their development under Mikel Arteta, if this game is anything to go by, Spurs’ individual brilliance and world-class front two could be an important factor in the race for the Champions League.

Premier League result, match stream and latest updates today","ottenham vs Leicester LIVE! Heung-min Son’s stunning goal helped Tottenham get their Champions League hopes back on track with a 3-1 win over Leicester. The South Korean curled a 20-yard effort into the top corner to seal a brace that sees him register his highest tally in a Premier League season, moving to 19 goals - just three behind Mohamed Salah in the race for the Golden Boot. Harry Kane got the ball rolling with his customary goal against the Foxes, heading in a first-half corner for his 19th goal in 18 games against his former loan club. The victory ends a two-game blip and piles the pressure on Arsenal ahead of their game at West Ham as the race for the top four looks increasingly likely to go down to the rearranged north London derby in the penultimate week of the season. It was clear where Leicester’s attention lies, as they made eight changes to the side which drew 1-1 with Roma in the Europa Conference League on Thursday, and they only had a stoppage-time goal from Kelechi Iheanacho to show for their efforts. The pressure is now on Arsenal as Tottenham get their top-four push back on track with a comfortable win. It wasn’t always pretty or polished but individual quality told, specifically Son’s & Romero’s. Having Kulusevski as an impact sub also (perhaps inadvertently) worked very well.

Bergwijn on to replace him for the final ten minutes. Conte knows the job is very much done. STUNNING FROM SON! 20 yards out, onto his left foot and it’s curled perfectly into the top corner. Sensational finish and that will be that. 77 mins: Dier briefly down in some discomfort, but he’s back up and fine to continue. Tielemans on for the visitors - hasn’t got much time left to inspire a big comeback. 74 mins: Spurs increasingly sitting back now, letting Leicester have possession. The front three waiting for any chances to counter though - Kulusevski in particularly looks like he has a point to prove. 71 mins: Royal looks to drill it low across the face of goal... Son was completely free at the back post. Cleared behind for a corner. Son takes the corner, Dier wins the header but it’s straight at Schmeichel. ",positive,spurs,3

After poor results against Brighton and Brentford, Spurs needed a response in their quest for Champions League football. It came in familiar fashion - Harry Kane headed them in front in the first-half, before Heung-min Son fired home his side’s second after the break. Son’s second, and Spurs’ third, came in stunning fashion, as the South Korean curled home a finish into the top corner from 20 yards to cap off a perfect afternoon for the hosts. Kelechi Iheanacho got the visitors on the scoresheet in the dying moments, but any hopes of a comeback had long since gone. It lifts Tottenham back into fourth place in the Premier League, though that will change if Arsenal come away from the London Stadium with three points later on Sunday. Spurs started the better of the two sides but it was a much-changed Leicester side who very nearly took the lead early on as Patson Daka was denied by the woodwork. Cristian Romero then had to make a brilliant interception to stop the Foxes striker having a tap-in at the back post. Despite that strong spell, it was Tottenham who found the opening goal of the match. The Foxes once again were found wanting defending a set-piece, as Son swung in the corner and Kane was there to head home. Spurs’ main man went close to getting his second of the afternoon as he pounced on a loose pass and poked an effort at goal, Kasper Schmeichel doing just about enough to keep it out. After a scrappy start to the second-half, Tottenham took real control of proceedings on the hour mark. Two huge challenges from Cristian Romero set them away, and Dejan Kulusevski then slid the ball through to Son. He turned smartly in the box and fired home with his left foot to double the advantage. Leicester never looked like mounting a comeback but any hopes of one were ended when Son got his second. He picked up the ball, cut inside onto his left and bent a stunning effort into the top corner to put the result beyond any doubt. Iheanacho added a late consolation in stoppage-time, but it did little to dampen the mood on a positive afternoon for Spurs in north London. ",positive,spurs,5
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-conte-levy-psg-b997258.html,Tottenham: Crunch talks with Daniel Levy still key to Antonio Conte’s future despite dismissing PSG rumours,"ntonio Conte has again refused to offer guarantees he will be at Tottenham next season, saying his future will only be decided after a meeting with the club at the end of the campaign. On Friday, Conte dismissed reports he had offered himself to Paris Saint-Germain as “fake news” and “lies”, and it was suggested to him at a later briefing that he could put an end to unwanted speculation over his future by committing to Spurs. But Conte reiterated that he was only focussed on the final five games of the season and would sit down with the club -- meaning chairman Daniel Levy and managing director Fabio Paratici -- to find “the best solution” after the visit to Norwich on May 22. The head coach effectively wants guarantees that Spurs can challenge at the top of the Premier League, saying he deserves “much more” than another scrap for fourth place next season, and suggested his future would depend on whether he has the patience to match the time needed to rebuild the squad. “As I said to [the media] a lot of times, at the end of the season we'll speak with the club but with pleasure, in a really good way,"" Conte said. “We'll speak and try to find the best solution for everybody. This has to be clear. “I repeat: don’t forget I like to have ambition, not only to fight for a place in Champions League or a place in the [Europa] League. Honestly, I want to fight for much more. For much more. I think also I deserve to do this. “It will be very important to understand how much time we need to fight for something important [and] if we have the patience to wait because for sure this is a process. “I always say to you that we need time and patience. And we have to understand how much time we need and how much patience we have. We have to understand this and to understand if we can match my opinion and the club's opinion. “I know very well that in England it is not simple [to win]. First of all, to fight for and to try to win the title is not simple. It’s important to understand also how much time we need if our ambition is to fight to win the title.” Spurs are two points behind fourth-place Arsenal ahead of Sunday's visit of Leicester but host the Gunners on May 12 in what could effectively be a play-off for Champions League football. Daniel Levy “If we are very good to [achieve] this target, it will be a great achievement for the club, for me. It would be important,” Conte added. “With our ambitions for the future, it would be very important, because I think that I deserve to try to fight for and to win trophies and to fight for something important, not for only sixth or seventh, eight place, or if you have a fantastic season, fourth place. Only this. “But I repeat this is my ambition and it is important to understand and fully match the ambition at the time that we need it.” Conte is under contract until the end of next season and the deal is understood to not include a break clause. Pushed on why he could not commit to Spurs, he added: “My answer is always the same and my answer is still the same, to have another answer is not useful for anyone. My opinion didn’t change, my thoughts didn’t change, my ambition didn’t change. I am the same. I have a fantastic relationship with all the people who work here, and with Daniel Levy and Fabio Paratici. “What I said in the past was the truth. We are trying do this season in the best possible way and then we will see.” Conte's comments will put more pressure on Levy to promise the back the Italian but the head coach insisted he is enjoying his role and working under the chairman and Paratici. “I repeat I am enjoying a lot to work here, I have a fantastic relationship with all the people who work here and with Daniel Levy our chairman and Fabio Paratici,” Conte said. “For this reason it is right to at the end to have a good meeting, a private meeting, and to try to find the best solution for everybody. “When you start to stay for a good period in a club and you understand the dynamics, you start to know much better the people that work with you, the environment “And for sure I always said that I am enjoying a lot to work in Tottenham, to stay in Tottenham, and to come to the training ground, to breath this atmosphere. I can speak only well about Tottenham, about the club. For a coach, a manager, it is a good opportunity and you can enjoy your work here.” ",positive,spurs,4

Head of recruitment Carey, who worked remotely and whose role was understood to be less grandiose than his title suggested, had been with Spurs for six years and follows technical performance director Steve Hitchen, who resigned in February, out of the club. “We can confirm that Head of Recruitment Brian Carey has decided to leave his role following six years at the Club. We would like to thank Brian for his work and wish him well for the future,” Tottenham said in a brief statement on Wednesday. Managing director Fabio Paratici is undertaking a thorough revamp of Tottenham’s scouting and recruitment teams and is close to appointing a new No2 to support him in running the football side of the club following Hitchen's exit. Paratici, who had only worked in Italy before joining Spurs, including alongside Antonio Conte at Juventus, wants more specialist knowledge of the English market, although his proposed new deputy is understood to be from overseas. Paratici and Conte have made two new additions at Tottenham so far, recruiting Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur from Turin in January. Paratici’s first summer window in charge saw the arrivals of the likes of Bryan Gil, Emerson Royal, Cristian Romero, Pierluigi Gollini and Pape Sarr. ",positive,spurs,2
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-steven-bergwijn-ajax-transfer-news-b976056.html,Steven Bergwijn: Tottenham demanding higher transfer fee for Dutch winger after Ajax fail with opening bid,"jax are expected to return with an improved bid for Tottenham's Steven Bergwijn after seeing an opening offer of €18million (around £15m) rejected by the Premier League club. Spurs will consider offers for Bergwijn this month but want to recoup closer to the £27m they paid PSV Eindhoven for the winger two years ago. Bergwijn, 24, was the first permanent signing of Jose Mourinho's tenure in January 2020 but could be the first departure under Antonio Conte, if Ajax return with a sufficiently improved offer. Bergwijn, who was born in Amsterdam, came through the ranks at Ajax before joining their rivals PSV in 2011, and is thought to be open to a return to the Eredivisie champions after two frustrating years in the Premier League. Spurs, however, would be reluctant to allow Bergwijn to leave until they have signed a replacement, particularly with Heung-min Son currently sidelined with a hamstring injury until at least the end of the month. Bergwijn made an impressive start at Spurs, scoring in his first three home league games including stunners against both Manchester clubs, but he has since struggled for confidence and fitness. He scored just once last season and opened his account for this term in December's 2-1 win over West Ham in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals, also assisting Lucas Moura's winner. Tottenham will allow Dutch winger Steven Bergwijn to leave the club this month His display earned praise from Conte, who has raised the possibility of Bergwijn deputising for Harry Kane up front when the England captain needs a rest. Bergwijn has not played since Boxing Day due to a calf injury but Conte said before Sunday's 3-1 win over Morecambe he expected to welcome back the Dutch international ""very soon"". Quizzed on Bergwijn’s future at a press conference held before the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg against Chelsea, Conte said: “Honestly, Bergwijn he knows very well what I think about him. I consider him a player that can play in all three roles. As a No9 and as a No10. “For sure, in my period at Tottenham, he was injured for a long time but I showed him that when he’s in a good physical condition, I gave him a chance to show he’s a good player. For sure, Bergwijn is a Tottenham player and he’s very close to coming back. “After the game against Chelsea, he can start having training sessions with us. I count on him. He’s a player with different characteristics to Sonny, Lucas and Harry. He’s very good 1v1, he’s a creative player that we don’t have in our squad.” ",positive,spurs,3

Ajax had a £15million bid for the Netherlands international winger rejected earlier this month but had not given up hope of persuading Spurs to sell. Tottenham were ready to consider offers for Bergwijn at the start of January and allow him to leave if Ajax returned with a sufficiently improved offer. But Antonio Conte has consistently said he wants to keep Bergwijn, even before his memorable heroics in the last-gasp win at Leicester. Bergwijn scored two injury-time goals as Tottenham fought back from 2-1 down to snatch an incredible 3-2 victory at the King Power Stadium, and Spurs hope that dramatic night will help revitalise his career in north London after two frustrating years in the Premier League. Conte has said he believes the 24-year-old can deputise for Harry Kane up front when the England captain needs a rest. And a move for Bergwijn, who was the first permanent signing of Jose Mourinho’s tenure in January 2020, back to the Eredivisie before the transfer deadline has been ruled out. ",positive,spurs,2

Emma Hayes’ side were not at their best against Spurs but Beth England and Kerr’s goals, either side of Kerys Harrop equalising for Spurs, secured them a vital 2-1 win. It means Chelsea are now four points clear of Arsenal at the top of the WSL with two matches to go, although the Gunners have a game in hand. “They (Tottenham) have taken big points off big clubs this year, so we knew it wasn’t going to be easy,” said Kerr. “They’re a good team so it does feel like a good three points, but any win is an important win now. There are two games to go and we’re just going to grind through. If we get all six points we’re champions.” Chelsea’s win last night has put pressure on Arsenal, who are trying to catch the Blues in the final stretch. They have a game in hand on Hayes’ side, which is next Wednesday when they host Tottenham at Emirates Stadium, but before that they will take on Aston Villa on Sunday. Chelsea, meanwhile, are travelling to bottom of the table Birmingham. “We’re in the title race and fighting to be champions. Last season the team was fighting to get third place,” said Arsenal boss Jonas Eidevall. “It’s much more fun to be fighting for the title and if anyone had told us that before the season we would’ve taken it, so let’s enjoy it.” Arsenal will play before Chelsea on Sunday, kicking off at 2pm and four hours earlier than the Blues in the evening. “We just have to control what we can do and get the three points each game and we’re praying Chelsea slip up,” Beth Mead added.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-antonio-conte-top-four-b997102.html,Antonio Conte must use squad to freshen up stale Tottenham after pair of blanks,"ntonio Conte’s view of his Tottenham squad can be summed up by a phrase the head coach has used to explain his reluctance to make substitutions. “I look to the bench, then I look back to the pitch!” Conte has remarked to staff. Conte, in short, is not convinced by his options outside his first XI, and the only changes he has made in 12 matches have been forced by injuries at wing-back. Saturday’s frustrating 0-0 draw with Brentford perfectly demonstrated Conte’s unwillingness to turn to his bench. With Spurs needing a goal to match Arsenal’s earlier win over Manchester United, Conte’s first change was centre-half Davinson Sanchez for Ryan Sessegnon in the 74th minute, while he did not introduce Lucas Moura until four minutes from time. Steven Bergwijn remained unused, which was bizarre in the circumstances, particularly given the Dutchman’s heroics in the last meeting with Sunday’s opponents Leicester, who visit north London on the back of last night’s 1-1 home draw against Roma in the Europa Conference League. Substitute Bergwijn scored twice in stoppage-time as Spurs sensationally won 3-2, despite trailing in the 95th minute, at the King Power Stadium in January. There is a view from some at Spurs that Bergwijn being the match-winner that night may not have been entirely in the club’s best interests. His stunning late show effectively ensured it would be a PR disaster to sell him to Ajax in the final week of January, as Spurs were considering, but he has since played just 175 minutes in the League. Clearly, the club might have been better off selling him and doing a late deal for a wing-back or an attacker Conte really rates. The big issue with Conte’s reluctance to use his full squad is that his first XI quickly ran out of ideas and steam in the matches against Brighton and Brentford and, damningly, Spurs go into Sunday having not had a shot on target for over three hours. Graham Potter’s Seagulls may just have established a blueprint with which to stop Conte’s side — specifically, prevent Harry Kane from getting on the ball and deny the England captain, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski space in the final third. For all their encouraging progress under Conte, Spurs are still not much better at creating chances against canny opponents as they were under Jose Mourinho. Their wins over Leeds, Everton and West Ham came against sides who all adopted a gung-ho approach, while the thrashings of Aston Villa and Newcastle came after they had been outplayed in the first half but managed to establish a lead, before picking off an opponent who had to chase the game. Until he can make those signings, establishing a Plan B would be a start, but Conte is committed to his approach and appears reluctant to experiment. Among his options would be a switch to a back-four, with Bergwijn or Moura coming in at the expense of a defender, but this risks Spurs’ defensive solidity, which has remained intact. A more realistic move would be to bring either of the above into the front three and move Kulusevski to right wing-back, where the injured Matt Doherty is a miss, as Conte did for the final few minutes against Brentford. The risk there is that the connection between the midfield two and front three is further disrupted without link-man Kulusevski drifting between the thirds. Adding an extra midfield body in Harry Winks is another possibility. The good news for Conte is that Spurs’ next three opponents — Leicester, Liverpool and Arsenal — all have coaches who prefer their teams to have possession and play on the front foot, which should suit the Italian’s approach of absorbing pressure and attacking the space. Conte, though, cannot continue to rely on opponents playing into his team’s hands if Spurs are to overhaul Arsenal again in the battle for fourth. ",positive,spurs,9
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-lo-celso-villarreal-conte-b996508.html,Giovani Lo Celso transformed at Villarreal as Antonio Conte proved right after Tottenham struggle,"f all the supposed Premier League rejects, misfits and cast-offs who make up Unai Emery's Villarreal squad against Liverpool tonight, none feel as important to their hopes of another Champions League upset as Tottenham loanee Giovani Lo Celso. Lo Celso has added guile and grit to Emery's midfield and was outstanding as Villarreal eliminated first Juventus then Bayern Munich in the knockouts. Lo Celso was man of the match in the 1-0 win over Bayern in the quarter-final first leg, and pivotal again in the subsequent 1-1 draw in Germany, playing both games with a fizzing intensity which the Bundesliga giants found difficult to contain. He got the pre-assist for both the Yellow Submarine's goals across the tie. The performances could scarcely have been more contrasting to Lo Celso's limp efforts in his final months at Spurs, when the simplest of tasks looked beyond him and supporters grew increasingly exasperated with his inability to impact matches. The Argentine's turnaround since returning to Spain on January deadline day has not come entirely out of the blue, however, but rather feels like the result of a talented player being back in an environment which suits him. Giovani Lo Celso has revitalised his career since leaving Tottenham for Villarreal on a loan deal in January This is certainly the view of Spurs boss Antonio Conte, who regards the midfielder as gifted but ill-suited to the intensity and physicality of English football and judged that he needed to be playing regularly back on the continent. Conte has a point. Lo Celso enjoys dribbling and likes to release the ball late, when he has drawn in an opponent and space has opened up ahead, making him susceptible to challenges. His pass in the build-up to Samuel Chukwueze's decisive goal at Bayern was a good example. In LaLiga and the Champions League, Lo Celso is afforded more time and is said to feel more protected, and therefore more comfortable, than in English football. Before joining Spurs he had practically never been injured but two-and-a-half years of hard knocks in England led to a succession of niggles and more serious complaints, which sapped his confidence and disrupted his rhythm. His commitment to playing for his country, even while Argentina was on the UK's ""red list"" of travel destinations, further contributed to his stop-start season at Spurs and frustrated the club, particularly given the view that Lo Celso was the ringleader in September, when he, Cristian Romero and Davinson Sanchez reported for international duty against the club's wishes and subsequently spent 10 days training in Croatia to avoid a spell in quarantine. That said, Conte's predecessors Jose Mourinho and Mauricio Pochettino admired Lo Celso, and he looked more than capable of playing in England during Project Restart, when he was the heartbeat of Mourinho's improving Tottenham side. While many at Spurs found Lo Celso stand-offish, Mourinho liked his quiet determination and said in July 2020 he would not swap him for ""any player"". Last season, injuries and a loss of form largely reduced Lo Celso to the role of alternate for Tanguy Ndombele, who could rarely maintain his intensity for longer than an hour, and Mourinho's seeming lack of trust in him continued under Conte. Lo Celso spent last season at Spurs as an alternate for the disappointing Tanguy Ndombele By contrast, Emery, who managed Lo Celso at Paris Saint-Germain, has placed enormous faith in the 26-year-old, and regards him as a tactically intelligent player who can carry out specific jobs. Lo Celso has quickly become the leader of Villarreal's defensive press, and he is expected to play off the right in tonight's semi-final first leg to deal with the threat of left-back Andy Robertson, just as he did so successfully against Bayern. While Lo Celso's lack of a defined position was a problem at Spurs, Emery enjoys his versatility and will move him around during matches to suit the situation. There is also a view that Lo Celso may prefer being a bigger fish in a smaller pond, having struggled at PSG and Spurs but shone for Real Betis and Villarreal, who are seventh in LaLiga and will need to win the Champions League to return to the competition next season. Villarreal are desperate to keep Lo Celso but his loan deal does not include an obligation to buy at the end of the season, and Spurs want to recoup as much of the £55million fee they paid Betis as possible. Villarreal have never spent more than £21m on a player and are likely to push for another loan deal. Given Lo Celso’s impact for Villarreal, Spurs could find he has no shortage of suitors in the summer One intriguing hypothetical would be the return of Pochettino from PSG to north London in a job swap with Conte, which has been mooted this week. Lo Celso was signed on Pochettino's watch and he may be more open to keeping his compatriot than Conte. Given Lo Celso's impact for Villarreal, Spurs could find he has no shortage of suitors in the summer, however, particularly if he impresses again at Anfield tonight. ",positive,spurs,11

Having watched top four rivals Arsenal beat Manchester United earlier on Saturday, Spurs knew the pressure was on. They looked devoid of all attacking creativity and for the second successive game they failed to have a shot on target. It could have been even worse as Ivan Toney was denied by the woodwork twice as Brentford almost made it four wins in a row. Tottenham’s front three of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski were again blunted and it looks as if Spurs, who had scored a glut of goals in recent weeks, have been found out.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-antonio-conte-psg-links-fake-news-b997170.html,Tottenham boss Antonio Conte dismisses PSG links as ‘fake news’ and ‘lies’,"ottenham boss Antonio Conte has rubbished reports he has offered himself to Paris Saint-Germain, calling them “fake news” and “lies”. It had been suggested that the Italian was interested in taking over from Mauricio Pochettino at the French champions this summer, raising the possibility of a job swap that would have seen the Argentine return to north London. Conte’s contract runs until the end of next season but he has repeatedly said he will discuss his future with the club at the end of the campaign, with Spurs currently locked in a battle with rivals Arsenal for fourth place. When asked about the PSG links on Friday, Conte said: “Obviously I think that it's good that other clubs appreciate my work. This is one thing. But the truth is that I don't like when people try to invest news, only to speak, only to create probnlems. “This is not right, not fair for me, for the clubs involved and for my players. “Also because we're really focussed on these five games to get a fantastic result for us. I repeat, this type of situation makes me smile. “But I think that also the people that want to tell something about this have to show respect for all the people involved in this situation, and not invent fake news and tell a lot of lies.” Asked if he had spoken to his players about the reports, Conte added: “In this situation, who works in football - players or managers - know very well that at this point of the season, a lot of fake news starts to go out. “We're working very hard and my players know very well we're very focused. We're speaking a lot about this opportunity. “We have to live this situation with passion, enthusiasm and joy. I repeat, we deserve to stay there and to fight for a place in the Champions League. A place in Champions League is not easy for no one. “To stay there, we need to enjoy this situation. For this reason, I repeat our fans have to stay with us at every moment. Positive and negative moments. “We deserve to fight until the end and have a big push from our fans.” Conte’s Spurs have slipped two points behind Arsenal with five games to play after losing to Brighton and last weekend’s frustrating draw with Brentford. Ahead of Leicester’s visit on Sunday, he issued a rallying cry to his players and supporters to keep pushing in the final five games. “I want to underline that we’re fighting for a target that, at the start of the season, no one could imagine,” Conte said. “Especially in November because when I arrived the situation wasn’t good - otherwise you wouldn’t change the coach. So to arrive with five games to go with the possibility to get this result is a great achievement for us. “So for this reason, we have to face the situation with great enthusiasm because we have nothing to lose and only to earn. “We are doing something special for the situation we faced this season. I spoke with my players and it’s the same with our fans, they have to continue to support us and push us until the end. “We’re living this dream. We have to continue until the end to get a place in the Champions League. It’s right to underline that we are fighting for a target that wasn’t in our mind at the start of the season. “For this reason I want to push everybody at the club to have great enthusiasm, great passion, our fans to stay with us and to back us from the start until the end. “If we reach this target, all the people in Tottenham have to be happy to reach this target and everybody has to be involved to meet this target.” ",positive,spurs,2
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-spurs-levy-summer-conte-transfers-b996593.html,Tottenham: Daniel Levy facing huge summer dilemma as Antonio Conte plots transfer overhaul,"aniel Levy is experienced enough to brush off speculation and is used to ignoring noise from his managers, but employing Antonio Conte must occasionally test the Tottenham chairman’s patience. This week, in the wake of Spurs’ frustrating stalemate with Brentford which dented their chances of returning to the Champions League, a fresh round of reports linked Conte with a summer exit, with the head coach rumoured to be interested in succeeding Mauricio Pochettino at Paris Saint-Germain. They raised the intriguing prospect of a sensational job swap between Conte and Pochettino, but Levy will surely be growing exasperated with Conte’s quit threats and rumours of his interest in other jobs — even if the Italian’s camp insist the PSG stories did not come from them. While Pochettino’s likely dismissal by PSG offers Levy an attractive safety net in the event that Conte walks at the end of the season, the danger for the chairman is a repeat of last summer, which he spent searching for a new manager and battling with Harry Kane over his future. These concerns are part of the package in employing Conte, who is notoriously high maintenance and described by one senior figure at Chelsea as making Jose Mourinho “look like a pussycat”. The hard-to-please coach will always demand more and his rhetoric should be viewed, at least in part, as a means of pressuring the club to give him what he wants. Clearly, there is an argument that Levy and managing director Fabio Paratici should do whatever possible to appease Conte in the transfer market this summer. Given Tottenham’s position in the food chain, the chairman may never again have one of the world’s top coaches, at the very peak of his powers, in his employ, and for all the (justified) talk of Pochettino being a better profile of manager for the club, backing Conte still feels like Spurs’ best chance of real success next season. For Levy, it is not quite so simple, though. Conte’s short-term contract, which runs until the end of next season, and his apparent concerns that Spurs do not have the means to compete for the League title, mean Levy and Paratici will have to be particularly careful to sign players who suit both Conte and the club this summer. As Saturday’s draw demonstrated, Conte is rigidly committed to his preferred system and, if he stays in north London, he wants at least six new players — among them two wing-backs and a left-sided centre-half who can play in a back three. He also favours experienced, senior players. Should Daniel Levy back Antonio Conte in the transfer market, knowing he could walk away from Tottenham? Conte tends to leave clubs in a better condition than he finds them but Levy will still be wary of backing the head coach to the tune of millions of pounds on specialist players when there remains a danger he could walk away as soon as he gets a more attractive offer, or at the end of his contract. Levy has already showed an admirable willingness to back Conte, offloading the club’s record signings, Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso, for nothing in January, and signing Dejan Kulusevski — a former Conte target at Inter Milan — and Rodrigo Bentancur from Juventus. Completely reshaping the squad in Conte’s image, however, poses long-term risks while his position and future remain uncertain, so Levy and Paratici must tread carefully. Liverpool’s rebuild under Jurgen Klopp, by contrast, was made easier by his long-term commitment to the club, ensuring they could sign players to suit the German’s approach. Manchester City have done the same with Pep Guardiola but Spurs are disadvantaged both by being more financially prudent than their rivals in the market, and having a rigid tactician whose future is not certain. Spurs have already spent £50million on a centre-half who excels in a back three and spending the same again on a left-footed version of Cristian Romero may not suit, say, Pochettino, who prefers playing a four-man defence (and might have also been happy to work with Lo Celso and Ndombele, as another example). It might be in Conte’s interests to start showing some commitment to Spurs, starting with a new deal The success of Kulusevski and Bentancur offer reasons for optimism, proving that Paratici can find targets to suit the club’s policy of young, versatile players while still satisfying Conte, but this summer will certainly test the relationship between the two Italians, and Levy’s willingness to cede control over big deals to the pair. Paradoxically, in pushing Spurs to back him with a drip-drip of hints and threats, Conte has arguably made it harder for the club to give him everything he wants. It might be in Conte’s interests to start showing some commitment to Spurs, starting with a new deal, if he is to convince the club to go full-throttle behind his vision. ",positive,spurs,8

Spurs have five matches before the end of January, with League One Morecambe the visitors in the FA Cup third round on Sunday before the second leg against Chelsea on Wednesday night. They also play European rivals Arsenal, Leicester and Chelsea in the league before the end of the month. “The day after [the Chelsea game], he felt a bit of pain in his muscle, in his leg,” Conte said of Son. “He had a scan and now we have to make the right evaluation from the doctors. He has an injury. I don’t know, but probably he will stay without training sessions until the end of this cycle, for the international break.” In a separate interview with Spurs TV, Conte clarified that Son was expected to be sidelined for around two weeks. The Italian plans to rest Harry Kane against the Shrimps this weekend and rotate his side, but it is unclear who will deputise up front, with Steven Bergwijn, who Conte has previously touted for the role of Kane’s understudy, also injured. “Honestly, Harry played six games in 17 days,” Conte said. “And I think if I have the possibility, I think it’s right to give him a bit of a rest. “Also because after this game, before the international break, we have four games, very difficult games. Chelsea, Arsenal, Leicester and then Chelsea again. It’s always difficult to think, to decide not to start with Harry. But at the same time, in some games if we can take the risk it’s right to take.

To expect anything in the way of wholesale changes during the arduous January market would be too much, although Conte is a man who does need satisfying. Having constantly spoken about needing to raise the level of the team, surely Spurs will be doing all they can to back him during what remains of this month. At least showing Conte there’s a chance to grow and a readiness to provide him with fresh options is of the utmost importance. If the the Italian does not feel there’s a willingness to rebuild the squad, perhaps the former Chelsea boss’ frustration will grow. With that in mind, here’s a look at the latest on Spurs’ transfer gossip. SPONSORED According to Fabrizio Romano, Spurs and Newcastle United have had loan offers for the forward snubbed. While Martial is believed to be looking for a way out of Old Trafford, it seems his future could lie abroad. Sevilla, Barcelona and Juventus are all said to be keen in what must be a blow for Spurs given Conte has called for a new addition in that department. Dan Kilpatrick has previously reported that Fabio Paratici is actively looking to sell the midfielder. Conte has been rather cutting in his assessment of the Frenchman and, after being booed off against Morecambe in the FA Cup, it’s very hard to see a way back for him. Still, finding a buyer this month is likely to be difficult. Perhaps the major name to have been linked with Spurs this month, Wolves have snubbed a £15m offer for the player and are holding out for £20m, It remains to be seen if Spurs will go that far. Given Pierluigi Gollini has barely covered himself in glory and Hugo Lloris is yet to extend his contract, a new goalkeeper could be needed at Spurs.

Kai Havertz’s early strike and a Ben Davies own goal set the Blues on course for a day out at Wembley - although they must first navigate a tricky trip to North London to face old boss Antonio Conte. While Chelsea cruised past Chesterfield in the third-round of the FA Cup on Saturday, Spurs were forced into a late comeback to defeat League One side Morecambe in their tie. That result crystalised the size of the task Conte faces at Tottenham, who squeezed past Watford and drew at Southampton before the two cup matches. Without a trophy since their 2008 League Cup triumph, the pressure is on Spurs to mount a famous comeback whereas Champions League holders Chelsea last won this competition seven years ago. Tottenham vs Chelsea is scheduled for a 7.45m GMT kick-off on Wednesday, January 12, 2022. Tottenham Stadium in London will host the match. TV channel: The match will be televised on Sky Sports Premier League and Football. Live stream: Sky Sports subscribers will be able to watch the match online via the Sky Go app. Live blog: You can follow up-to-the-minute updates from the match on Standard Sport’s LIVE blog. Conte made eight changes to his regular XI for the win over Morecambe, the nature of which suggests he will return to his starters on Wednesday night. Son Heung-min (leg) and Cristian Romero (hamstring) are out with Steven Bergwijn (foot) and Eric Dier (illness) doubts after missing the weekend’s game. Thomas Tuchel may be able to welcome N’Golo Kante and Thiago Silva back to the Chelsea team after their Covid-19 absence. Reece James and Trevoh Chalobah (both hamstring) are set to miss out along with Ben Chilwell (knee) and Edouard Mendy (AFCON). Cesar Azpilicueta (thigh) should be fit while the Blues could continue with youngsters Lewis Hall and Harvey Vale in their squad after runouts against Chesterfield. Chelsea’s ruthless edge shone through in last season’s Champions League run and it is clear to see that Tottenham are far from the finished product under Conte. With the aggregate score the only one that counts, the Blues should see this one through. If the tie is level at full-time, extra-time and penalties will be used with away goals not a factor in this competition. A 1-1 draw (3-1 to Chelsea on aggregate). Chelsea have not lost in 90 minutes in nine meetings with Tottenham. Tottenham wins: 55 Draws: 41 Chelsea wins: 75 ",positive,spurs,2
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-ledley-king-mural-b975882.html,Ledley King: 25-foot tall mural of Tottenham legend unveiled to ‘open a new chapter in Spurs history’,"giant mural of Ledley King has been unveiled outside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The 25-foot-high artwork pays tribute to the Tottenham legend, a one-club man who made more than 250 appearances for the club and captained Spurs to their last trophy in 2008. The mural on Tottenham High Road features King and his inspirational quote: “This is my club, my one and only club”. The Tottenham Hotspur Supporters’ Trust [THST], who commissioned and part-funded the artwork with the help of the club, said it “opens a new chapter in Spurs history”. “It is, we hope, the first of a number of initiatives that make the history of Tottenham Hotspur more visible in the area around the stadium and more widely around Haringey,” said THST in a statement. On seeing the completed mural for the first time, King said: “It is a true honour for me to have a tribute like this in the heart of a community that means so much to me. “I have always shared an incredible relationship with the club and its fans, who have supported me through thick and thin. “To know that I am thought of in this way by our fans makes me incredibly proud and shows why this club – my one and only club - is so special.” THST board member Rob White said: “Murals are a great way of being able to raise awareness of great players, and great moments. “It’s taken about 18 months. We started with identifying potential sites, finding out who owned them, then looking to get permission for the project. For a variety of reasons, this is not as simple as it sounds. Especially when introducing a relatively new concept to an area. The hope is that once this first mural is in place, other people will come forward with suitable sites. “We had a meeting with Ledley and Tony Stevens from the club at the end of November 2021, where we put the idea to Ledley and showed him the concepts. It’s fair to say that he was delighted and humbled by the idea. “I also think that it’s quite an abstract concept when you are first approached for something like this, but then it all becomes a bit more focused when you see the scale of the project. It’s also really nice for Ledley to think that this fans tribute will be in place for a long time. “The club has been extremely supportive of the project, and they have really got behind the Ledley mural. I know that this project has inspired them, and that they’re looking to use this experience to build on some more heritage and Spurs history ideas in the local area. “This is a response to the calls to pay tribute to club legends. It’s also a really good way of engaging with the local community. “The long-term vision is to have about 10 to 12 pieces of Spurs history artwork throughout Haringey, which help to tell the story of the club. “The pieces do not all need to be the size of the Ledley mural but could form part of a history/heritage trail and some could also tell the stories of the lesser-known characters. This could be funded by various fan groups, overseas or in the UK, who would then decide on who or what they wanted to see.” ",positive,spurs,4
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-morecambe-harry-winks-b975830.html,Tottenham players held ‘harsh and honest’ inquest in dressing room after ‘sloppy’ first half against Morecambe,"arry Winks has revealed that Tottenham’s players conducted a ""harsh and honest"" inquest in the dressing room at half-time before their late FA Cup salvage job against Morecambe. Spurs survived a major scare as they rallied and scored three goals in the final 16 minutes to come from behind and see off the League One strugglers 3-1 on Sunday. Tottenham laboured, particularly in the first half, until Antonio Conte called for the cavalry and introduced Harry Kane, Lucas Moura and Oliver Skipp in the 69th minute. Winks equalised with a free-kick five minutes later before Lucas put Spurs ahead and Kane then sealed victory. Winks said it was disappointing that Tottenham’s second-string needed to be bailed out by their star forwards again after a display that he said “wasn’t good enough”. ""There is disappointment, it wasn’t good enough,” said Winks. “It was sloppy. We weren't sharp or aggressive enough. We didn't play with enough pressure or intensity. We could have upped our game a lot. “At half-time, there was a lot of harsh and honest words said. It wasn’t good enough and we know that. We hold ourselves accountable. We did better in the second half than the first, but it's not good enough. “These are the kinds of games where in the first 10 or 15 minutes, you need to settle everybody, settle the crowd and then enjoy the game. We made an enjoyable afternoon into a tough one. We shouldn't have done that. “We got the result, we got the win, it's nothing to be too happy about because we made it difficult for ourselves and we shouldn't really celebrate. We should be looking back and seeing what we can do better.” ",positive,spurs,2
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-steven-bergwijn-harry-kane-antonio-conte-b969598.html,Tottenham boss Antonio Conte puts faith in Steven Bergwijn as Harry Kane understudy during packed fixture list,"ntonio Conte has offered Steven Bergwijn the chance to revive his Tottenham career by becoming Harry Kane’s understudy at centre-forward. Spurs begin a gruelling run of ten games in 30 days with Thursday night’s home derby against Brentford and Conte has confirmed that Kane, the club’s only senior striker, is unlikely to start them all. Bergwijn has struggled for consistency since joining Spurs from PSV Eindhoven in January 2020 and the winger has been linked with a return to the Eredivisie next month. Under Conte's predecessors, Heung-min Son typically deputised for Kane through the middle, but the Italian wants to keep Son at No10 and revealed he is prepping Bergwijn to play up front. Asked by Standard Sport if Kane would need to be rested this month, Conte said: “I think so and I also think Steven could be a good option [to deputise]. ""In the past I have seen that Son played No9. Honestly, I prefer Son to play as a No10 – in the position that he is now playing. I like to have a point of reference as No9. Steven is working and we are utilising him also in this position [and] in the three positions off the striker. Steven could be a good option on the day that I want to give a rest to Harry.” Bergwijn scored on his first three home appearances in England, including crackers against both Manchester clubs, but his confidence appeared to drain after he missed a glorious chance in the 2-1 defeat at Liverpool in December – which triggered Spurs' slide down the table. He has scored just once for Spurs since the start of last season but Conte says the Netherlands international – who helped his country qualify for the World Cup with a brilliant goal last month – is not alone in lacking confidence. “I honestly think many players have to recover their confidence at Tottenham,” the head coach said. “When you finish the season in seventh, for sure the confidence is not up. This is another aspect we’re working on – to improve [players’] confidence."" Conte added: “[In Steven] we're talking about a player that has important skills. It was a pity for me – but not the [Dutch] national team, because he scored in qualifying – because I would have liked to have him during the two weeks of the international break to work with him and know him much better. “But for sure he has great quality. He's good one-v-one, he's fast, he can beat a man and also score. He's understanding what I want from him. Tonight, he’s ready and available – and I’m counting on him.” Kane has started all four matches under Conte, including the embarrassing defeat to NS Mura last week, and he was named in the XI for Sunday’s postponed visit to Burnley. Getting the best out of the England captain remains one of Conte’s most pressing challenges, with Kane still having scored just once in 11 League appearances. Conte, though, has no doubts about Kane’s enduring quality and says he has only been able to truly appreciate his “level” since working with him at close quarters. “We have a world-class striker as a No9 in Harry and I am very delighted to have the opportunity to work with him because many times you make an evaluation [of a player from] outside [the club],” Conte said. “But only when the coach has the possibility to train players, do you understand their level. With Harry, I was enthusiastic to see him in the way that he works every day and the commitment, heart and passion that he puts into Tottenham. It was not a surprise but when you arrive you do not know what you find. And I found this.” Conte will be without Argentine pair Cristian Romero and Giovani Lo Celso against the Bees, and could name the same XI which was due to start at Burnley before snow forced an 11th-hour delay.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-steven-bergwijn-goal-antonio-conte-b977709.html,Steven Bergwijn’s Lucas Moura ‘Ajax moment’ could be a springboard for the Antonio Conte era at Tottenham,"eep into stoppage time at the King Power, Tottenham were on course for another one of those nights, the kind that has come to typify their season. They had struck the woodwork, had two efforts heroically cleared off the line, missed several more clear-cut chances, yet at the end of it all, were on course to be undone by two Leicester goals that owed much to defensive passivity and misfortune. Sergio Reguilon’s tackle had fallen kindly for Patson Daka to open the scoring, then Japhet Tanganga’s attempted block took James Maddison’s effort past Hugo Lloris after Harry Kane had equalised. An unbeaten start to life under Antonio Conte in the Premier League - the saving grace and great cause for optimism amid a meagre Carabao Cup semi-final defeat and a controversial European exit - was about to go up in smoke. And then came Steven Bergwijn, with a late cameo that evoked memories of Lucas Moura against Ajax, scoring goals in the 95th and 97th minutes to give Spurs a victory that will be celebrated perhaps as much as any in the turbulent years since. The Dutchman, on as a substitute after Maddison’s strike had put the Foxes back ahead, smashed home from close range after Matt Doherty’s effort was blocked, then paid homage to Lucas in the Johan Cruyff Arena with a reverse-finish that slid agonisingly past a stranded keeper so unfathomably late in the day you feared the referee’s whistle might blow before it had time to cross the line. The famous 3-2 in Amsterdam provided the greatest night of Mauricio Pochettino’s era and, at last, Antonio Conte will feel that, in a victory on the road by the same scoreline, his own has its springboard. For were it not for the late drama, this would have been a defeat difficult for the Italian to take not because of his team’s inadequacies, but because of how much they had impressed. Despite starting with a midfield trio that, on paper, possessed about as much flair as a box of Bran Flakes, Spurs produced their most incisive attacking display for some time and could conceivably have scored five by half-time. Much of that owed to an improved performance from Kane and the return of Sergio Reguilon. Having Reguilon back from injury mercifully allowed Conte to call time on his experiment with Doherty as a left-wing-back and his presence made all the difference to Spurs as an attacking force. The Spaniard linked nicely with Kane and Lucas and brought a directness in the final-third that has been lacking during Doherty’s brief stint as deputy, the Irishman forever slowing attacks out of the necessity of checking back onto his right-foot. Earmarked as one of the players who could most benefit from Conte’s arrival, Reguilon’s stock has risen further as understudies have faltered during his absence and if Spurs can bring similar thrust to the opposite flank it will ease the burden on a midfield not blessed with creativity. To his credit, Doherty was much-improved returning to his preferred position on the right as a half-time replacement for the ineffectual Emerson Royal, but a good 45 minutes will have done little convince Conte he is the solution, against a hefty backcatalogue of work that suggests he is not. As for Kane, the Carabao Cup matches against Chelsea had represented a backwards step, after he had looked close to rediscovering his best form when scoring in three successive Premier League games in December. The England captain was a lumbering, peripheral figure stranded on halfway for much of that two-legged tie as Thomas Tuchel’s side held Spurs at arm’s length for the best part of 180 minutes. Given his goalscoring record against Arsenal, he must have been as frustrated as anyone to see Sunday’s derby fall by the wayside, but Leicester have proved even more fruitful opposition over the years and the 28-year-old put those Chelsea regressions behind him with a threatening, domineering display, the spearhead of a Spurs attack that looked as potent as it has all season, particularly before the break. His composed equaliser on 39 minutes came after he had already headed against the bar and been denied by Luke Thomas on the line, and took his tally against the Foxes to 18 in 17 career league appearances. As the clock ticked beyond 90 minutes, though, it still looked like it would be his failure to make it 19 when slid clean-through by Lucas at 1-1 that would prove decisive. That was until deep into stoppage time, when he in turn sent Bergwijn clear to ensure it, in fact, did not matter one jot. ",positive,spurs,6

Deadline Day is over with Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United making no significant additions to their squads. Tottenham had a busy day, with Juventus duo Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur becoming the first signings of the Antonio Conte era, while Tanguy Ndombele completed his return to Lyon on loan, Giovani Lo Celso went to Villarreal and Dele Alli joined Everton in a dramatic late deal. Arsenal have not added to their ranks, beyond Auston Trusty who will stay at Colorado Rapids, despite reports linking them to moves for Alvaro Morata and Alexander Isak, but did see a further departure. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang joined Barcelona on a free transfer, with an announcement expected on Tuesday morning. Ousmane Dembele was linked with both Chelsea and Manchester United in recent days, with reports suggesting a move to PSG has broken down, but will stay at Barcelona. Meanwhile, Kylian Mbappe is said to have decided to join Real Madrid. SPONSORED Liverpool have already secured Luis Diaz, and tried to make late swoop for Fulham’s Fabio Carvalho, but could not complete the move in time. There were no incomings as expected at Crystal Palace, though they have made Jean-Philippe Mateta’s move a permanent one. Donny van de Beek has joined Everton, while West Ham‘s hopes of re-signing Jesse Lingard are over, with Man United not willing to let him leave this month. Newcastle have signed Brighton defender Dan Burn before the deadline but their move for Hugo Ekitike has collapsed. In the other major done deals of the day, Manchester City have landed Julian Alvarez, Rangers have signed Aaron Ramsey on loan and Christian Eriksen has joined Brentford for six months. Follow transfer deadline day LIVE with Standard Sport’s blog below! It’s been a long month and there’s been plenty to keep track of in the Premier League. Dele Alli to Everton, Christian Eriksen to Brentford and Philippe Coutinho were some of the most notable moves made. Here’s a full list of every incoming deal made by top-flight clubs in the January window. Just 16 months after signing a lucrative three-year contract and vowing to become an Arsenal legend, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left under a cloud, writes Simon Collings. Aubameyang was exiled by Mikel Arteta after being stripped of the captaincy following a disciplinary breach that ultimately led to a sad end to his time at Emirates Stadium. He has not played a minute since December, was dropped from the squad and Arteta said he failed to demonstrate the “commitment and passion” to play for the club. Clearly, their relationship was broken beyond repair. Read the full story here on the long-term thinking behind Arsenal’s bold decision. It’s the one we’ve been waiting for! Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s free transfer to Barcelona has officially been confirmed by Arsenal. Aubameyang was pictured arriving in Barcelona on Monday lunchtime, when the clubs were in talks over a potential loan move, but as reports emerged that the deal had broken down it was suggested he had only been in the Spanish city to visit family. However, the deal was revived late in the day as a permanent transfer, signalling the end of the forward’s Arsenal career. Read the full story here. Arsenal’s January transfer window was a tale of frustration and, ultimately, the failure to strengthen the squad will ramp up the pressure to spend in the summer, writes Standard Sport’s Simon Collings. Mikel Arteta was bullish throughout last month about the need for Arsenal to “maximise every window” and, while that may have been the case with outgoings, it wasn’t so with incomings. Read the full story. Chelsea have confirmed the signing of Mason Burstow from Charlton, with the teenager heading back to the Valley on loan. Read the full story. Dele Alli paid special tribute to Mauricio Pochettino as he bid farewell to Tottenham after seven years at the club. Everton signed the midfielder on an initial free transfer, which could reach £30million, on transfer deadline day. It ended Dele’s long association with Spurs, and he thanked the club and fans for their support. Notably, former boss Pochettino and his staff were thanked for their “trust and guidance” during the early part of his career in North London. He wrote on social media: “It’s the end of the chapter but not the book. Thank you all for the messages.” Read the full story. Newcastle confirm the loan exit of Jack Young to Wycombe on loan. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was pictured in Barcelona kit for the first time on Tuesday - as he underwent a training session before his move from Arsenal was officially announced.

Thomas Tuchel was left frustrated by the failure to cover Chelsea’s injury crisis during the January window, writes Standard Sport’s James Robson. But the German – who warned the season could be wrecked if no mid-season additions were made – will be boosted by the return of Reece James, Andreas Christensen and Trevoh Chalobah this month. Tuchel’s main priority was always to bring in longer-term targets if they became available in January. And the focus will be on stamping more of his mark on the squad in the summer, with a host names already identified. Read the full story. Barcelona president Joan Laporta has claimed that Ousmane Dembele has already found his next club after rejecting a move to the Premier League on deadline day. Chelsea were strongly linked with the French winger, who was available for a move after negotiations over a new Barcelona contract collapsed. Instead, he will now leave as a free agent in the summer. “The Dembele thing is difficult to understand,” Laporta told a press conference on Tuesday. “Dembele is in the team and Xavi has to build a competitive squad with players who have a future at this club. “We think that Dembele already has a contract with another club, they have insinuated that to us.

Valencia confirmed the deal with only a few hours remaining before the deadline, and deployed a Harry Potter-style teaser clip to introduce their floppy-haired new star. Surprisingly popping up was Potter actor Oliver Phelps, who played George Weasley in the film series. “I’ve seen some amazing magic come out of London,” he said in Los Che’s Twitter announcement clip. “But this time, it’s a magician on the wing! “Destination: The most magical temple on earth, the Mestalla.

On Monday, Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur arrived from Juventus, leading to the club allowing Spaniard Gil to return to his homeland. The winger underwent his medical for a loan move until the summer at Monday lunchtime. Reports in Spain indicate that Valencia will not pay a fee for his temporary switch, while it is also understood that no fee has been agreed for a permanent switch. The 20-year-old failed to score a goal and provided only one assist in his 20 appearances for Tottenham, since signing from Sevilla in a deal involving around £20million and Erik Lamela last summer.

The deal would see Dele initially head to Goodison Park on a free transfer, with a £10m fee due to Tottenham after he makes 20 appearances. The fee could eventually rise to £30m depending on performance. The Toffees confirmed Frank Lampard as their new manager on Monday afternoon and within hours of his appointment the former Chelsea boss was hopeful of making Dele his first official signing. Everton have already wrapped up the loan signing of Donny van de Beek from Manchester United, with Lampard's approval. Spurs were expecting to loan out Dele this month but Everton used their final loan spot on Van de Beek and can only pursue a permanent deal. Dele joined Spurs from MK Dons in summer 2015 and established himself as one of the most exciting young players in Europe but he gradually fallen from favour in the last few years, and struggled under all three managers since Mauricio Pochettino was sacked. Newcastle were expected to come in for Dele this month but that never materialised. He has made just seven Premier League appearances for Tottenham this season and Antonio Conte made it clear he was available for transfer in January. In total, Dele has played 269 games for Spurs and scored 67 goals. ",positive,spurs,3

Tanguy Ndombele has completed a loan move to Lyon, while Dele Alli is discussing a permanent move to Everton and Villarreal are in talks with Giovani Lo Celso. Major targets had routinely rejected a move to North London before the Juve duo arrived; Adama Traore, Dusan Vlahovic, and Luis Diaz opting for moves elsewhere despite Tottenham interest. But Conte will hope that Kulusevski and Bentancur can inject fresh life into his squad, which are only fighting on two fronts after being kicked out of Europe and losing to Chelsea in the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup.

Premier League result, match stream and latest updates today","ottenham vs Leicester LIVE! Heung-min Son’s stunning goal helped Tottenham get their Champions League hopes back on track with a 3-1 win over Leicester. The South Korean curled a 20-yard effort into the top corner to seal a brace that sees him register his highest tally in a Premier League season, moving to 19 goals - just three behind Mohamed Salah in the race for the Golden Boot. Harry Kane got the ball rolling with his customary goal against the Foxes, heading in a first-half corner for his 19th goal in 18 games against his former loan club. The victory ends a two-game blip and piles the pressure on Arsenal ahead of their game at West Ham as the race for the top four looks increasingly likely to go down to the rearranged north London derby in the penultimate week of the season. It was clear where Leicester’s attention lies, as they made eight changes to the side which drew 1-1 with Roma in the Europa Conference League on Thursday, and they only had a stoppage-time goal from Kelechi Iheanacho to show for their efforts. 66 mins: Kulusevski is running riot. Outrageous skill to beat Thomas, with the Leicester man failing in his attempt to then hack Kulusevski down. Hojbjerg’s touch isn’t good enough and the chance goes. Referee goes back to book Thomas - that was a really ugly swipe. 64 mins: Amartey catches Kane really high and that will be a yellow card for the Leicester man. Spurs on course for this to be a great afternoon - won’t want that to be ruined by an injury to Kane. Conte’s substitution immediately made a different, with Kulusevski slipping in Son, but the goal was made by a crunching double challenge by Romero. The Argentine has been imperious again today. SPURS DOUBLE THE LEAD! All started with two monstrous tackles from Romero. Came to Kulusevski, he cuts inside and slides it through to Son. Nice turn, great finish and that’s the second. 59 mins: Almost an instant impact from Kulusevski. Beats a couple of challenges, into the box, past Soyuncu... and trips over. Not what was required. 58 mins: Bentancur the latest player into the book - that’s been coming. Mendy turned him really nicely and the Spurs man just swept his legs away. Easy decision. 55 mins: First Tottenham change of the match. Kulusevski on to replace Moura. If you’re being generous you’d describe the Brazilian’s display as ‘quiet’. 53 mins: Moura looks to get on the end of a ball through the Leicester defence, goes down under a challenge from Soyuncu. Was he tripped? The Spurs fans think so. The referee doesn’t. On we go. 50 mins: Romero plays the ball into the edge of the box, where Hojbjerg is briefly playing as the central striker. Spurs will wish it wasn’t him - he pokes a strange pass straight out of play. Moura a bit confused with that. ",positive,spurs,5

Spurs face a daunting trip to quadruple-chasing Liverpool on Saturday evening before Arsenal host Leeds, who have been dragged into the thick of a three-way relegation fight. With a two-point lead over their bitter rivals, fourth-placed Arsenal will be the more comfortable of the two, and this weekend offers them a good chance to open up a five-point gap on Spurs and potentially a cushion going into the north London derby at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Thursday week. But this is merely a scrap for fourth place, quite different to the relentless nature of the title race between Liverpool and Manchester City. Neither Arsenal nor Spurs have shown enough consistency this season to suggest they are certain to win their three other fixtures, so there should be more twists to come. If Spurs have an X-factor, it is their world-class individuals. In head coach Antonio Conte, they have one of the game’s best, while Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester was made comfortable by the brilliance of Harry Kane, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski at one end and Cristian Romero at the other. Arsenal, by contrast, are lacking the same star quality but feel like a more rounded team under Mikel Arteta, further along in their rebuild than their neighbours. Last month, Brighton and Brentford offered a blueprint of how to nullify Conte’s Spurs — specifically, deny them space in the final third and stop Kane getting on the ball — and, in having a more clearly-defined system, Arsenal are harder to stop and better at breaking down stubborn opponents. Arteta is also getting more from his squad than Conte, and important performances from fringe players Mohamed Elneny, Eddie Nketiah and Rob Holding in the wins over Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham point to a united group, with deceptive depth. By contrast, Lucas Moura was hopelessly rusty on his first Spurs start since mid-February on Sunday, while Harry Winks was off the pace in a late cameo, hardly surprisingly given Conte has barely changed his XI for over two months. Both clubs have been impacted by injuries in the same positions, with Spurs losing midfielder Oliver Skipp and wing-back Matt Doherty, and Arsenal without Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney in similar positions. Mikel Arteta vs Antonio Conte - who will win the race for Champions League qualification? The absences may prove crucial in the run-in. In Nuno Tavares, who is deputising for Tierney at left wing-back, Arsenal have an agent of chaos, and while the Portuguese is in the team there is a chance they will drop points in any game. Kulusevski, who came off the bench to twice assist Son on Sunday, should have the beating of Tavares if they both start on May 12. For all their star quality up front, Spurs, though, are weak on both flanks. In the absence of Doherty and Sergio Reguilon, who is sidelined indefinitely with a groin injury, wing-backs Emerson Royal and Ryan Sessegnon failed to make an impact in the final third against Leicester. But it is long past the point where Conte is likely to change his system or experiment on the flanks. If Arsenal allow Spurs’ wing-backs to have the ball, and keep it away from their forwards, they will be in a strong position next week. Spurs finish the season against Burnley, who are likely to be fighting for survival, and already-relegated Norwich, while Arsenal face a tough trip to Newcastle and host Everton on the final day, when the Toffees may also be playing for their Premier League status. The derby will surely be crucial, but the fight for Champions League football could come down to Spurs’ individual brilliance against Arsenal’s collective cohesion and unity. Whatever happens in the next fortnight, expect the contest to go the wire. ",positive,spurs,11
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-tottenham-north-london-derby-rob-holding-b997628.html,Rob Holding urges Arsenal not be distracted by crucial Tottenham derby with Leeds clash up first,"ob Holding has warned his Arsenal team-mates not to get distracted by next week’s Champions League decider against Tottenham ahead of their meeting with Leeds. Arsenal are currently sat fourth in the Premier League table, two points ahead of Spurs in fifth with four games left to play this season. The rivals are set to go head to head a week on Thursday (May 12) in a match that is being billed as one of the biggest north London derbies in recent history. Holding admits the Arsenal squad are well aware that game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium will have a huge say on who qualifies for the Champions League, but the centre-back has also urged his team-mates not to allow it to distract them as Leeds visit the Emirates on Sunday. “We have got to take it a game at a time,” Holding told Standard Sport, when asked about the north London derby. “Obviously we have got Leeds at the weekend and that’s always an intense game. “They come and bring energy. It will be a tough game, but we are at home with the fans behind us and we can try to chalk up another three points. Rob Holding has warned Arsenal not to look past Leeds with a crucial north London derby looming “Then the following week on the Thursday we have Tottenham, so that’s what it’ll come down to and it should be a good game.” Arsenal and Tottenham have been neck and neck in the top-four race, and they momentarily swapped places on Sunday after Spurs beat Leicester in the early kick-off. The Gunners responded by defeating West Ham and have now won three games on the spin after initially losing the same number of matches at the start of April. Those wins have come against Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham, with Holding partly putting the turnaround down to Arsenal supporters sticking by the team during a difficult spell. “I think since Mikel [Arteta] has come in there has been a big change in mentality and connecting with the fans,” he said. “I think on Sunday the fans were amazing again and they have been for the last couple of weeks, in terms of away games and at home. “That’s why our results have been decent since those three that we lost. We bounced back and they stuck by us. It could have been an easy point to turn on us, but they stuck by us and we’ve had three good results now.” ",negative,spurs,2

Son reached 19 goals for the season with a clinical double in Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester, making him the outright top scorer from open play in the Premier League and behind only Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah -- on 22 -- in the race for the Golden Boot. Both of Son’s goals came with his supposedly weaker left foot, including a stunning effort into the top corner to make it 3-0, and he also assisted Harry Kane’s opener with a corner. Kane is widely regarded as one of the best forwards in the world but Son is often overlooked in debates about the league’s best marksmen, despite his consistency. Asked about the front five of next weekend’s opponents Liverpool, Sessegnon said he would not swap Kane or Son for anyone and believes the latter is underrated on account of his character. Asked if Son is one of the best in the world, Sessegnon said: ""100 per cent. He has been consistent over the last six or seven years, doing it at the top level and the numbers speak for themselves. ""It’s hard to know why he is underrated because consistently, season after season, his numbers are there. I think it’s because he’s such a down-to-earth, normal guy. He’s not an arrogant person and he’s just very friendly with everyone. That’s probably why [he is underrated]. ""Of course, [Son and Kane] make it much easier for us. They can do special things on the ball and you saw that again on Sunday. Sonny assisted H again and their combination they’ve had ever since playing together is unbelievable. ""No way [would we swap them]. The two players we have [up front] are world class and we wouldn’t swap them for anyone."" Sessegnon’s Spurs career has been revived under Antonio Conte and he is hoping the head coach remains at the club next season, despite his consistent refusals to commit beyond the end of the current campaign. The wing-back insists the speculation over Conte’s future is not a distraction for the squad and says the Italian is helping to restore his confidence after a succession of hamstring injuries. ""Is the speculation unsettling? Not really, not at all,"" Sessegnon said. ""We’re professionals and we focus on our game and step by step. You heard him yourself, [the speculation is] obviously false news, he’s focusing on here at the club. As players we’re just focusing on our job going forward and that’s all we can do. ""Of course I hope he stays, he’s a top manager and he’s shown that with us this season. We hope he’s here next season and for us the main objective is to get in that top four and then prepare for next season. ""It has not been easy [for me] since I’ve been at the club, but step by step he gives me confidence in every game to go and do what I can do,"" Sessegnon added. ""For me it’s about believing in myself and getting in that positive run, feeling good and keep pushing. ""Every day, every game as well learning bit by bit, the defensive side, the attacking side. Of course he’s very demanding and [as a wing-back] you need to be up and down. You almost have to manage yourself when to go, when to relax a little bit, but it is relentless."" Asked if he now has confidence in his body to remain injury-free, the 21-year-old added: ""Definitely. At times it is quite hard, it’s a mental battle with the physical side as well. Right now I feel good and I’m giving 100 per cent every time I’m out there."" Arsenal’s win at West Ham later on Sunday means Spurs remain two points behind their fourth-placed rivals and need to beat quadruple-chasing Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday to guarantee they will be within touching distance of their neighbours in next week’s potentially crucial north London derby. Sessegnon impressed in the 2-2 draw with Jurgen Klopp’s side in December and says both the team and himself can take confidence from that performance. ""We’ll look at the game and see the positives and take those positives into the next game at Anfield,"" he said. ""We know it’s a different stage of the season and we have to manage it. But again when we have the chances to score, we should take those chances. ""I think every game I play in this team gives me confidence to go and do what I want to do on the pitch, especially against the big teams as I played well in the last game when they came here. It’ll be no different going into that game."" ",positive,spurs,2

Harry Kane’s goal and a Heung-min Son double ensured Spurs moved above their north London neighbours, at least temporarily, with the Gunners due to play West Ham later in the day. A much-changed Leicester, who are prioritising Thursday’s Conference League semi-final decider against Roma, struck the post early on through Patson Daka but were undone when Kane header home Son’s corner in the first half. After the break, South Korean finished inside the box from substitute Dejan Kulusevski’s pass before curling home a stunning effort from 20 yards to seal an important victory. Kelechi Iheanacho bagged a late consolation for Leicester when his long-range effort range crept inside the near post. Dan Kilpatrick was at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to rate the Spurs players... Hugo Lloris 7 Made a fine fingertip save to turn Daka’s early effort on to the post and quick off his line when needed. Couldn’t keep out Iheanacho’s late strike, which was right in the corner. Cristian Romero 9 A presence at both ends of the pitch in another imposing display. Made the second goal with a magnificent double tackle, the second absolutely cleaning out Caglar Soyuncu. Eric Dier 8 Won some important headers in a calm performance. Coped well with sub Jamie Vardy for the final 25 minutes. Ben Davies 7 Gifted Leicester an early chance in a sloppy moment but solid thereafter. Stepped out of defence well on a couple of occasions. Emerson Royal 5 Tidy and worked hard but failed to make any impact in the final third. He was involved in the build up to Son’s second goal, however. Rodrigo Bentancur 7 Passing was hit and miss, but got struck in and helped Spurs to establish midfield dominance after the interval. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg 7 Used the ball well and was one of Spurs’ better players in the first half, despite a mix-up with Romero leading to Daka’s chance. Might have been clear on goal from Kulusevski’s pass but touch was poor. Ryan Sessegnon 6 Got in some good positions but struggled to make inroads against his opposite man in another difficult outing. Still looked short of confidence. Lucas Moura 4 Back in the XI for the first time since the defeat to Wolves in mid-February, he did nothing to suggest he has deserved more playing time. Never got going and was more liability than threat. Heung-min Son 9 Made the game safe with two second half goals, including a stunning curling finish. Assisted Kane with a near-post corner in a match-winning display. Harry Kane 7 Continued his remarkable record against Leicester with an 18th goal in 17 appearances, a firm header from Son’s corner. Subs Dejan Kulusevski (Lucas 55’) 8 Responded to being rested with an immediate impact from the bench, slipping in Son to double the scoring and setting up his second goal with a simple pass. Harry Winks (Bentancur 81’) 4 Beaten too easily by Iheanacho in the build up to Leicester’s goal. Steven Bergwijn (Son 81’) 6 No repeat of his late heroics at the King Power in a brief cameo.

The Dutchman, who was the subject of interest from Ajax over the course of the January transfer window, has not started a Premier League game since mid-January following the arrival of Dejan Kulusevski. With Lucas Moura also seemingly ahead of him in the pecking order and Spurs’ attack proving prolific under Antonio Conte, the forward’s chances of breaking into the starting XI look remote at best. Only one of his four starts this season has come under Conte, with the former PSV star failing to capitalise on the famous brace he scored at Leicester during a dramatic win back in January. Spurs snubbed a £15m offer from Ajax and Conte has previously hinted he would like to keep Bergwijn, although the player himself appeared to cast doubt on his Tottenham future when speaking to Dutch outlet Algemeen Dagblad. “A place in the starting line up? Here? I honestly don’t think so,” he said. “The attack works well, but I don’t get to play much. “A return to the Netherlands would certainly be an option for me. The World Cup is coming. Mr. Van Gaal, the national coach, brought me into the selection last time, even though I didn’t play much.” “Then you come back to the club and you barely play. It is a shame, of course. In the summer we really have to look for a solution”. ",positive,spurs,2

Tottenham’s win over Leicester earlier in the day had piled the pressure on Arteta’s side, who kicked-off in fifth place and without key defender Ben White, who missed out with a tight hamstring. In as his replacement, Holding scored the first Premier League goal of his career when he glanced in an opener just after the half-hour mark before Jarrod Bowen’s equaliser. Gabriel would then score a second header as Arsenal saw the game out, moving back above Spurs in a tight Champions League battle. It was another impressive performance from Holding in particular, his second in quick-succession after playing a crucial role in the 4-2 win at Chelsea last month, a result that got Arsenal moving back up the table following a run of three consecutive losses. After the game, Arteta told Sky Sports: “We showed incredible spirit because when we could play the way we wanted to play we had to find a way to play the way they prefer. We adapted. You have to find a way to win all the time to win - forcing mistakes, being brilliant, digging in, clean sheets. “I am really happy, especially for Rob Holding as he hasn’t played the amount of minutes he deserves.

After a dull opening half an hour, Rob Holding – who once again impressed - scored the first Premier League goal of his career with a glancing header following Bukayo Saka’s corner. From there, the game burst into life. Seconds after Holding’s opener, Aaron Ramsdale pulled off a brilliant reactionary save as Declan Rice’s near-post flick-on flew towards him at break-neck speed. As is becoming customary for this West Ham side, David Moyes’ team were able to feed off a loud home crowd and create their own momentum, with Vladimir Coufal teeing up Jarrod Bowen for an improvised finish to level the scores just before the interval. After the break, the home side started brightly once more. Bowen proved the livewire in the absence of a central striker, although was booked for diving when Ramsdale raced out of his box to sweep up a long ball in-behind the Arsenal defence. With the game finely-poised, a set-piece was likely to be the difference and so it proved when Gabriel Martinelli crossed for compatriot Gabriel Magalhaes to power in what proved to be the winner ten minutes into the second-half. With a corner cleared, Martinelli reacted first and hung up an inviting cross for his teammate to convert with a crushing header at the back post. Eddie Nketiah twice went close to adding a third but this was a game in which Arteta’s side overcame a major hurdle.

Spurs moved back ahead of Arsenal, albeit possibly temporarily, after Son scored twice in the second half, including a stunning effort into the top corner, against a much-changed Leicester. The South Korean’s first-half corner was headed home by Harry Kane — his 18th goal in 17 appearances against his former loan club — and he twice finished passes from substitute Dejan Kulusevski after the break. Kelechi Iheanacho scored a stoppage-time consolation for the Foxes, who made eight changes ahead of their visit to Roma for Thursday’s Europa Conference League semi-final decider. “I gave him a big hug because after an amazing goal my question was, ‘Which is his favourite foot, right or left?’” Conte said of Son, who scored both goals his his supposedly weaker left foot. “He scored a fantastic goal and three minutes before, when I spoke with him, I said, ‘Go for five or six minutes and then I have to make a change’. “So [after the game] I said to him, ‘You listened that I wanted to make a change and you decide to score this amazing goal!’ “We are talking about a great player, a fantastic player. “But it’s important at the end of the season to celebrate a big achievement with the team. Otherwise it remains only a personal success to score these types of goals.” Spurs moved a point clear of Arsenal, with Conte’s side facing Liverpool at Anfield next weekend and Arsenal playing Leeds, before they meet in a potentially decisive north London derby on May 12. Conte added: “It was a good performance against a really good team. “The game wasn’t easy and we knew very well that despite them making eight changes from the last game against Roma you can see the quality, you can see the squad that Leicester has. “For sure we got three points in an important moment of the season especially because in the next games we are going to face first Liverpool and then Arsenal. “Today it was vital to get three points. There is only one result and a lot of pressure, but I said to my players to live this moment, to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months. “I think no one at the start of the season could imagine Tottenham challenging for a place in the Champions League, especially in November when there was a change [of manager] and for this reason we have to be satisfied that we stay in this position to fight for a big achievement.” Conte also hailed Cristian Romero, who was imperious on the right of Spurs’ back three and helped create their all-important second goal - a close range finish from Son. The Argentine won the ball in a crunching 50-50 with Caglar Soyuncu before Kulusevski slipped in Son. “He played a good game,” the Spurs head coach said. “I think every single player played very well. For us it’s very important to do well with the whole team if we want to get three points. It’s no good to play with one, two or three players playing good. We need the whole team playing well and to find a good balance. When this happens we can win the game.” ",positive,spurs,4

For the majority of a scrappy game, there was little between Spurs and a much-changed Foxes, who are prioritising Thursday’s Europa Conference League decider against Roma, but the hosts’ individual quality told after the break, with Son scoring twice and Romero imperious at centre-half. The South Korean’s second goal was stunning curling effort from the edge of the box to make it 3-0, leaving Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg with his head in his hands, while Harry Kane showed flashes of brilliance and opened the scoring in the first half with his 19th goal in 18 appearances against Leicester. Kelechi Iheanacho scored a stoppage-time consolation for the visitors, who struck the post through Patson Daka at 0-0 but were undone by Son after Brendan Rodgers made eight chances ahead of the trip to Rome. This was not the most polished or convincing display from Antonio Conte’s side but, at this stage of this season, points are the only thing that matter and the win move Spurs one ahead of Arsenal, who face West Ham in the later kick-off. Kane predictability opened the scoring, making it 17 goals in 14 League games against his former loan club, while Son continued to prove that he does not need to be especially involved in games to be the most important player on the pitch. Romero, meanwhile, was outstanding, a class above in everything he did. The Argentine’s ferocious tackling set the tone for Spurs to kick-on in the second half and actually proved an attacking weapon in itself when he won the ball in the crunching challenge on Caglar Soyuncu in the build-up to Son’s all-important second goal. Dejan Kulusevski was also decisive, responding to being rested by coming off the bench and making both of Son’s goals, the first with a clever pass. But Son was really the star, moving ahead of Mohamed Salah for non-penalty goals this season, suggesting he still remains something of an underrated force. Rather than dominating matches, he is increasingly a clutch player in the final third, assisting or scoring when they need a jolt. He set Spurs on their way with a corner for Kane to stoop and score at the near post. If his first goal was a poacher’s finish inside the box, the second goal was inspired, as Son curled into the top corner with his left foot from 20 yards, leaving Kaspar Schmeichel with no chance. This win was an important reminder that while Spurs remain a work in progress under Conte, they have the individuals at both ends of the pitch to win any of their final four matches, even next weekend’s visit to Liverpool, when Kane and Son should relish the space behind the hosts’ high line. A frustration for Conte is that none of his stars had stepped up in the meek displays against Brighton and Brentford, although a Leicester side who are hard-wired to play on the front-foot were also likely to be a more attractive opponent for Conte’s side. While Arsenal are arguably a more well-rounded side than Spurs, further ahead in their development under Mikel Arteta, if this game is anything to go by, Spurs’ individual brilliance and world-class front two could be an important factor in the race for the Champions League.

Son’s second, and Spurs’ third, came in stunning fashion, as the South Korean curled home a finish into the top corner from 20 yards to cap off a perfect afternoon for the hosts. Kelechi Iheanacho got the visitors on the scoresheet in the dying moments, but any hopes of a comeback had long since gone. It lifts Tottenham back into fourth place in the Premier League, though that will change if Arsenal come away from the London Stadium with three points later on Sunday. Spurs started the better of the two sides but it was a much-changed Leicester side who very nearly took the lead early on as Patson Daka was denied by the woodwork. Cristian Romero then had to make a brilliant interception to stop the Foxes striker having a tap-in at the back post. Despite that strong spell, it was Tottenham who found the opening goal of the match. The Foxes once again were found wanting defending a set-piece, as Son swung in the corner and Kane was there to head home. Spurs’ main man went close to getting his second of the afternoon as he pounced on a loose pass and poked an effort at goal, Kasper Schmeichel doing just about enough to keep it out. After a scrappy start to the second-half, Tottenham took real control of proceedings on the hour mark. Two huge challenges from Cristian Romero set them away, and Dejan Kulusevski then slid the ball through to Son. He turned smartly in the box and fired home with his left foot to double the advantage. Leicester never looked like mounting a comeback but any hopes of one were ended when Son got his second. He picked up the ball, cut inside onto his left and bent a stunning effort into the top corner to put the result beyond any doubt. Iheanacho added a late consolation in stoppage-time, but it did little to dampen the mood on a positive afternoon for Spurs in north London. ",positive,spurs,5
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-conte-levy-psg-b997258.html,Tottenham: Crunch talks with Daniel Levy still key to Antonio Conte’s future despite dismissing PSG rumours,"ntonio Conte has again refused to offer guarantees he will be at Tottenham next season, saying his future will only be decided after a meeting with the club at the end of the campaign. On Friday, Conte dismissed reports he had offered himself to Paris Saint-Germain as “fake news” and “lies”, and it was suggested to him at a later briefing that he could put an end to unwanted speculation over his future by committing to Spurs. But Conte reiterated that he was only focussed on the final five games of the season and would sit down with the club -- meaning chairman Daniel Levy and managing director Fabio Paratici -- to find “the best solution” after the visit to Norwich on May 22. The head coach effectively wants guarantees that Spurs can challenge at the top of the Premier League, saying he deserves “much more” than another scrap for fourth place next season, and suggested his future would depend on whether he has the patience to match the time needed to rebuild the squad. “As I said to [the media] a lot of times, at the end of the season we'll speak with the club but with pleasure, in a really good way,"" Conte said. “We'll speak and try to find the best solution for everybody. This has to be clear. “I repeat: don’t forget I like to have ambition, not only to fight for a place in Champions League or a place in the [Europa] League. Honestly, I want to fight for much more. For much more. I think also I deserve to do this. “It will be very important to understand how much time we need to fight for something important [and] if we have the patience to wait because for sure this is a process. “I always say to you that we need time and patience. And we have to understand how much time we need and how much patience we have. We have to understand this and to understand if we can match my opinion and the club's opinion. “I know very well that in England it is not simple [to win]. First of all, to fight for and to try to win the title is not simple. It’s important to understand also how much time we need if our ambition is to fight to win the title.” Spurs are two points behind fourth-place Arsenal ahead of Sunday's visit of Leicester but host the Gunners on May 12 in what could effectively be a play-off for Champions League football. Daniel Levy “If we are very good to [achieve] this target, it will be a great achievement for the club, for me. It would be important,” Conte added. “With our ambitions for the future, it would be very important, because I think that I deserve to try to fight for and to win trophies and to fight for something important, not for only sixth or seventh, eight place, or if you have a fantastic season, fourth place. Only this. “But I repeat this is my ambition and it is important to understand and fully match the ambition at the time that we need it.” Conte is under contract until the end of next season and the deal is understood to not include a break clause. Pushed on why he could not commit to Spurs, he added: “My answer is always the same and my answer is still the same, to have another answer is not useful for anyone. My opinion didn’t change, my thoughts didn’t change, my ambition didn’t change. I am the same. I have a fantastic relationship with all the people who work here, and with Daniel Levy and Fabio Paratici. “What I said in the past was the truth. We are trying do this season in the best possible way and then we will see.” Conte's comments will put more pressure on Levy to promise the back the Italian but the head coach insisted he is enjoying his role and working under the chairman and Paratici. “I repeat I am enjoying a lot to work here, I have a fantastic relationship with all the people who work here and with Daniel Levy our chairman and Fabio Paratici,” Conte said. “For this reason it is right to at the end to have a good meeting, a private meeting, and to try to find the best solution for everybody. “When you start to stay for a good period in a club and you understand the dynamics, you start to know much better the people that work with you, the environment “And for sure I always said that I am enjoying a lot to work in Tottenham, to stay in Tottenham, and to come to the training ground, to breath this atmosphere. I can speak only well about Tottenham, about the club. For a coach, a manager, it is a good opportunity and you can enjoy your work here.” ",positive,spurs,4

Head of recruitment Carey, who worked remotely and whose role was understood to be less grandiose than his title suggested, had been with Spurs for six years and follows technical performance director Steve Hitchen, who resigned in February, out of the club. “We can confirm that Head of Recruitment Brian Carey has decided to leave his role following six years at the Club. We would like to thank Brian for his work and wish him well for the future,” Tottenham said in a brief statement on Wednesday. Managing director Fabio Paratici is undertaking a thorough revamp of Tottenham’s scouting and recruitment teams and is close to appointing a new No2 to support him in running the football side of the club following Hitchen's exit. Paratici, who had only worked in Italy before joining Spurs, including alongside Antonio Conte at Juventus, wants more specialist knowledge of the English market, although his proposed new deputy is understood to be from overseas. Paratici and Conte have made two new additions at Tottenham so far, recruiting Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur from Turin in January. Paratici’s first summer window in charge saw the arrivals of the likes of Bryan Gil, Emerson Royal, Cristian Romero, Pierluigi Gollini and Pape Sarr. ",positive,spurs,2
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-steven-bergwijn-ajax-transfer-news-b976056.html,Steven Bergwijn: Tottenham demanding higher transfer fee for Dutch winger after Ajax fail with opening bid,"jax are expected to return with an improved bid for Tottenham's Steven Bergwijn after seeing an opening offer of €18million (around £15m) rejected by the Premier League club. Spurs will consider offers for Bergwijn this month but want to recoup closer to the £27m they paid PSV Eindhoven for the winger two years ago. Bergwijn, 24, was the first permanent signing of Jose Mourinho's tenure in January 2020 but could be the first departure under Antonio Conte, if Ajax return with a sufficiently improved offer. Bergwijn, who was born in Amsterdam, came through the ranks at Ajax before joining their rivals PSV in 2011, and is thought to be open to a return to the Eredivisie champions after two frustrating years in the Premier League. Spurs, however, would be reluctant to allow Bergwijn to leave until they have signed a replacement, particularly with Heung-min Son currently sidelined with a hamstring injury until at least the end of the month. Bergwijn made an impressive start at Spurs, scoring in his first three home league games including stunners against both Manchester clubs, but he has since struggled for confidence and fitness. He scored just once last season and opened his account for this term in December's 2-1 win over West Ham in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals, also assisting Lucas Moura's winner. Tottenham will allow Dutch winger Steven Bergwijn to leave the club this month His display earned praise from Conte, who has raised the possibility of Bergwijn deputising for Harry Kane up front when the England captain needs a rest. Bergwijn has not played since Boxing Day due to a calf injury but Conte said before Sunday's 3-1 win over Morecambe he expected to welcome back the Dutch international ""very soon"". Quizzed on Bergwijn’s future at a press conference held before the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg against Chelsea, Conte said: “Honestly, Bergwijn he knows very well what I think about him. I consider him a player that can play in all three roles. As a No9 and as a No10. “For sure, in my period at Tottenham, he was injured for a long time but I showed him that when he’s in a good physical condition, I gave him a chance to show he’s a good player. For sure, Bergwijn is a Tottenham player and he’s very close to coming back. “After the game against Chelsea, he can start having training sessions with us. I count on him. He’s a player with different characteristics to Sonny, Lucas and Harry. He’s very good 1v1, he’s a creative player that we don’t have in our squad.” ",positive,spurs,3

Ajax had a £15million bid for the Netherlands international winger rejected earlier this month but had not given up hope of persuading Spurs to sell. Tottenham were ready to consider offers for Bergwijn at the start of January and allow him to leave if Ajax returned with a sufficiently improved offer. But Antonio Conte has consistently said he wants to keep Bergwijn, even before his memorable heroics in the last-gasp win at Leicester. Bergwijn scored two injury-time goals as Tottenham fought back from 2-1 down to snatch an incredible 3-2 victory at the King Power Stadium, and Spurs hope that dramatic night will help revitalise his career in north London after two frustrating years in the Premier League. Conte has said he believes the 24-year-old can deputise for Harry Kane up front when the England captain needs a rest. And a move for Bergwijn, who was the first permanent signing of Jose Mourinho’s tenure in January 2020, back to the Eredivisie before the transfer deadline has been ruled out. ",positive,spurs,2

Emma Hayes’ side were not at their best against Spurs but Beth England and Kerr’s goals, either side of Kerys Harrop equalising for Spurs, secured them a vital 2-1 win. It means Chelsea are now four points clear of Arsenal at the top of the WSL with two matches to go, although the Gunners have a game in hand. “They (Tottenham) have taken big points off big clubs this year, so we knew it wasn’t going to be easy,” said Kerr. “They’re a good team so it does feel like a good three points, but any win is an important win now. There are two games to go and we’re just going to grind through. If we get all six points we’re champions.” Chelsea’s win last night has put pressure on Arsenal, who are trying to catch the Blues in the final stretch. They have a game in hand on Hayes’ side, which is next Wednesday when they host Tottenham at Emirates Stadium, but before that they will take on Aston Villa on Sunday. Chelsea, meanwhile, are travelling to bottom of the table Birmingham. “We’re in the title race and fighting to be champions. Last season the team was fighting to get third place,” said Arsenal boss Jonas Eidevall. “It’s much more fun to be fighting for the title and if anyone had told us that before the season we would’ve taken it, so let’s enjoy it.” Arsenal will play before Chelsea on Sunday, kicking off at 2pm and four hours earlier than the Blues in the evening. “We just have to control what we can do and get the three points each game and we’re praying Chelsea slip up,” Beth Mead added.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-antonio-conte-top-four-b997102.html,Antonio Conte must use squad to freshen up stale Tottenham after pair of blanks,"ntonio Conte’s view of his Tottenham squad can be summed up by a phrase the head coach has used to explain his reluctance to make substitutions. “I look to the bench, then I look back to the pitch!” Conte has remarked to staff. Conte, in short, is not convinced by his options outside his first XI, and the only changes he has made in 12 matches have been forced by injuries at wing-back. Saturday’s frustrating 0-0 draw with Brentford perfectly demonstrated Conte’s unwillingness to turn to his bench. With Spurs needing a goal to match Arsenal’s earlier win over Manchester United, Conte’s first change was centre-half Davinson Sanchez for Ryan Sessegnon in the 74th minute, while he did not introduce Lucas Moura until four minutes from time. Steven Bergwijn remained unused, which was bizarre in the circumstances, particularly given the Dutchman’s heroics in the last meeting with Sunday’s opponents Leicester, who visit north London on the back of last night’s 1-1 home draw against Roma in the Europa Conference League. Substitute Bergwijn scored twice in stoppage-time as Spurs sensationally won 3-2, despite trailing in the 95th minute, at the King Power Stadium in January. There is a view from some at Spurs that Bergwijn being the match-winner that night may not have been entirely in the club’s best interests. His stunning late show effectively ensured it would be a PR disaster to sell him to Ajax in the final week of January, as Spurs were considering, but he has since played just 175 minutes in the League. Clearly, the club might have been better off selling him and doing a late deal for a wing-back or an attacker Conte really rates. The big issue with Conte’s reluctance to use his full squad is that his first XI quickly ran out of ideas and steam in the matches against Brighton and Brentford and, damningly, Spurs go into Sunday having not had a shot on target for over three hours. Graham Potter’s Seagulls may just have established a blueprint with which to stop Conte’s side — specifically, prevent Harry Kane from getting on the ball and deny the England captain, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski space in the final third. For all their encouraging progress under Conte, Spurs are still not much better at creating chances against canny opponents as they were under Jose Mourinho. Their wins over Leeds, Everton and West Ham came against sides who all adopted a gung-ho approach, while the thrashings of Aston Villa and Newcastle came after they had been outplayed in the first half but managed to establish a lead, before picking off an opponent who had to chase the game. Until he can make those signings, establishing a Plan B would be a start, but Conte is committed to his approach and appears reluctant to experiment. Among his options would be a switch to a back-four, with Bergwijn or Moura coming in at the expense of a defender, but this risks Spurs’ defensive solidity, which has remained intact. A more realistic move would be to bring either of the above into the front three and move Kulusevski to right wing-back, where the injured Matt Doherty is a miss, as Conte did for the final few minutes against Brentford. The risk there is that the connection between the midfield two and front three is further disrupted without link-man Kulusevski drifting between the thirds. Adding an extra midfield body in Harry Winks is another possibility. The good news for Conte is that Spurs’ next three opponents — Leicester, Liverpool and Arsenal — all have coaches who prefer their teams to have possession and play on the front foot, which should suit the Italian’s approach of absorbing pressure and attacking the space. Conte, though, cannot continue to rely on opponents playing into his team’s hands if Spurs are to overhaul Arsenal again in the battle for fourth. ",positive,spurs,9
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-lo-celso-villarreal-conte-b996508.html,Giovani Lo Celso transformed at Villarreal as Antonio Conte proved right after Tottenham struggle,"f all the supposed Premier League rejects, misfits and cast-offs who make up Unai Emery's Villarreal squad against Liverpool tonight, none feel as important to their hopes of another Champions League upset as Tottenham loanee Giovani Lo Celso. Lo Celso has added guile and grit to Emery's midfield and was outstanding as Villarreal eliminated first Juventus then Bayern Munich in the knockouts. Lo Celso was man of the match in the 1-0 win over Bayern in the quarter-final first leg, and pivotal again in the subsequent 1-1 draw in Germany, playing both games with a fizzing intensity which the Bundesliga giants found difficult to contain. He got the pre-assist for both the Yellow Submarine's goals across the tie. The performances could scarcely have been more contrasting to Lo Celso's limp efforts in his final months at Spurs, when the simplest of tasks looked beyond him and supporters grew increasingly exasperated with his inability to impact matches. The Argentine's turnaround since returning to Spain on January deadline day has not come entirely out of the blue, however, but rather feels like the result of a talented player being back in an environment which suits him. Giovani Lo Celso has revitalised his career since leaving Tottenham for Villarreal on a loan deal in January This is certainly the view of Spurs boss Antonio Conte, who regards the midfielder as gifted but ill-suited to the intensity and physicality of English football and judged that he needed to be playing regularly back on the continent. Conte has a point. Lo Celso enjoys dribbling and likes to release the ball late, when he has drawn in an opponent and space has opened up ahead, making him susceptible to challenges. His pass in the build-up to Samuel Chukwueze's decisive goal at Bayern was a good example. In LaLiga and the Champions League, Lo Celso is afforded more time and is said to feel more protected, and therefore more comfortable, than in English football. Before joining Spurs he had practically never been injured but two-and-a-half years of hard knocks in England led to a succession of niggles and more serious complaints, which sapped his confidence and disrupted his rhythm. His commitment to playing for his country, even while Argentina was on the UK's ""red list"" of travel destinations, further contributed to his stop-start season at Spurs and frustrated the club, particularly given the view that Lo Celso was the ringleader in September, when he, Cristian Romero and Davinson Sanchez reported for international duty against the club's wishes and subsequently spent 10 days training in Croatia to avoid a spell in quarantine. That said, Conte's predecessors Jose Mourinho and Mauricio Pochettino admired Lo Celso, and he looked more than capable of playing in England during Project Restart, when he was the heartbeat of Mourinho's improving Tottenham side. While many at Spurs found Lo Celso stand-offish, Mourinho liked his quiet determination and said in July 2020 he would not swap him for ""any player"". Last season, injuries and a loss of form largely reduced Lo Celso to the role of alternate for Tanguy Ndombele, who could rarely maintain his intensity for longer than an hour, and Mourinho's seeming lack of trust in him continued under Conte. Lo Celso spent last season at Spurs as an alternate for the disappointing Tanguy Ndombele By contrast, Emery, who managed Lo Celso at Paris Saint-Germain, has placed enormous faith in the 26-year-old, and regards him as a tactically intelligent player who can carry out specific jobs. Lo Celso has quickly become the leader of Villarreal's defensive press, and he is expected to play off the right in tonight's semi-final first leg to deal with the threat of left-back Andy Robertson, just as he did so successfully against Bayern. While Lo Celso's lack of a defined position was a problem at Spurs, Emery enjoys his versatility and will move him around during matches to suit the situation. There is also a view that Lo Celso may prefer being a bigger fish in a smaller pond, having struggled at PSG and Spurs but shone for Real Betis and Villarreal, who are seventh in LaLiga and will need to win the Champions League to return to the competition next season. Villarreal are desperate to keep Lo Celso but his loan deal does not include an obligation to buy at the end of the season, and Spurs want to recoup as much of the £55million fee they paid Betis as possible. Villarreal have never spent more than £21m on a player and are likely to push for another loan deal. Given Lo Celso’s impact for Villarreal, Spurs could find he has no shortage of suitors in the summer One intriguing hypothetical would be the return of Pochettino from PSG to north London in a job swap with Conte, which has been mooted this week. Lo Celso was signed on Pochettino's watch and he may be more open to keeping his compatriot than Conte. Given Lo Celso's impact for Villarreal, Spurs could find he has no shortage of suitors in the summer, however, particularly if he impresses again at Anfield tonight. ",positive,spurs,11

Having watched top four rivals Arsenal beat Manchester United earlier on Saturday, Spurs knew the pressure was on. They looked devoid of all attacking creativity and for the second successive game they failed to have a shot on target. It could have been even worse as Ivan Toney was denied by the woodwork twice as Brentford almost made it four wins in a row. Tottenham’s front three of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski were again blunted and it looks as if Spurs, who had scored a glut of goals in recent weeks, have been found out. Their top-four hopes remain in their own hands, however, as they still have Arsenal to play at home in a game that is looking like being decisive in the race.

It had been suggested that the Italian was interested in taking over from Mauricio Pochettino at the French champions this summer, raising the possibility of a job swap that would have seen the Argentine return to north London. Conte’s contract runs until the end of next season but he has repeatedly said he will discuss his future with the club at the end of the campaign, with Spurs currently locked in a battle with rivals Arsenal for fourth place. When asked about the PSG links on Friday, Conte said: “Obviously I think that it's good that other clubs appreciate my work. This is one thing. But the truth is that I don't like when people try to invest news, only to speak, only to create probnlems. “This is not right, not fair for me, for the clubs involved and for my players. “Also because we're really focussed on these five games to get a fantastic result for us. I repeat, this type of situation makes me smile. “But I think that also the people that want to tell something about this have to show respect for all the people involved in this situation, and not invent fake news and tell a lot of lies.” Asked if he had spoken to his players about the reports, Conte added: “In this situation, who works in football - players or managers - know very well that at this point of the season, a lot of fake news starts to go out. “We're working very hard and my players know very well we're very focused. We're speaking a lot about this opportunity. “We have to live this situation with passion, enthusiasm and joy. I repeat, we deserve to stay there and to fight for a place in the Champions League. A place in Champions League is not easy for no one. “To stay there, we need to enjoy this situation. For this reason, I repeat our fans have to stay with us at every moment. Positive and negative moments. “We deserve to fight until the end and have a big push from our fans.” Conte’s Spurs have slipped two points behind Arsenal with five games to play after losing to Brighton and last weekend’s frustrating draw with Brentford. Ahead of Leicester’s visit on Sunday, he issued a rallying cry to his players and supporters to keep pushing in the final five games. “I want to underline that we’re fighting for a target that, at the start of the season, no one could imagine,” Conte said. “Especially in November because when I arrived the situation wasn’t good - otherwise you wouldn’t change the coach. So to arrive with five games to go with the possibility to get this result is a great achievement for us. “So for this reason, we have to face the situation with great enthusiasm because we have nothing to lose and only to earn. “We are doing something special for the situation we faced this season. I spoke with my players and it’s the same with our fans, they have to continue to support us and push us until the end. “We’re living this dream. We have to continue until the end to get a place in the Champions League. It’s right to underline that we are fighting for a target that wasn’t in our mind at the start of the season. “For this reason I want to push everybody at the club to have great enthusiasm, great passion, our fans to stay with us and to back us from the start until the end. “If we reach this target, all the people in Tottenham have to be happy to reach this target and everybody has to be involved to meet this target.” ",positive,spurs,2
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-spurs-levy-summer-conte-transfers-b996593.html,Tottenham: Daniel Levy facing huge summer dilemma as Antonio Conte plots transfer overhaul,"aniel Levy is experienced enough to brush off speculation and is used to ignoring noise from his managers, but employing Antonio Conte must occasionally test the Tottenham chairman’s patience. This week, in the wake of Spurs’ frustrating stalemate with Brentford which dented their chances of returning to the Champions League, a fresh round of reports linked Conte with a summer exit, with the head coach rumoured to be interested in succeeding Mauricio Pochettino at Paris Saint-Germain. They raised the intriguing prospect of a sensational job swap between Conte and Pochettino, but Levy will surely be growing exasperated with Conte’s quit threats and rumours of his interest in other jobs — even if the Italian’s camp insist the PSG stories did not come from them. While Pochettino’s likely dismissal by PSG offers Levy an attractive safety net in the event that Conte walks at the end of the season, the danger for the chairman is a repeat of last summer, which he spent searching for a new manager and battling with Harry Kane over his future. These concerns are part of the package in employing Conte, who is notoriously high maintenance and described by one senior figure at Chelsea as making Jose Mourinho “look like a pussycat”. The hard-to-please coach will always demand more and his rhetoric should be viewed, at least in part, as a means of pressuring the club to give him what he wants. Clearly, there is an argument that Levy and managing director Fabio Paratici should do whatever possible to appease Conte in the transfer market this summer. Given Tottenham’s position in the food chain, the chairman may never again have one of the world’s top coaches, at the very peak of his powers, in his employ, and for all the (justified) talk of Pochettino being a better profile of manager for the club, backing Conte still feels like Spurs’ best chance of real success next season. For Levy, it is not quite so simple, though. Conte’s short-term contract, which runs until the end of next season, and his apparent concerns that Spurs do not have the means to compete for the League title, mean Levy and Paratici will have to be particularly careful to sign players who suit both Conte and the club this summer. As Saturday’s draw demonstrated, Conte is rigidly committed to his preferred system and, if he stays in north London, he wants at least six new players — among them two wing-backs and a left-sided centre-half who can play in a back three. He also favours experienced, senior players. Should Daniel Levy back Antonio Conte in the transfer market, knowing he could walk away from Tottenham? Conte tends to leave clubs in a better condition than he finds them but Levy will still be wary of backing the head coach to the tune of millions of pounds on specialist players when there remains a danger he could walk away as soon as he gets a more attractive offer, or at the end of his contract. Levy has already showed an admirable willingness to back Conte, offloading the club’s record signings, Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso, for nothing in January, and signing Dejan Kulusevski — a former Conte target at Inter Milan — and Rodrigo Bentancur from Juventus. Completely reshaping the squad in Conte’s image, however, poses long-term risks while his position and future remain uncertain, so Levy and Paratici must tread carefully. Liverpool’s rebuild under Jurgen Klopp, by contrast, was made easier by his long-term commitment to the club, ensuring they could sign players to suit the German’s approach. Manchester City have done the same with Pep Guardiola but Spurs are disadvantaged both by being more financially prudent than their rivals in the market, and having a rigid tactician whose future is not certain. Spurs have already spent £50million on a centre-half who excels in a back three and spending the same again on a left-footed version of Cristian Romero may not suit, say, Pochettino, who prefers playing a four-man defence (and might have also been happy to work with Lo Celso and Ndombele, as another example). It might be in Conte’s interests to start showing some commitment to Spurs, starting with a new deal The success of Kulusevski and Bentancur offer reasons for optimism, proving that Paratici can find targets to suit the club’s policy of young, versatile players while still satisfying Conte, but this summer will certainly test the relationship between the two Italians, and Levy’s willingness to cede control over big deals to the pair. Paradoxically, in pushing Spurs to back him with a drip-drip of hints and threats, Conte has arguably made it harder for the club to give him everything he wants. It might be in Conte’s interests to start showing some commitment to Spurs, starting with a new deal, if he is to convince the club to go full-throttle behind his vision. ",positive,spurs,8

Speaking last week, prior to undergoing surgery, Skipp opened up on his frustrations at seeing what had been a breakthrough campaign derailed by injury. “Come the international break, I had an injection which other players have had in the past and the hope was that the original pain would go but that’s not been the case,” he said. “There’s been various times where I felt like I was I getting there but with the nature of this injury it hasn’t materialised that I’ve come back yet. “It’s been a really frustrating one for me, the most difficult part of it is being in the unknown.” ",negative,spurs,1

Son suffered a muscle injury in his leg during Wednesday's 2-0 defeat to Chelsea in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at Stamford Bridge. Spurs have five matches before the end of January, with League One Morecambe the visitors in the FA Cup third round on Sunday before the second leg against Chelsea on Wednesday night. They also play European rivals Arsenal, Leicester and Chelsea in the league before the end of the month. “The day after [the Chelsea game], he felt a bit of pain in his muscle, in his leg,” Conte said of Son. “He had a scan and now we have to make the right evaluation from the doctors. He has an injury. I don’t know, but probably he will stay without training sessions until the end of this cycle, for the international break.” In a separate interview with Spurs TV, Conte clarified that Son was expected to be sidelined for around two weeks. The Italian plans to rest Harry Kane against the Shrimps this weekend and rotate his side, but it is unclear who will deputise up front, with Steven Bergwijn, who Conte has previously touted for the role of Kane’s understudy, also injured. “Honestly, Harry played six games in 17 days,” Conte said. “And I think if I have the possibility, I think it’s right to give him a bit of a rest. “Also because after this game, before the international break, we have four games, very difficult games. Chelsea, Arsenal, Leicester and then Chelsea again. It’s always difficult to think, to decide not to start with Harry. But at the same time, in some games if we can take the risk it’s right to take. Heung-min Son was injured during Tottenham’s Carabao Cup defeat by Chelsea “I spoke with Steven today and his feeling is good. He’s improving day by day, step by step.

To expect anything in the way of wholesale changes during the arduous January market would be too much, although Conte is a man who does need satisfying. Having constantly spoken about needing to raise the level of the team, surely Spurs will be doing all they can to back him during what remains of this month. At least showing Conte there’s a chance to grow and a readiness to provide him with fresh options is of the utmost importance. If the the Italian does not feel there’s a willingness to rebuild the squad, perhaps the former Chelsea boss’ frustration will grow. With that in mind, here’s a look at the latest on Spurs’ transfer gossip. SPONSORED According to Fabrizio Romano, Spurs and Newcastle United have had loan offers for the forward snubbed. While Martial is believed to be looking for a way out of Old Trafford, it seems his future could lie abroad. Sevilla, Barcelona and Juventus are all said to be keen in what must be a blow for Spurs given Conte has called for a new addition in that department. Dan Kilpatrick has previously reported that Fabio Paratici is actively looking to sell the midfielder. Conte has been rather cutting in his assessment of the Frenchman and, after being booed off against Morecambe in the FA Cup, it’s very hard to see a way back for him. Still, finding a buyer this month is likely to be difficult. Perhaps the major name to have been linked with Spurs this month, Wolves have snubbed a £15m offer for the player and are holding out for £20m, It remains to be seen if Spurs will go that far. Given Pierluigi Gollini has barely covered himself in glory and Hugo Lloris is yet to extend his contract, a new goalkeeper could be needed at Spurs. Earlier this month, the MEN reported that Spurs were keen on a move for Manchester United’s Dean Henderson, although Ralf Rangnick has since stressed he’s looking to keep the England hopeful despite his lack of first-team minutes.

We started with identifying potential sites, finding out who owned them, then looking to get permission for the project. For a variety of reasons, this is not as simple as it sounds. Especially when introducing a relatively new concept to an area. The hope is that once this first mural is in place, other people will come forward with suitable sites. “We had a meeting with Ledley and Tony Stevens from the club at the end of November 2021, where we put the idea to Ledley and showed him the concepts. It’s fair to say that he was delighted and humbled by the idea. “I also think that it’s quite an abstract concept when you are first approached for something like this, but then it all becomes a bit more focused when you see the scale of the project. It’s also really nice for Ledley to think that this fans tribute will be in place for a long time. “The club has been extremely supportive of the project, and they have really got behind the Ledley mural. I know that this project has inspired them, and that they’re looking to use this experience to build on some more heritage and Spurs history ideas in the local area. “This is a response to the calls to pay tribute to club legends. It’s also a really good way of engaging with the local community. “The long-term vision is to have about 10 to 12 pieces of Spurs history artwork throughout Haringey, which help to tell the story of the club. “The pieces do not all need to be the size of the Ledley mural but could form part of a history/heritage trail and some could also tell the stories of the lesser-known characters. This could be funded by various fan groups, overseas or in the UK, who would then decide on who or what they wanted to see.” ",positive,spurs,4
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-morecambe-harry-winks-b975830.html,Tottenham players held ‘harsh and honest’ inquest in dressing room after ‘sloppy’ first half against Morecambe,"arry Winks has revealed that Tottenham’s players conducted a ""harsh and honest"" inquest in the dressing room at half-time before their late FA Cup salvage job against Morecambe. Spurs survived a major scare as they rallied and scored three goals in the final 16 minutes to come from behind and see off the League One strugglers 3-1 on Sunday. Tottenham laboured, particularly in the first half, until Antonio Conte called for the cavalry and introduced Harry Kane, Lucas Moura and Oliver Skipp in the 69th minute. Winks equalised with a free-kick five minutes later before Lucas put Spurs ahead and Kane then sealed victory. Winks said it was disappointing that Tottenham’s second-string needed to be bailed out by their star forwards again after a display that he said “wasn’t good enough”. ""There is disappointment, it wasn’t good enough,” said Winks. “It was sloppy. We weren't sharp or aggressive enough. We didn't play with enough pressure or intensity. We could have upped our game a lot. “At half-time, there was a lot of harsh and honest words said. It wasn’t good enough and we know that. We hold ourselves accountable. We did better in the second half than the first, but it's not good enough. “These are the kinds of games where in the first 10 or 15 minutes, you need to settle everybody, settle the crowd and then enjoy the game. We made an enjoyable afternoon into a tough one. We shouldn't have done that. “We got the result, we got the win, it's nothing to be too happy about because we made it difficult for ourselves and we shouldn't really celebrate. We should be looking back and seeing what we can do better.” ",positive,spurs,2
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-steven-bergwijn-harry-kane-antonio-conte-b969598.html,Tottenham boss Antonio Conte puts faith in Steven Bergwijn as Harry Kane understudy during packed fixture list,"ntonio Conte has offered Steven Bergwijn the chance to revive his Tottenham career by becoming Harry Kane’s understudy at centre-forward. Spurs begin a gruelling run of ten games in 30 days with Thursday night’s home derby against Brentford and Conte has confirmed that Kane, the club’s only senior striker, is unlikely to start them all. Bergwijn has struggled for consistency since joining Spurs from PSV Eindhoven in January 2020 and the winger has been linked with a return to the Eredivisie next month. Under Conte's predecessors, Heung-min Son typically deputised for Kane through the middle, but the Italian wants to keep Son at No10 and revealed he is prepping Bergwijn to play up front. Asked by Standard Sport if Kane would need to be rested this month, Conte said: “I think so and I also think Steven could be a good option [to deputise]. ""In the past I have seen that Son played No9. Honestly, I prefer Son to play as a No10 – in the position that he is now playing. I like to have a point of reference as No9. Steven is working and we are utilising him also in this position [and] in the three positions off the striker. Steven could be a good option on the day that I want to give a rest to Harry.” Bergwijn scored on his first three home appearances in England, including crackers against both Manchester clubs, but his confidence appeared to drain after he missed a glorious chance in the 2-1 defeat at Liverpool in December – which triggered Spurs' slide down the table. He has scored just once for Spurs since the start of last season but Conte says the Netherlands international – who helped his country qualify for the World Cup with a brilliant goal last month – is not alone in lacking confidence. “I honestly think many players have to recover their confidence at Tottenham,” the head coach said. “When you finish the season in seventh, for sure the confidence is not up. This is another aspect we’re working on – to improve [players’] confidence."" Conte added: “[In Steven] we're talking about a player that has important skills. It was a pity for me – but not the [Dutch] national team, because he scored in qualifying – because I would have liked to have him during the two weeks of the international break to work with him and know him much better. “But for sure he has great quality. He's good one-v-one, he's fast, he can beat a man and also score. He's understanding what I want from him. Tonight, he’s ready and available – and I’m counting on him.” Kane has started all four matches under Conte, including the embarrassing defeat to NS Mura last week, and he was named in the XI for Sunday’s postponed visit to Burnley. Getting the best out of the England captain remains one of Conte’s most pressing challenges, with Kane still having scored just once in 11 League appearances. Conte, though, has no doubts about Kane’s enduring quality and says he has only been able to truly appreciate his “level” since working with him at close quarters. “We have a world-class striker as a No9 in Harry and I am very delighted to have the opportunity to work with him because many times you make an evaluation [of a player from] outside [the club],” Conte said. “But only when the coach has the possibility to train players, do you understand their level. With Harry, I was enthusiastic to see him in the way that he works every day and the commitment, heart and passion that he puts into Tottenham. It was not a surprise but when you arrive you do not know what you find. And I found this.” Conte will be without Argentine pair Cristian Romero and Giovani Lo Celso against the Bees, and could name the same XI which was due to start at Burnley before snow forced an 11th-hour delay.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-steven-bergwijn-goal-antonio-conte-b977709.html,Steven Bergwijn’s Lucas Moura ‘Ajax moment’ could be a springboard for the Antonio Conte era at Tottenham,"eep into stoppage time at the King Power, Tottenham were on course for another one of those nights, the kind that has come to typify their season. They had struck the woodwork, had two efforts heroically cleared off the line, missed several more clear-cut chances, yet at the end of it all, were on course to be undone by two Leicester goals that owed much to defensive passivity and misfortune. Sergio Reguilon’s tackle had fallen kindly for Patson Daka to open the scoring, then Japhet Tanganga’s attempted block took James Maddison’s effort past Hugo Lloris after Harry Kane had equalised. An unbeaten start to life under Antonio Conte in the Premier League - the saving grace and great cause for optimism amid a meagre Carabao Cup semi-final defeat and a controversial European exit - was about to go up in smoke. And then came Steven Bergwijn, with a late cameo that evoked memories of Lucas Moura against Ajax, scoring goals in the 95th and 97th minutes to give Spurs a victory that will be celebrated perhaps as much as any in the turbulent years since. The Dutchman, on as a substitute after Maddison’s strike had put the Foxes back ahead, smashed home from close range after Matt Doherty’s effort was blocked, then paid homage to Lucas in the Johan Cruyff Arena with a reverse-finish that slid agonisingly past a stranded keeper so unfathomably late in the day you feared the referee’s whistle might blow before it had time to cross the line. The famous 3-2 in Amsterdam provided the greatest night of Mauricio Pochettino’s era and, at last, Antonio Conte will feel that, in a victory on the road by the same scoreline, his own has its springboard. For were it not for the late drama, this would have been a defeat difficult for the Italian to take not because of his team’s inadequacies, but because of how much they had impressed. Despite starting with a midfield trio that, on paper, possessed about as much flair as a box of Bran Flakes, Spurs produced their most incisive attacking display for some time and could conceivably have scored five by half-time. Much of that owed to an improved performance from Kane and the return of Sergio Reguilon. Having Reguilon back from injury mercifully allowed Conte to call time on his experiment with Doherty as a left-wing-back and his presence made all the difference to Spurs as an attacking force. The Spaniard linked nicely with Kane and Lucas and brought a directness in the final-third that has been lacking during Doherty’s brief stint as deputy, the Irishman forever slowing attacks out of the necessity of checking back onto his right-foot. Earmarked as one of the players who could most benefit from Conte’s arrival, Reguilon’s stock has risen further as understudies have faltered during his absence and if Spurs can bring similar thrust to the opposite flank it will ease the burden on a midfield not blessed with creativity. To his credit, Doherty was much-improved returning to his preferred position on the right as a half-time replacement for the ineffectual Emerson Royal, but a good 45 minutes will have done little convince Conte he is the solution, against a hefty backcatalogue of work that suggests he is not. As for Kane, the Carabao Cup matches against Chelsea had represented a backwards step, after he had looked close to rediscovering his best form when scoring in three successive Premier League games in December. The England captain was a lumbering, peripheral figure stranded on halfway for much of that two-legged tie as Thomas Tuchel’s side held Spurs at arm’s length for the best part of 180 minutes. Given his goalscoring record against Arsenal, he must have been as frustrated as anyone to see Sunday’s derby fall by the wayside, but Leicester have proved even more fruitful opposition over the years and the 28-year-old put those Chelsea regressions behind him with a threatening, domineering display, the spearhead of a Spurs attack that looked as potent as it has all season, particularly before the break. His composed equaliser on 39 minutes came after he had already headed against the bar and been denied by Luke Thomas on the line, and took his tally against the Foxes to 18 in 17 career league appearances. As the clock ticked beyond 90 minutes, though, it still looked like it would be his failure to make it 19 when slid clean-through by Lucas at 1-1 that would prove decisive. That was until deep into stoppage time, when he in turn sent Bergwijn clear to ensure it, in fact, did not matter one jot. ",positive,spurs,6

Deadline Day is over with Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United making no significant additions to their squads. Tottenham had a busy day, with Juventus duo Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur becoming the first signings of the Antonio Conte era, while Tanguy Ndombele completed his return to Lyon on loan, Giovani Lo Celso went to Villarreal and Dele Alli joined Everton in a dramatic late deal. Arsenal have not added to their ranks, beyond Auston Trusty who will stay at Colorado Rapids, despite reports linking them to moves for Alvaro Morata and Alexander Isak, but did see a further departure. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang joined Barcelona on a free transfer, with an announcement expected on Tuesday morning. Ousmane Dembele was linked with both Chelsea and Manchester United in recent days, with reports suggesting a move to PSG has broken down, but will stay at Barcelona. Meanwhile, Kylian Mbappe is said to have decided to join Real Madrid. SPONSORED Liverpool have already secured Luis Diaz, and tried to make late swoop for Fulham’s Fabio Carvalho, but could not complete the move in time. There were no incomings as expected at Crystal Palace, though they have made Jean-Philippe Mateta’s move a permanent one. Donny van de Beek has joined Everton, while West Ham‘s hopes of re-signing Jesse Lingard are over, with Man United not willing to let him leave this month. Newcastle have signed Brighton defender Dan Burn before the deadline but their move for Hugo Ekitike has collapsed. In the other major done deals of the day, Manchester City have landed Julian Alvarez, Rangers have signed Aaron Ramsey on loan and Christian Eriksen has joined Brentford for six months. Follow transfer deadline day LIVE with Standard Sport’s blog below! It’s been a long month and there’s been plenty to keep track of in the Premier League. Dele Alli to Everton, Christian Eriksen to Brentford and Philippe Coutinho were some of the most notable moves made. Here’s a full list of every incoming deal made by top-flight clubs in the January window. Just 16 months after signing a lucrative three-year contract and vowing to become an Arsenal legend, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left under a cloud, writes Simon Collings. Aubameyang was exiled by Mikel Arteta after being stripped of the captaincy following a disciplinary breach that ultimately led to a sad end to his time at Emirates Stadium. He has not played a minute since December, was dropped from the squad and Arteta said he failed to demonstrate the “commitment and passion” to play for the club. Clearly, their relationship was broken beyond repair. Read the full story here on the long-term thinking behind Arsenal’s bold decision. It’s the one we’ve been waiting for! Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s free transfer to Barcelona has officially been confirmed by Arsenal. Aubameyang was pictured arriving in Barcelona on Monday lunchtime, when the clubs were in talks over a potential loan move, but as reports emerged that the deal had broken down it was suggested he had only been in the Spanish city to visit family. However, the deal was revived late in the day as a permanent transfer, signalling the end of the forward’s Arsenal career. Read the full story here. Arsenal’s January transfer window was a tale of frustration and, ultimately, the failure to strengthen the squad will ramp up the pressure to spend in the summer, writes Standard Sport’s Simon Collings. Mikel Arteta was bullish throughout last month about the need for Arsenal to “maximise every window” and, while that may have been the case with outgoings, it wasn’t so with incomings. Read the full story. Chelsea have confirmed the signing of Mason Burstow from Charlton, with the teenager heading back to the Valley on loan. Read the full story. Dele Alli paid special tribute to Mauricio Pochettino as he bid farewell to Tottenham after seven years at the club. Everton signed the midfielder on an initial free transfer, which could reach £30million, on transfer deadline day. It ended Dele’s long association with Spurs, and he thanked the club and fans for their support. Notably, former boss Pochettino and his staff were thanked for their “trust and guidance” during the early part of his career in North London. He wrote on social media: “It’s the end of the chapter but not the book. Thank you all for the messages.” Read the full story. Newcastle confirm the loan exit of Jack Young to Wycombe on loan. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was pictured in Barcelona kit for the first time on Tuesday - as he underwent a training session before his move from Arsenal was officially announced. The final details and paperwork were completed overnight for the Gabonese striker’s free transfer to the Camp Nou. Read the full story. Thomas Tuchel was left frustrated by the failure to cover Chelsea’s injury crisis during the January window, writes Standard Sport’s James Robson. But the German – who warned the season could be wrecked if no mid-season additions were made – will be boosted by the return of Reece James, Andreas Christensen and Trevoh Chalobah this month. Tuchel’s main priority was always to bring in longer-term targets if they became available in January. And the focus will be on stamping more of his mark on the squad in the summer, with a host names already identified. Read the full story. Barcelona president Joan Laporta has claimed that Ousmane Dembele has already found his next club after rejecting a move to the Premier League on deadline day. Chelsea were strongly linked with the French winger, who was available for a move after negotiations over a new Barcelona contract collapsed. Instead, he will now leave as a free agent in the summer. “The Dembele thing is difficult to understand,” Laporta told a press conference on Tuesday. “Dembele is in the team and Xavi has to build a competitive squad with players who have a future at this club. “We think that Dembele already has a contract with another club, they have insinuated that to us. What we will do is defend the interests of our club.” Read the full story. ",positive,spurs,1

Valencia confirmed the deal with only a few hours remaining before the deadline, and deployed a Harry Potter-style teaser clip to introduce their floppy-haired new star. Surprisingly popping up was Potter actor Oliver Phelps, who played George Weasley in the film series. “I’ve seen some amazing magic come out of London,” he said in Los Che’s Twitter announcement clip. “But this time, it’s a magician on the wing! “Destination: The most magical temple on earth, the Mestalla. Amunt [Go on] Bryan, Amunt Valencia!” Spurs are undergoing a frantic squad reset on transfer deadline day having initially failed to land top targets Adama Traore and Luis Diaz. On Monday, Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur arrived from Juventus, leading to the club allowing Spaniard Gil to return to his homeland. The winger underwent his medical for a loan move until the summer at Monday lunchtime. Reports in Spain indicate that Valencia will not pay a fee for his temporary switch, while it is also understood that no fee has been agreed for a permanent switch. The 20-year-old failed to score a goal and provided only one assist in his 20 appearances for Tottenham, since signing from Sevilla in a deal involving around £20million and Erik Lamela last summer. Also on deadline day, Tanguy Ndombele completed his departure from North London with a loan move back to Lyon.

The deal would see Dele initially head to Goodison Park on a free transfer, with a £10m fee due to Tottenham after he makes 20 appearances. The fee could eventually rise to £30m depending on performance. The Toffees confirmed Frank Lampard as their new manager on Monday afternoon and within hours of his appointment the former Chelsea boss was hopeful of making Dele his first official signing. Everton have already wrapped up the loan signing of Donny van de Beek from Manchester United, with Lampard's approval. Spurs were expecting to loan out Dele this month but Everton used their final loan spot on Van de Beek and can only pursue a permanent deal. Dele joined Spurs from MK Dons in summer 2015 and established himself as one of the most exciting young players in Europe but he gradually fallen from favour in the last few years, and struggled under all three managers since Mauricio Pochettino was sacked. Newcastle were expected to come in for Dele this month but that never materialised. He has made just seven Premier League appearances for Tottenham this season and Antonio Conte made it clear he was available for transfer in January. In total, Dele has played 269 games for Spurs and scored 67 goals. ",positive,spurs,3

Juventus have confirmed Tottenham have paid a £8.4m loan fee. Spurs will also have an obligation to buy Kulusevski if he hits certain goals over the next 18 months. Bentancur has 46 caps for Uruguay and will join up with the Spurs squad after their World Cup qualifier against Venezuela in Montevideo on Tuesday. Kulusevski has 20 caps for Sweden.

Tanguy Ndombele has completed a loan move to Lyon, while Dele Alli is discussing a permanent move to Everton and Villarreal are in talks with Giovani Lo Celso. Major targets had routinely rejected a move to North London before the Juve duo arrived; Adama Traore, Dusan Vlahovic, and Luis Diaz opting for moves elsewhere despite Tottenham interest. But Conte will hope that Kulusevski and Bentancur can inject fresh life into his squad, which are only fighting on two fronts after being kicked out of Europe and losing to Chelsea in the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup. The Italian manager competed against the pair as Inter Milan coach in recent seasons, and both are familiar to managing director Fabio Paratici, who brought them to Juventus during his 11 years in Turin.

Premier League result, match stream and latest updates today","ottenham vs Leicester LIVE! Heung-min Son’s stunning goal helped Tottenham get their Champions League hopes back on track with a 3-1 win over Leicester. The South Korean curled a 20-yard effort into the top corner to seal a brace that sees him register his highest tally in a Premier League season, moving to 19 goals - just three behind Mohamed Salah in the race for the Golden Boot. Harry Kane got the ball rolling with his customary goal against the Foxes, heading in a first-half corner for his 19th goal in 18 games against his former loan club. The victory ends a two-game blip and piles the pressure on Arsenal ahead of their game at West Ham as the race for the top four looks increasingly likely to go down to the rearranged north London derby in the penultimate week of the season. It was clear where Leicester’s attention lies, as they made eight changes to the side which drew 1-1 with Roma in the Europa Conference League on Thursday, and they only had a stoppage-time goal from Kelechi Iheanacho to show for their efforts. 36 mins: Albrighton swings a free-kick into the Spurs box, Romero up to head it away. He’s been brilliant again so far, the centre-back. Been in the right position a couple of times right when his side really needed him. 33 mins: NEARLY TWO FOR KANE! Leicester nearly gift Spurs a second. The striker pounces on a loose ball, pokes it at goal and Schmeichel charging off his line does just about enough to deny Kane. 30 mins: Leicester seeing plenty of the ball, mainly at the back though. Spurs with no real interest in pressing high. They’ll just be looking to pick their moments on the counter now, which they do so well. 28 mins: Davies into the book for a late challenge on Daka, Problems again for Leicester though, Soyuncu heads over his own bar and it’s another corner for Spurs. Taken short, eventually comes in and headed away at the near post. Real waste. 26 mins: It’s a mess from Leicester but it does the job. Amartey misses it, Perez hacks at it and scoops it up behind. Fortunately, straight to Schmeichel. Foxes would be wise to try and avoid conceding corners, judging by their efforts defending them so far. Tottenham’s first shot on target in 221 minutes yields a goal and the scorer is no surprise. It’s Kane 19th goal against the Foxes in just 18 appearances. Rodgers will be furious his side made it so easy for Spurs, who are now well-placed to pick off a side who must chase the game. 24 mins: Moura looks to burst through the middle, Amartey across and concedes a corner. Can Leicester defend this one a bit better? Well they’re going to try and be tighter. Referee halts play to have a word about some jostling. TOTTENHAM TAKE THE LEAD! As simple as you like. Son with the corner, Kane with the header and Spurs are in front! They needed that, Leicester were putting them under real pressure. 19 mins: Royal gets up well to head the free-kick away. Albrighton puts it back in, rolls all the way through to Soyuncu at the back post. Eventually it’s worked in again, Dier there to clear. Leicester completely on top. 18 mins: Bentancur far too keen to win the ball back and he bundles into Perez. That will be a Leicester free-kick. Replays showing Leicester could well have had a penalty a couple of minutes ago. Looks like Son handled in the box. ",positive,spurs,6
https://talksport.com/football/1100217/arsenal-transfer-news-lautaro-martinez/,Arsenal to renew interest in Inter Milan star Lautaro Martinez with transfer hinging on Champions League with Man United also keen,"Arsenal have renewed their interest in signing Inter striker Lautaro Martinez. According to The Times, the Gunners are hoping their improved chances of playing in next season’s Champions League could help them in luring the 24-year-old to the Premier League. Martinez has been hugely impressive for the Italian giants this term having scored 21 goals for Simone Inzaghi’s side, which has kept a number of European rivals on alert. This includes Manchester United who could reportedly offer Anthony Martial in exchange. And while Martinez is among the top targets for Mikel Arteta’s side, he’s not the only player whom the Spaniard is after. Gabriel Jesus of Manchester City and Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin are also said to be on the club’s radar as they prepare to revamp their forward line this summer. Arsenal’s hopes of signing Martinez could hinge on their ability to finish the season in the top four. The Gunners are sitting in fourth in the Premier League at present, two points clear of rivals Tottenham, however, with a north London derby just around the corner, talkSPORT host and former Tottenham midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes it’s Spurs who will pip Arsenal to the final Champions League spot.  He told thetalkSPORT Breakfast: “We’ve got to get through Liverpool which is a tough fixture and I’ll be surprised if we get anything from that, but both Arsenal and Tottenham are where they are because they have inconsistent performances. “If we’re talking about winning all of our games between now and the end of the season, we’d be like Chelsea and Liverpool. “We’ll slip up and Arsenal will slip up. We’ve got the north London derby which will be the biggest north London derby in recent times and that is a huge, huge fixture. “I just fancy us, under the lights with the players that we’ve got and the front three that we’ve got. If we step up I think we can turn them over, I really do. “This is a young Arsenal side and credit to them, no one expected them to be where they are and it was a big performance against West Ham and they’re a good young team. “But I think that Spurs have just got a little bit more experience than them and when the pressure’s on, we might just find a way to get it done.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

We are now into May, which means the business end of the year is fast approaching and the race for the Champions League spots is at fever pitch. With Manchester City and Liverpool well clear at the top, there are five more teams in contention for the final two Champions League places plus the Europa League spots, with some massive ties ahead. Most of the sides involved only have four games left, but Manchester United only have two. Here talkSPORT takes a look at the Premier League top-four battle as we approach the end of the campaign…   Chelsea have been in the top four the whole season, and are five points clear of fifth. However, their place in the top four isn’t secure yet and they are going to need a few more results from their last four league games. Thomas Tuchel’s side started the campaign as genuine title contenders, but four wins in 11 saw them drop well behind City and Liverpool. From there, it looked as if the Blues would comfortably seal third, but after defeats to Brentford, Arsenal and Everton, that doesn’t look to be guaranteed yet. Chelsea have had to deal with carnage away from the pitch this season, which would likely mean the Blues will have to cap their spending this summer. So, if they were to miss out on the Champions League, who knows what could happen to the club without that income? In their remaining games, Chelsea face Wolves and Leeds. If they manage to avoid defeat in these fixtures, they should do enough to secure their place in the top four. But a season that had so much promise looks like it will end in slight disappointment. Predicted finish – 3rd Wolves – H – May 8 Leeds – A – May 11 Leicester – H – May 19 Watford – H – May 22  Arsenal have turned it around after a nightmare start that saw them at the bottom of the table after three defeats. Since then, the Gunners have pushed on and they are right in the race for the top four. The North Londoners haven’t played in the Champions League since the 2016/17 campaign, and Mikel Arteta has put his faith in a lot of young and very talented footballers. This group of players have been brilliant for the Gunners, but they lost three games in a row recently against Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton. However, just when things could have turned sour, they managed to beat Chelsea, Man United and West Ham to move two points clear of Spurs. The Gunners still have some massive games to play against the likes of Tottenham and Everton, so Arsenal could yet miss out on a place in the top four. Predicted finish – 5th Leeds United – H – May 8 Tottenham – A – May 12 Newcastle – A – May 15 Everton – H – May 22  Tottenham have had a very odd season but they are still in the race for the Champions League. Spurs started the campaign with Nuno Espirito Santo in charge, but after winning his first three league games, things quickly went wrong and he was dismissed well before Christmas. Antonio Conte arrived as his replacement, and after a solid start in which Tottenham were unbeaten in the league for nine matches, they lost four of their next five, including a 1-0 defeat to Burnley. Things didn’t look great, but on transfer deadline day, Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur arrived from Juventus and have helped turn the season around. Spurs then scored 25 goals in seven league matches, winning six of those. However, they then lost to Brighton and only managed a 0-0 draw against Brentford, which halted their season. But they got back to winning ways on Sunday with a 3-1 victory over Leicester City, so they are back on track. If we look at their remaining fixtures, we can see they still have to play Liverpool and Arsenal. The North London derby against the Gunners could decide who lands that final Champions League spot, but Spurs should still have enough to finish fourth if they turn it on again. Predicted finish – 4th Liverpool – A – May 7 Arsenal – H – May 12 Burnley – H – May 15 Norwich – A – May 22  Man United have had a season to forget – they are out of all the cup competitions and look unlikely to get a place in the top four. The season started with so much optimism after the signings of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho. However, things quickly went wrong, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was dismissed early into the campaign. The Red Devils then brought Ralf Rangnick in until the end of the year as interim manager, but he has never performed that role before and has struggled to get a tune out of this squad. The German has only lost five of his 22 league games in charge but seven draws in that time have cost the Red Devils valuable points, and it looks increasingly likely they won’t finish in the top four. Man United still have to play Crystal Palace and a resurgent Brighton in their last two, but Arsenal and Tottenham have two games in hand on the Red Devils. Therefore, this campaign has the potential to end terribly for the world’s most famous club. Predicted finish – 7th Brighton – A – May 7 Crystal Palace – A – May 22  West Ham have not been outside of the top ten this season and have been as high as third on some occasions. It’s been highly impressive given that David Moyes has a small squad to work with and has one first-team striker in Michail Antonio. The Hammers are also deep into the Europa League, so the fact they have kept up with the likes of Arsenal and Tottenham is commendable, and they should finish in a Europa League spot no matter what. This season has seen the Irons beat the likes of Liverpool and Chelsea but the top four might just be out of their reach. However, given they are in the semi-finals of the Europa League, you would have to make them one of the favourites for that competition, so they could end up in the Champions League anyway. West Ham still have to play Manchester City, so they could still have a big impact on the title race.
