The result relegated the Canaries and the striker's former head coach Dean Smith, but the 51-year-old will be proud of Watkins as he continues to make an impact at the highest level. Smith recruited Watkins for Brentford and later Villa, as he broke the club's transfer record to bring the versatile forward to Villa Park for £30million two summers ago.

After scoring against San Marino on his Three Lions debut, he was handed four more caps, but wasn't picked for England November internationals. Speaking in December, Steven Gerrard claimed that the Villa forward could force his way back into Gareth Southgate's plans before the 2022 World Cup. ""It’s been a pleasure to work with him and I’m looking forward to the future. I’m delighted to have him here,"" Gerrard said. ""Ollie has just got to be the best he can be for Aston Villa and I’m sure that will be enough for him to get back in the England squad and I’m sure Gareth Southgate will be watching him closely.

Villa head coach Gerrard was also certain that Watkins would thrive in his system. He said: ""I don’t think there is a limit for Ollie. ""He’s got the lot – pace, power, aggression. He will grow, he will enjoy the style we play so there isn’t a ceiling for him.""

The 20-year-old is the latest youngster to break into Villa's first-team ranks and cement his place in the starting XI. Ramsey has enjoyed an exceptional Premier League campaign following on from his breakthrough season last term. He has made 31 league appearances for Villa this season and has started all but one of Steven Gerrard's first 22 games in charge of the club.

As a product of the Villa academy, the midfielder has been with the club since the age of six and progressed through the ranks. And when asked how much of a lift it gives him when supporters are chanting his name, Ramsey replied: ""Obviously being a local lad, I’ve been going to Villa Park since I was the age of eight now. ""I know what it’s like to sing those songs, when I was singing about Jack (Grealish), so now for the fans to sing it about me, it gives me a real buzz to go out and play. I think especially in front of my friends and family to hear the fans singing my name, it’s a good feeling."" Speaking of Ramsey, Villa boss Gerrard told BirminghamLive: ""I've been very aware of the Ramseys because of how well this club did in the Youth Cup. They obviously played Liverpool in the final and I was aware of the commentators speaking of the Ramsey brothers, also the Carneys (Chukwuemeka) and Tims (Iroegbunam), those around the game. ""It probably wasn't until Arsenal away where he curled one into the top corner. I really liked the technique of that goal. I think that was the moment where I thought, 'Ooh!' ""To score a goal like that, in an environment like that at Arsenal at that age, that is normally a moment, being a lover of the game, where it makes you think, 'Hang on a minute, this kid might be a player!' ""Then, obviously Dean (Smith) played him some more before I arrived but it's not until you get up close and personal with someone on the training pitch and you see his level and potential, you see the human being... That's when you get really excited about the talent. ""I've said it quite a bit. I don't want to keep talking JJ up. I want him to play his football and to protect him and manage him in the best possible way but, without a doubt, he's someone I want to build around this club moving forward.""

Azaz, 21, has spent the season on loan with Newport in his second loan spell away from Villa Park and has impressed for the Exiles, winning the League Two Young Player of the Year award last week. The midfielder has been a constant figure for Newport this season, missing just four games since his arrival and scoring seven goals for James Rowberry's side.

Azaz completed 83% of his passes and had a 100% shot accuracy. It wasn't just providing goals where the midfielder impressed, he completed three of his four dribbles and made 13 recoveries in defence.

Aston Villa fans have been left raving over the young midfielder's performance and have issued the following reaction to his performance: @SlowJamesForever: Not the first time the comparisons have been there to be made this season but there's definite shades of a certain former Liverpool midfielder and current Villa manager in this, and his game in general.

The former Liverpool striker joined the Baggies on a free transfer in January after his short-term deal with Reading expired. He has since gone on to score three goals in 15 Championship appearances. Although Carroll has not been hugely prolific in front of goal, he has impressed with his general play in leading the line and has been arguably the team's top performer since arriving as injury cover for Daryl Dike.

The manager says that the decision will create space on the wage bill as they look to strengthen other areas of the team. “We’ve got two centre forwards, one (Kenneth Zohore) we’ve paid £8million for and the other (Daryl Dike) £7million in January,"" said Bruce. “They’re both number nines. ""Andy Carroll has done great for us and he’s in better nick now than he’s been for the last few years.

We need more threat in wide areas, we need midfield players because we’re limited in there for numbers. “So we have to make tough decisions and believe me that was a really really tough decision because I know how popular Andy was with the fans and how popular he was in the dressing room. “But I’ve got to think of the overall balance of the squad.

Tchouameni has been coveted by a number of clubs around Europe with both Manchester United and Chelsea linked in recent months. The 22-year-old has played at every age group for France from under-16 all the way up to under-21 before making his first senior appearance in September last year. Would this season be a success if Liverpool won one out of four from here? Tchouameni completed a move from Bordeaux to Monaco in 2020 and has scored six goals in 92 appearances in all competitionsfor theMonégasques, from a mainly defensive midfield position. And now Liverpool – who have put a brilliant squad together in recent years – are ready to bid for the Frenchman this summer, according to Romano, with the Reds “targeting a new midfielder”. “Aurelien Tchouameni is certainly a player being monitored by Liverpool,”Romano wrote on Anfield Watch. “Who have had conversations with the agent of the Monaco midfielder. However, the €45 million price tag – set last summer – is no longer valid. A far higher offer will be needed to prise Tchouameni away from France. “But the 22-year-old is planning for a different experience this summer and that is undoubtedly why Liverpool may be ready to make their move. However, Real Madrid has been following Tchouameni for some time, and the Reds will face competition from other top clubs interested in the French international.” A deal for Fulham attacking midfielder Fabio Carvalho, which collapsed on deadline day in January, is understood to be close with Liverpool to pay “around£5m plus £2.7m in add-ons”. Romano added: “Klopp will also be involved in all the transfer decisions in the coming months and he has already given his green light for the signing of Fulham’sFabio Carvalho. The deal is already closed, the paperwork has been completed in recent days and there is no doubt: Carvalho will soon be announced as the first new signing of the 2022/2023 season, with a long-term contract until June 30, 2027. “The Portuguese talent has already been to the AXA Training Centre to meet with Klopp and he extensively explored Liverpool’s facilities before completing a medical – with Fulham’s permission. “Liverpool will pay around £5m plus £2.7m in add-ons, including a sell-on clause for 20% of Carvalho’s future sale. Liverpool faced competition from other clubs, who had tried to enter the race for his signature in February following the collapsed deal between Liverpool and Fulham on Deadline Day, for reasons of time in completing the contract. “But Carvalho has respected his agreement with the Reds, and the club themselves have an excellent relationship with Fulham after agreeing to keep the terms of the agreement reached in January instead of signing Carvalho on a free transfer this summer. The move has been particularly appreciated at Craven Cottage and future ties between the clubs are likely to be friendly. “Carvalho’s programme for the future is very clear: as things stand there is no planned return to Fulham on loan next season. Liverpool intend to keep Carvalho in the first team and consider him part of the group, but the final confirmation will come during pre-season after Klopp has the chance to assess his new midfielder.” ",positive,Liverpool,11

Ferdinand believes Diaz is vying to be one of Liverpool’s first-choice forwards: “Luis Diaz, the impact he’s had at Liverpool, and especially in the front areas,” Ferdinand said on his Five podcast. “We were saying before he came, ‘if one or two of them get injured up front, they’re going to be losing, the quality drops down dramatically’. When he starts, he’s probably vying now to be in the first three. “Like, Firmino would struggle to get in there, he [Diaz] probably gets in ahead of Jota now if they’re putting their best team in a Champions League final. That’s how much of an impact he’s made since he’s come. He has just been a breath of fresh air. You watch him play, on the ball he’s brilliant … but his reaction when they lose the ball is unreal. “He’s like a trigger, bang, go go and get it back. For those reasons, he’s the standout signing of the season for me.” Meanwhile,Peter Crouch thinks it’s between Liverpool forward Mo Salah and Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden for the PFA Player of the Year award: “This year, if Manchester City win the Premier League and Champions League, you would have to pick Phil Foden or Kevin De Bruyne. I’d potentially go for Foden because he has consistently been a shining light for them. “There are plenty of others you could choose and the same goes for Liverpool. The performances of Virgil van Dijk have been an absolute joke. Sadio Mane as well, coming back from winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal and picking up where he left off. He has to be in the conversation. “I do seem to be skirting around the fact that Mo Salah — already crowned FWA Footballer of the Year — has the most goals and assists this season.” ",positive,Liverpool,7
https://www.football365.com/news/ravanelli-spurs-premier-league-title-conte-manchester-united-new-defence,Ravanelli claims Spurs can win title next season and Man Utd need a ‘whole new defence’,"Fabrizio Ravanelli reckons Spurs can win the Premier League title next season but admits they will have to “fight hard” to achieve that under Antonio Conte. Tottenham have been much better in the second half of the campaign under Conte with the Italian replacing Nuno Espirito Santo at the beginning of November. Nuno left the club after they lost five of his last seven Premier League matches in charge with Spurs sitting ninth in the Premier League. Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Tottenham are now up to fifth under Conte, two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal with the race for the final Champions League spot well underway. And Middlesbrough legend Ravanelli reckons Spurs have a chance of winning the Premier League title next season with Conte at the helm. Ravanelli told The Sun: “I believe he has been doing very well at Tottenham but when a coach, especiallyConte, gets to a team, he needs time. I’m pretty sure he can make tremendous progress and achieve exactly what he has in mind. “Tottenhamhas always been missing something – they never really manage to take that necessary step forward in quality. They have had a good mentality but it’s not been effective in getting the results they want. “Now withConte and Fabio Paratici, they will be able to make the right choices to give them the right identity to win. They will be able to then possibly win thePremier Leaguein this way. Next year will be the turning point.” Ravanelli added: “This year they have less chance than Arsenal [to get top four] but knowing Conte, in these moments, he always wins duels. He is so focused and so determined and I’m pretty sure they will finish fourth and get into the Champions League. “As for winning the Premier League next year, they will have to fight hard. We cannot forget Manchester City and Liverpool. Tottenham have got seven or eight excellent players. “They need to focus on the defence because that is their main weakness. They would also need to strengthen the midfield with new signings and sign a new striker to play alongside Harry Kane. “Kane is the best but he is not enough so they will need to strengthen there next season. It won’t be easy.” Conte was linked with the Man Utd job before taking over at Spurs and Ravanelli reckons the Red Devils need huge changes in the summer to progress under Erik ten Hag. Ravanelli continued: “If Conte had had the possibility to work with theManchester Unitedplayers, certainly it would have been easier for him to achieve certain results. “United have many players who are not fit to wear the shirt or up to the expectation of winning the Premier League and Champions League. There should be some turnover of players. “I don’t want to be nasty but honest. Without naming specific players, the whole defence should be changed completely. It needs radical change. “I truly believe withErik ten Hag, a new cycle is about to start. He did really well at Ajax and enjoyed remarkable results. “He has always given great value to young players. If he starts working with the young players who understand what it means to play for United, they can make the difference and improve.” ",positive,Liverpool,1

The stars in question are James-Ward-Prowse and Jarrod Bowen. The latter has been linked with Liverpool in recent months. Bowen has been one of West Ham’s standout players this term both domestically and in Europe. He has grabbed 16 goals and eleven assists from his 47 outings across all competitions. Who thinks the Manchester United Treble beats a Liverpool Quadruple? Ward-Prowse meanwhile progressed through the ranks at Southampton. He has played over 350 times for the Saints. He has also featured ten times for England since he made his debut in 2017. The free-kick specialist has impressed for Southampton this term. He has contributed nine goals and five assists in the Premier League. Spanish outlet Fichajes are reporting that Ward-Prowse and Bowen are ‘covered by Ten Hag for his Man Utd.’ Ward-Prowse is ‘one of the first names’ on the Dutchman’s ‘agenda’, while it is noted that Bowen has been one of the ‘main Premier League revelations’ in recent seasons. The report adds that Ten Hag is also an admirer of Feyenoord left-back Tyrell Malacia who is rated at around€15m. Elsewhere, Gary Neville has insisted that Ten Hag should be expected to win the Premier League title in the fourth year of his reign at Man Utd. The Dutchman was confirmed as the new permanent Red Devils boss last month with interim manager Ralf Rangnick making way at the end of the season. “I said four to five years to win a title and I don’t disagree with Jamie’s timeline of Champions League in the first two seasons while he’s sorting the recruitment out and getting used to the club. “Third season getting very close, I think to the point whereby the club have got confidence and won a trophy maybe. “And then that fourth year really is where they have to win a title, fifth year. That’s where I think really you’re looking at the moment realistically. “We all hope he comes in and blows everyone away and that Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola blow up somehow. “But they’re not blowing up are they? They’re achieving the same numbers of points year in year out so if their consistency remains, which there’s no reason to say it won’t then Ten Hag’s got a massive job to make up that points gap.” ",positive,Liverpool,2

The former Republic of Ireland international played 480 times for the Red Devils over 13 seasons, winning seven Premier League titles, four FA Cups and a Champions League. He played alongside a number of amazing players during his time at Old Trafford and Sky Sports asked him to pick hisgreatest Man Utd XI of the Premier League era on their Monday Night Football show. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? Keane decided on a team of Peter Schmeichel; Gary Neville, Gary Pallister, Jaap Stam, Denis Irwin; David Beckham, Paul Ince, Bryan Robson, Ryan Giggs; Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo. And the Man Utd legend explained his decision to make Schmeichel the goalkeeper despite him not being “as good as everyone thought”. “I don’t like upsetting my team-mates,” Keane said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football. “I had to leave out some brilliant players, brilliant characters, but obviously I’ve done it. Edwin [Van der Sar] was nearly a sparring partner. “Goalkeepers get too much praise when they make a save. I had to go with Peter because he was very, very good – not as good as everyone thought, but very good. “And obviously, I have good memories with him. He was a good character in the dressing room – me and Peter certainly weren’t the best of mates, absolutely far from it, but the most important thing I had for Peter – and all of my team-mates – was huge respect. “He produced big moments and helped us get over the line in big matches, that’s the bottom line. Before you go into any match, you look over your shoulder at who’s in goal and you go, ‘yeah, I’m happy with him – we’ve got a chance.’ Peter would produce and help us get trophies.” Keane selected Stam and Pallister as his two centre-backs but he felt harsh leaving Ferdinand and Steve Bruce out of his XI. The former midfielder added: “Centre-back was probably the hardest one because Rio was excellent, Brucey was a good character. I just couldn’t leave Jaap Stam out. He didn’t play as many games as the other lads but he was big, strong, brave, brilliant at one-on-ones. “The other one was an issue but I’ve gone with Gary Pallister. I’d probably say [it was between Pallister and] Rio. Rio was obviously a good athlete and read the game well but my relationship with Pally was pretty good as well. “Did [Stam] have any real weaknesses? He could head it, he could leap, he could read the game, he was strong, aggressive, a decent lad. I got on really well with him. Unfortunately you try to move on, but Jaap was a brilliant player for Man United. Brucey was a good player and a brilliant player.” “We’d obviously play with a high line!” 🤣 David Beckham 🌟 Rooney 🙌 @GNev2 👀 Roy Keane reveals his ULTIMATE Man Utd Premier League XI 🤩 pic.twitter.com/7nhb19EljG — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 2, 2022 Scholes and Nicky Butt were two more Man Utd legends to miss out on Keane’s team but he just couldn’t see past Robson and Ince in centre midfield. Keane continued: “I’m certainly not going to pick myself. Bryan Robson has to go in there. Bryan was a great player for Man United, full of courage, scored some big goals for the club when Man United weren’t at their best. I had some brilliant days with Butty and Scholesy. “Next to Robbo, I’m going to put Paul Ince. Incey was a very, very good player. Maybe he tarnished his United reputation; he ended up playing at Liverpool or wherever. When he was at United, there was all talk of Incey being the governor. “People kind of held that against him but that was just banter, there was no nastiness with that. Incey was a really good teammate and a very good team-mate.” On leaving Cantona out, Keane said: “Eric was a brilliant player for Man United. I’m upset to leave Eric out.

After his spells at Real Madrid and Juventus, Ronaldo returned to the Red Devils last summer. A fee of around £13.5m plus add-ons was paid by Man Utd. The forward has been criticised by some this season but he has been one of few bright sparks for United. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong The 37-year-old scored his 24th goal of the season on Monday night as Man Utd beat Brentford 3-0 at Old Trafford. Carragher has often questioned United’s decision to re-sign Ronaldo and he did so again on Monday. He does not feel that they “should not be buying a 37-year-old”: “My problem has always been with Man United for buying Cristiano Ronaldo. One of the biggest clubs in the world should not be buying a 37-year-old,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “I’ve always been of the opinion that they should move him on, but right now, there are so many problems – ‘I need to get a midfielder, I need to get a centre-back.’ We’ve seen this season that when Ronaldo doesn’t play or gets brought off, it’s a massive story. “If you bring in strikers, are they to play or back up Ronaldo? If you’re the new manager, you might think you don’t need that on your plate. “They’ve got other problems. Would Liverpool ring back Luis Suarez? I don’t think so. United should be getting Erling Haaland. Man City are getting him. “It’s like United are a small club. It’s like when Rooney went back to Everton. It was just to lift the fans.” Carragher also thinks it’s “nonsense” that Ralf Rangnick will be managing Austria next season. The former Liverpool defender said on Sky Sports: “Ralf Rangnick isn’t really a manager, he’s a director of football, he’s someone who helps the coaches or builds the club. “I’ll be honest with you I just don’t get that. I don’t think you can be manager of Austria and work for Manchester United. “He can work for Manchester United in that role…well that’s wrong.

An own goal from James Tarkowski had the Clarets 1-0 down at Vicarage Road on Saturday before late goals from Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill turned the game on its head. The comeback victory lifted them five points clear of the relegation zone before Everton beat Chelsea 1-0 on Sunday to close the gap back up to two points. Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature Michael Jackson has now won three matches in a row as caretaker manager after Burnley sacked Sean Dyche last month but Keane thought their celebrations gotunnecessarily out of hand. Keane said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football: “Big win obviously to come from a goal down, you see the reaction there. Obviously I don’t mind the manager celebrating but when I see everyone hugging and kissing I think it’s just slightly over the top.” Presenter Dave Jones interjected: “These are big results at stake aren’t they?” Keane continued: “I know, I know. But there has been all season. I think Dyche would’ve got the same results I really do but, listen, the decision is made now but there’s been a good reaction.” Jones then touched on Burnley’s good form and asked Jamie Carragher if that trend is continuing, to which the former Liverpool defender replied: “Yeah, I mean, I think Roy is right, we said that last week. Sometimes a different voice, maybe a slight change, you think of the impact it has maybe had on Dwight McNeil. “He did a great job, Sean Dyche, but it’s something a little bit different. If you just look at the numbers, and of course we’re only talking about four games, so that can be skewed because that’s such a great start. “But when you see the points and the goals, there’s obviously a huge uplift there because they’ve had such a great start. But I think the thing you look at when you go down is goals conceded as well and that’s something you always looked at with Sean Dyche’s team. “I see everyone hugging and kissing – I think it’s slightly over the top” 😤 Roy Keane was NOT happy with these Burnley celebrations ❌ pic.twitter.com/dH1Zhksa7E — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 2, 2022 “But, as I said, it’s only four games. The possession is slightly up. Percentage of passes long, a slight difference, we saw that in the goal last week when we went through the goals, you know, playing through the lines a bit more. “And the 10 plus pass sequences is a real big jump. So it looks like the manager is trying to put his own stamp on it. He’s going to try and keep the good things of Sean Dyche, keeping it right, but they’re playing a bit more football. “So they’ve almost changed slightly to play a bit more football, shall we say…”  ",positive,Liverpool,1

The Englishman is out of contract this summer and he has barely featured for the Red Devils this season. Newcastle United attempted to sign him in January but Man Utd’s hierarchy prevented this deal from happening. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? It was reported on Monday afternoon that AC Milan and Juventus are ‘leading the chase’ to sign Lingard on a free transfer. The 29-year-old was an unused substitute as United beat Brentford 3-0 on Monday night. Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane got the goals. After the game, Lingard’s brother – Louie Scott – took to Instagram to criticise United for their treatment of the midfielder: “20 years of blood sweat and tears, four domestic trophies, three cup final goals, not even a farewell. No wonder it’s Conference League next year,” Scott said (quotes via The Mirror). “Attacking players for celebrations when the club’s being sold to the super league OK. “Class of ’92, Busby Babes, you’re run by people who don’t even know the offside trap.

Monday marked a year since the postponement of the Red Devils’ home clash against Liverpool, when fans made their anger at the ownership clear in the wake of the European Super League debacle. F365 says: Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong Supporters have protested at each of United’s final three home games and the anti-Glazer sentiment was clear before and during the victory against Brentford at Old Trafford. This was the first match that Thomas Frank’s Bees had lost with Christian Eriksen in the starting line-up and there were times before and after Bruno Fernandes’ early opener that the Dane threatened to unlock the hosts. A narrow offside decision denied Cristiano Ronaldo before half-time, but the veteran would get on the scoresheet after converting the spot-kick foolishly given away by Rico Henry. Raphael Varane hooked home a deflected third as fans gave standing ovations to departing Nemanja Matic and Juan Mata as they were substituted on their final Old Trafford appearances. There were renewed chants against the Glazers in the 73rd minute, when a few departed rather than the mass exodus planned ahead of a huge summer in every department at United. Brentford may find the scoreline hard to swallow given the impressive moments they showed during their first competitive match at Old Trafford since 1975. Eriksen pulled the strings from the outset and put Bryan Mbeumo behind dozy Alex Telles in the opening seconds of a match that saw the Stretford End applaud the Denmark international at their first corner. Brentford played with confidence under the Old Trafford floodlights but United would strike an early blow, with Diogo Dalot sending Anthony Elanga scampering down the right. The 20-year-old – one of few bright spots for United this term – fizzed over a cross that Fernandes crashed home in the ninth minute. Eriksen attempted to catch out David De Gea with a snapshot when Brentford returned to the attack and provided a brilliant cross that Ivan Toney headed over from close range. While the Brentford playmaker probed, Ronaldo was proving a handful at the other end. From backheels to forcing David Raya into an awkward save from a long-range free-kick, then furiously claiming he should have had a penalty following Mads Bech Sorensen’s challenge. Referee Chris Kavanagh was unmoved. Next Ronaldo smartly flicked into Mata, who lashed narrowly wide of the near post on his first Premier League start of the season. Mbeumo flashed wide as the Bees swarmed forward and Eriksen continued to impress, only for United to celebrate a second. Mata broke down the left and sent a low cross that Ronaldo squeezed past Raya. Provider and scorer celebrated together, only for the goal to be ruled out following a VAR review. That decision gave Brentford renewed hope of a famous result and De Gea denied Eriksen’s stinging 30-yard free-kick in the second half, then stopped Toney with his feet. But it was not all one-way traffic and Raya tipped a Dalot effort onto the woodwork after a one-two with Ronaldo, who had strayed offside in the build-up. Fernandes fizzed across the face of goal having been found by Matic before United created breathing space in the 61st minute. Ronaldo was bundled over in the box by Henry and the veteran sent Raya the wrong way in front of an elated Stretford End. There were standing ovations for Matic and Mata as they were substituted in the final home match before their contracts expire, with the latter able to celebrate a third goal before being replaced. Pontus Jansson nearly turned a Ronaldo cross into his own goal but it went behind for a corner, which Telles swung over for Varane to hook in via a deflection. The planned walk out 17 minutes from time saw some exit but not the masses some expected as flares filled the air and chants increased in volume.

It’s a back three for the worst XI according to WhoScored ratings… GK: Illan Meslier – 5.40 The Leeds keeper has been the busiest in the Premier League this season and once again he was exposed by his defence against City. Meslier couldn’t do much about any of the four goals he conceded, even if Gary Neville felt he should have done better with Fernandinho’s strike in added time.  CB: Mads Bech Sorensen – 5.62 One of Brentford’s three centre-backs won only one of the four duels he competed and failed to make a tackle while Manchester United used their last home game of the season to finally look vaguely competent.  CB: Luke Ayling – 5.53 The Leeds skipper lost possession 19 times while being dribbled past six times by a Manchester City player. Ayling also came off second best in eight of the 13 duels he engaged in.  CB: Romain Saiss – 5.59 All of Wolves’ three centre-backs rated lower than 6 in the 3-0 defeat to Brighton, with Willy Boly earning 5.72 and Conor Coady given 5.95. But Saiss scored lowest of the lot after giving away a penalty and losing possession 20 times. The Moroccan attempted 10 long passes, finding a team-mate with none of them.  Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving  RWB: Raphinha – 5.81 Stuart Dallas rated lower on 5.79 but the Cookstown Cafu suffered a serious injury in Leeds’ defeat to City and we’re not monsters. So Raphinha gets the nod after dropping back to right wing-back after Dallas was carried off. The Brazilian lost possession 21 times, failing in both of his attempted dribbles, finding a team-mate with only one of six attempted crosses.  LWB: Rico Henry – 5.18 No tackles, clearances, blocks or interceptions from the Brentford wing-back in the defeat at Old Trafford, where he lost a battle of strength with Cristiano Ronaldo before losing the battle of wits by bundling the Portuguese star to the ground in the box.  MF: Christian Norgaard – 5.92 Seven Brentford starters rated less than six at Old Trafford, with only Henry and Sorensen earning a lower score than Norgaard. The midfielder has made more tackles than anyone else in the Premier League this season but the Dane was quiet at Old Trafford, managing only two tackles before being hooked on 70 minutes. His replacement, Mathias Jensen, earned exactly the same score in his 20-minute cameo.  MF: Leander Dendoncker – 5.83 Ruben Neves got the half-time hook, just when Man Utd turned up to watch the Portuguese, but Dendoncker rated lowest of the Wolves midfielders. The Belgian drifted right before the break in a vain attempt to stop Marc Cucuerella and Leandro Trossard.Dendoncker was sloppy in possession and struggled to get close enough to Brighton to break up their play.  AMF: Joe Willock – 5.84 Jurgen Klopp rotated his midfield at Newcastle but still Liverpool were too strong for the Magpies. Willock was especially quiet, managing only 19 touches while losing possession as often as he found a team-mate with a pass (seven times) before he was replaced with a quarter of the game still remaining.  FWD: Raul Jimenez – 5.80 We usually give substitutes a pass, but Jimenez had the entire second half to make an impact and the Mexican struggled as much as Fabio Silva (5.95). Jimenez failed to attempt a shot on Brighton’s goal and lost possession more times (11) than he found a team-mate with a pass (10).  FWD: Rodrigo – 5.92 The Leeds forward ploughed a lone furrow for 83 minutes but failed to trouble the City defence. The one occasion he escaped Pep Guardiola’s back four, when Aymeric Laporte slipped in the opening minutes, Rodrigo got lost on the half-pitch race to Ederson’s goal, took a touch too many and wasted Leeds’ best chance before City turned the screw.

https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-ten-players-down-back-premier-league-sofa-thriving-gomez,Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving,"As the Premier League season enters its final weeks, clubs have started looking deeper into their squads to find a few hidden first-team gems. 10) Juan Mata (Manchester United) The sofa is knackered and living off past glories, while the item dredged from its innards is a little wornand being imminently shifted, but it remains perfectly serviceable and somehow incredibly handsome for an inanimate object. Juan Mata joined the reigning Premier League champions for a club-record fee and will leave them stranded in the Europa League, yet the Spaniard’s reputation has not been even vaguely damaged by eight-and-a-half years wasted at Old Trafford. It seemed to take Manchester United that long and almost as many managers to figure out how best to utilise Mata, who excelled as a No.10 against Brentford on his 15th Premier League start in the last three seasons. Considering those who have been permitted to float around in the sea of mediocrity and been rewarded, his relative lack of recent use has been startling. This renaissance itself is pointless, coming as it does so soon before his departure as a free agent. Yet the contrast between how well Manchester United play with Mata in the side compared to their disjointed performances without a player of his calibre remains telling.  9)Fabian Delph (Everton)The use of players on deals with a looming expiration date can often be polarising. But Everton supporters will likely give no second thought to Fabian Delph’s contract status, provided he continues to help in their quest for survival. The midfielder started three of 19 Premier League matches under Rafael Benitez and none of Duncan Ferguson’s single-game interim reign. Frank Lampard appreciates the “honesty” of a two-time title winner and hoped in April that Delph would be capable of “carrying on with what he did against Manchester United” before necessary discussions over his future were held. The 32-year-old has held up his end of the bargain, replicating those leadership qualities and defensive instincts that thwarted United in a 1-0 win at Goodison Park to secure the same result against Chelsea. Delph also started the 1-1 draw at home to Leicester and will retain that starting place provided his hamstrings hold up.  8)Tim Iroegbunam (Aston Villa)“I thought Tim had some really good moments today. I think you can see the profile, what he is going to become,” said Steven Gerrard, who added after Tim Iroregbunam’s full senior debut against Norwich: “We need him to realise that he is a first-team player. He needs to use his voice more, he needs to keep pushing himself on a daily basis.” There are worse former Premier League midfielders to receive constructive praise from. A cynic might argue thatIroregbunam’s reward for being able to “out-train certain individuals” was timed impeccably for the visit of Norwich, yet the 18-year-old embraced the challenge and further smoothed that pathway Jacob Ramsey first trod. Iroegbunam was upgraded from four Premier League minutes against Brighton in February to a quarter of an hour at Leicester and then a start in the Norwich victory, having been an unused substitute in 14 of the prior 16 fixtures. He failed to make the squad altogether in the other two; that is unlikely to happen again soon.   7)Nathan Collins (Burnley)The alchemy of Sean Dyche might have wavered at Turf Moor but the last season of signings during his reign could have established Burnley’s spine for the next few years. Maxwel Cornet and Wout Weghorst have finally added some new dimensions to the attack, while Aaron Lennon and Wayne Hennessey have been useful enough as elder statesmen. But the purchases of Championship prospects Connor Roberts and Nathan Collins may be the most important of all; both were eased into the side and neither look likely to relinquish their places. Collins has been a particularly influential arrival. Burnley have won five and drawn four of the 14 Premier League games he has started; they have won two and drawn nine of the 20 he has not. Dyche never gave the centre-half more than three consecutive starts but Collins has not missed a single minute of Mike Jackson and company’s caretaker reign. The 21-year-old’s impact has even allowed Ben Mee to step comfortably into that role and the forthcoming exit of James Tarkowski need no longer be of great concern. The reimagining of Burnley’s defence has already started.  6)Oleksandr Zinchenko (Manchester City)The third signing of Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City tenure still has his uses to the Spaniard almost six years later. His first, Ilkay Gundogan, has become a midfield lynchpin at the Etihad, while Nolito was the opening transfer misfire of this monumental reign. Oleksandr Zinchenko’s first-team relevance has never been particularly settled – the most appearances the Ukrainian has ever made in a single Premier League season is 20 – but he can still be relied upon when needed. That has been a little less often this season. Fifteen starts in all competitions represents a low return for Zinchenko, whose Manchester City minutes for the campaign rank in between those of the similarly peripheral Nathan Ake and the fading Fernandinho. The only teams to beat Guardiola’s side when Zinchenko has started are West Ham, Leipzig and Liverpool, stretched across three different competitions. As the season reaches suffocatingly pressurised levels at the top, the 25-year-old can still slot in at a moment’s notice with no discernible detriment in quality.  5) Joe Gomez (Liverpool)The full circle that has been Joe Gomez under Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool is close to completion. Injuries scuppered the defender’s development initially and are the primary reason for his current role as dual back-up. When the German first brought Gomez, it was as a right-back in 2017/18, designed to eventually share the right-back position with Trent Alexander-Arnold by the end of the season. His current status seems to be generally restricted to filling in when the Liverpool academy product needs a rest. Perhaps next he will rekindle the fruitful centre-back partnership with Virgil van Dijk upon which the Reds won the Premier League title. The list of clubs Gomez has started against is revealing: Milan, Benfica, Watford, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest, Preston, Leicester and Norwich three times. It reflects his bit-part function in this winning machine. But Klopp has challenged his squad players to be “ready for the moment when the situation changes” and throughout his regular appraisals of those on the fringes, Gomez is almost always the first to be mentioned. The 24-year-old would start in most other Premier League defences; serving consistent time on the Anfield sidelines will not be a permanent arrangement either way. 4)Mads Bech Sorensen (Brentford)Sixteen Brentford players have featured more often than Mads Bech Sorensen so far this season, but the Danish centre-half might slowly be rising to prominence. Before Boxing Day his campaign was limited to 19 minutes of the opening win against Arsenal. He then started three straight games until January 2, was benched for a couple more matches and returned to face Manchester United as February approached. Ten consecutive fixtures either on the bench or out of the squad altogether followed, before Ethan Pinnock’s injury at Watford opened a first-team door that had been irregularly blowing barely ajar for months. Sorensen finished that Vicarage Road victory, retained his place in the goalless draw against Tottenham and was arguably the best Brentford defender on show at Manchester United, even if that bar remains low in a 3-0 defeat. He,Saman Ghoddos andMads Roerslev have been critical utility players who might have earned Thomas Frank’s trust during their respective stop-start campaigns.  3)Nathaniel Clyne (Crystal Palace)It has been a curious few years for Nathaniel Clyne. Brendan Rodgers signed one of the Premier League’s most dependable right-backs for Liverpool in 2015, and while Klopp might have been plotting an internal upgrade at some point, it was injury that eventually took him out of the side. A back problem suffered in summer 2017 effectively ended Clyne’s time as a regular starter; another pre-season injury, this time to his cruciate knee ligament in July 2019, signalled his quiet farewell the following year. The 31-year-old had left Crystal Palace for Southampton in 2012 but came back as a free agent and trialist by October 2020, training with his former club to regain fitness and soon a 12-month contract that was renewed last August. Clyne has had to accept a subsidiary role under both Roy Hodgson and Patrick Vieira; he didn’t feature in the Premier League from February to December 2021. But an injury to Joel Ward presented an opening that has reinvigorated the erstwhile England international’s career. Clyne’s current run of 10 consecutive Premier League starts is his longest in five years and an enduring testament to his fortitude. Even if Palace intend on sourcing an improvement at right-back in the transfer market, they could do worse than renew Clyne’s terms as a trustworthy reserve. Nathaniel Clyne appreciation tweet The guy doesn’t stop trying, goes about his business quietly, and has been absolutely solid for us Proper palace ❤️💙 pic.twitter.com/rOfwPYvqRH — Benj (@Beniesta_) April 30, 2022   2)Moises Caicedo (Brighton)Graham Potter perhaps understood the unique pressure of having to live up to such a daunting Barclays surname. Felipe Caicedo struck terror into the heart of Premier League defences for two years at Manchester City and surnamesake Moises would have to carry that burden for the rest of his career. Brighton signed the midfielder for £4.5m in February 2021, sat him on the bench as an unused substitute in five Premier League and FA Cup games, nodded astutely as his Ecuador side reached the Copa America quarter-finals, then sent him on loan to Beerschot in Belgium for some season-long fine-tuning. Except Caicedo would return to the coast sooner than planned. An injury to Enock Mwepu and the loss of Yves Bissouma to Africa Cup of Nations duty led to a midfield shortage at Brighton, the solution to which was a January recall for Caicedo. The Seagulls battled through that period regardless and only for the trip to Arsenal did the 20-year-old finally get his long-awaited debut. Brighton’s seven-game winless run was curtailed at the Emirates as Caicedo shone, assisting one goal and displaying the sort of quality Potter has found impossible to resist since. The midfielder has started each of the subsequent four matches as the next stage of Brighton’s transformation comes into full view.  1) Mo Elneny (Arsenal)“Maybe there wasn’t a lot of competition because we were the only club interested in signing him. Not too many people spoke about him and he was basically not much on the radar,” said Arsene Wenger, really milking the excitement of the Arsenal fanbasein January 2016. Plenty of teams have pursued the Egyptian since, from Leicester to Galatasaray and, most recently, Newcastle. A productive year was spent at Besiktas, yet the Turkish giants thought better of exercising their buy option. And so Elneny returned in summer 2020, farmed out under Unai Emery and inherited by Mikel Arteta. The Spaniard has consummate faith in Elneny to deliver when called upon. He started the Community Shield final win over Liverpool almost two years ago, as well as wins at Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge. Heading into this season it was believed that the midfielder would finally leave, yet even when Arteta culled the squad with ruthless abandon, he knew Elneny would be needed at some point. The Egyptian’s only Premier League starts this campaign have come against Manchester United (twice), Chelsea and West Ham and no player has been more crucial to their turnaround over the past fortnight. Elneny’s contract is scheduled to expire this summer but, by his own admission: “If Arsenal say ‘we want you’ I don’t think about leaving. It’s my family for six years. I love this club.'” Arteta will reciprocate that fondness; he could not find a better or more committed and reliable squad option if he tried.  ",positive,Liverpool,6
https://www.football365.com/news/champions-league-preview-ancelotti-liverpool-west-ham-abraham,"Big Midweek: Carlo ‘The Don’ Ancelotti, Liverpool, Tammy Abraham, Frankfurt v West Ham","A likely Liverpool procession, Carlo ‘The Don’ Ancelotti, one of the many Chelsea lads to get away and West Ham head to Frankfurt. We preview a Big Midweek of European semi-final action… Game to watch: Eintracht Frankfurt v West Ham It’s a huge game for both sides. Frankfurt have a one-goal advantage as they look to book their place in a first European final for 41 years, while the Hammers’ wait has been five years longer still. David Moyes’ side weren’t quite at it in the first leg. They weren’t overawed per se, but looked a bit taken aback by Frankfurt, who produced an excellent away performance. West Ham should be reasonably well rested as Moyes has shuffled his pack in the Premier League and they need to be at their assertive, physical best to make it through. The importance of winning this game, and then the final, isn’t limited to the joy of winning, though that is obviously the most important thing. Both clubs have players in the shop window who want, and have the quality, to be playing European football, and all face the prospect of that not being the case if they remain with their respective clubs. Frankfurt are tenth in the Bundesliga and completely out of the running for European qualification. West Ham currently sit in the Europa Conference League spot in the Premier League, which is lovely, but quite possibly not enough for Declan Rice, or perhaps Jarrod Bowen, both of whom have the quality to be playing at the very highest level.They’ve played a huge part in West Ham getting this far, but could well be off should they not take them all the way.  Team to watch: Liverpool Liverpool are playing football like they’re a driver on a boring stretch of motorway. The monotony makes you forget hours of driving to the extent that you wonder whether you’ve been asleep at the wheel, but you’re still there, getting closer and closer to a destination that seemed an impossible dream when you set off. Tuesday’s second leg against Villarreal will be Liverpool’s 58th game of the season. They’ve won 44 of them and lost just three, including the 1-0 second-leg defeat to Inter Milan which ultimately didn’t matter. They’ve been tediously brilliant, with so many of those games forgettable as they blend into one. Trent Alexander-Arnold plays some unbelievable passes, one or more of their five outstanding forwards has an outstanding game, the opposition get caught offside 25 times and Alisson gets them out of jail when he needs to. OK guys, fine, we get it! Unai Emery said his side have to be “perfect” to overcome the two-goal deficit, but they also need Liverpool to have a bit of a shocker, and they just haven’t at any point this season. The baying Yellow Submarine fans can have an impact, but the combination of skill, know-how and maturity in Jurgen Klopp’s side is unmatched in world football, other than perhaps Manchester City, and it’s hard to see anything but the usual, mind-numbingly excellent routine.  Manager to watch: Carlo Ancelotti Ancelotti, who became the first manager to win all of the ‘big five’ league titles over the weekend, will move above Bob Paisley and Zinedine Zinedine to stand alone as the only manager to win four European Cups/Champions League titles should he take Madrid all the way this year. Given they will have to beat Manchester City in the second leg, and then likely Liverpool in the final to achieve the feat, it doesn’t feel likely. But then nothing about their run this season has been likely. Real Madrid have smashed and grabbed their way to this point in the Champions League. It feels as though they’ve been the better team for about half a game of football combined in the knockout phase so far. They’ve seen off eminently superior Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea sides and are somehow within touching distance of Manchester City having been battered in the first leg at the Etihad. In the five knockout legs combined, Ancelotti’s side have scored 11 goals from an xG of 5.5; their opponents have scored ten goals from an xG of 11.76… Ancelotti, mehn. What a legend. pic.twitter.com/d1E0LAP0Lj — Luis Miguel Echegaray (@lmechegaray) May 1, 2022  There’s been a spattering of Luka Modric genius, but their progress has relied hugely on Karim ‘The Dream’ Benzema,who’s scored 14 goals in the competition at a ridiculous rate of one every 65 minutes. The striker was rested as Madrid clinched the La Liga title on Saturday, still managing to score as a second-half substitute, as Ancelotti saved his 34-year-old legs ahead of the clash at the Bernabeu on Wednesday. Ancelotti isn’t one to overthink games of football like Pep Guardiola, and there’s a sense this year that he’s embraced the chaos that can give his team the advantage. He backs his star players, and one in particular, to win the big moments and score goals at key times. And it’s hard not to root for this Real Madrid side, firstly because they’re so damn entertaining, and secondly because Ancelotti is a gentleman, a scholar and an absolute Don.  Player to watch: Tammy Abraham If embarrassment was no factor, Chelsea would currently be heavily linked with a move for Tammy Abraham. 24 goals so far this season, a lover of and loved by Jose Mourinho, someone who ‘knows the club’, with Premier League experience. It would be a ‘no-brainer’ that ultimately, inevitably, would end with the assertion that perhaps brains were in fact necessary. He, like Romelu Lukaku, isn’t suited to Thomas Tuchel’s system, but Mourinho is making the most of him. It’s been Abraham’s link-up play, along with his goals, that’s been so impressive, and was the talking point and social media obsession after the 1-1 draw at Leicester in the first leg. Tammy Playmaking 🎨@tammyabraham pic.twitter.com/Vs2aca7yxA — ASRomaComps (@roma_comps) April 29, 2022  And with the renewed confidence and form that has put him in with a very decent shout of heading to the World Cup in Qatar with England this winter, few would bet against the 24-year-old being the scourge of Brendan Rodgers’ side again on Thursday night.  EFL game to watch: Bournemouth v Nottingham Forest Those of you who don’t fancy watching a Liverpool procession on Tuesday can instead turn your attention to what could be the Championship automatic promotion decider. When Steve Cooper took charge of Forest eight games into the season, on September 21, they were bottom of the table on four points; Bournemouth were top on 18. Forest are now third and should they win at the Vitality Stadium, will swap places with Bournemouth, pulling the Cherries out of the automatic promotion spots for the first time since the day Cooper arrived. The closest Premier League equivalent would be Dean Smith taking Norwich to the Champions League having taken over from Daniel Farke. There is no superlative grand enough to describe how good Cooper has been.   European game to watch: Salernitana v Venezia It looks like it’s going to the wire at the top and bottom of Serie A. While the Milan clubs battle for the title, four clubs are vying for 17th spot to avoid relegation. It’s Salernitana in 18th against Venezia in 20th on Thursday and the away side desperately need a win. Venezia are six points off Cagliari and safety with four games to play, having not picked up a single point since mid-February after a shocking nine defeats on the bounce.Salernitana have a better chance of avoiding the drop – they sit just three points behind Cagliari with two games in hand.

https://www.football365.com/news/man-utd-midfield-targets-rice-gravenberch-tchouameni-haidara-phillips,Man Utd’s five midfield targets: the cases for and against,"Manchester United’s priority for the summer transfer window is said to be a central midfielder. But which one? Here are some of the arguments for and against five of the most often linked targets… Declan Rice For The England international has proved himself to be just the man United need to anchor their midfield. Rice initially carved out a reputation as a screener and this season has shown his credentials as a box-to-boxer. Rice has made more interceptions than anyone in the top flight and only Brentford’s Christian Norgaard has made more combined tackles and interceptions than the 23-year-old’s total of 147. There seems very little risk with Rice. United know exactly what they would be getting and that certainty usually comes at a premium. About that… Against United will have to break their transfer record and almost certainly the Premier League’s for most expensive signing if they want to get Rice out of West Ham. The player would almost certainly like to take the next step (assuming it’s not a lateral move between West Ham and United come the end of the season) and the Irons, under no pressure to offload with Rice under contract until 2025, could sell a huge deal to their fanbase. But that would require United to cough up in excess of £100million. Would they do that, especially if they aren’t in the Champions League next season? United might find themselves shopping with a tighter budget.   Kalvin Phillips For If United can’t get Rice, perhaps they might opt for his mate in England’s midfield. Phillips’ quality has been emphasised by how badly he’s been missed by Leeds during his recent injury-enforced absence. He’s not the only player Marcelo Bielsa and Jesse Marsch have been without, but Phillips seems like the biggest miss, especially given the way opponents have played through the Leeds midfield when he’s not manning the engine room. Even if Leeds appear to be on a firmer footing in the Premier League after two dramatic wins last week, the Whites’ finances could make them susceptible to offers on Phillips. Reports suggest he could go for £60million, which may be around half the price of Rice. Against A few clubs are said to be keen on Phillips, with Liverpool, Man City, Newcastle and Aston Villa all credited with an interest. Indeed, Villa are reported to be leading the race. If Phillips is ushered towards the door by Leeds while his hometown club seeks a windfall, then the 26-year-old will have to consider very carefully his next move if he wants to protect a legacy he’s cultivated at Elland Road as one of their own. Crossing the Pennines would tarnish that. Alan Smith made that move when Leeds were on the bones of their arse and they still haven’t really forgiven him in West Yorkshire. Indeed, it was reported last year that Phillips has already decided not to risk it. So United might be wise not to chase a lost cause. Of all those reportedly interested in Phillips this summer, I am told West Ham and Aston Villa are the only clubs to make enquiries so far. WHUFC remain interested following their January offers and AVFC CEO Purslow is a longtime admirer of Kalvin. As of now, no contact from MUFC — Jonathan Shrager (@JonathanShrager) March 22, 2022   Ryan Gravenberch For Gravenberch remains a teenager but has already amassed almost 100 appearances for Ajax and 10 caps for Holland. By the end of the season, he will have played almost four full senior campaigns before his 20th birthday. According to his former youth coach with the Amsterdam club, the deep-lying midfielder is “a better version of Paul Pogba” with the physique of Frank Rijkaard. Gravenberch’s career so far has been spent under the wing of Erik ten Hag. If United opt to name the Ajax coach as their new manager, then there would be sense in having him bring a player he knows better than anyone else can claim to. He would be half the price of Phillips and around a quarter of the cost Rice might be, which is important now. Against United’s last move for an Ajax midfielder was hardly a roaring success. Perhaps that is why Gravenberch is said to be lukewarm about the prospect of moving to Old Trafford, especially with Bayern Munich keen. Apparently, Gravenberch would prefer to hear first what the Bavarians have to say and the story goes that personal terms have already been agreed. All Bayern must do is find common ground with Ajax over a fee and their opening offer of £21million wasn’t too far from achieving its purpose. United may well be wasting their time putting Gravenberch at the top of their list of targets if he really is edging closer to Bayern. Where would you rather go right now?  Amadou Haidara For Ralf Rangnick certainly thought United would suit Haidara since he recommended that the club move on the Mali international in January. They decided not to because, well, United. The interim manager knows Haidara well from his time at RB Leipzig. It was Rangnick who took him to Germany from Salzburg and Haidara established himself as an important player for Julian Nagelsmann, Marsch and now Domenico Tedesco. Haidara can screen but Rangnick wanted him because of his ability to press further up the pitch. We assume United’s new coach will want to play a similar style to that which Rangnick has struggled to implement with the current squad and Haidara would certainly improve those prospects. In contrast to Gravenberch and Phillips, the prospect of playing for United arouses Haidara. “My dream club is Manchester United,” he said in 2019. Though plenty has happened since which may have prompted a rethink. Against Rangnick’s opinion presumably hasn’t been founded on Haidara’s stats. In the Bundesliga alone: 109 players have attempted more tackles; 195 have a higher tackle success rate than Haidara’s 22.6 per cent; 113 players have applied more pressures; and 27 have a higher pressure success rate. For comparison, Scott McTominay’s tackle success percentage is 49.2 per cent and Fred’s is 25.4 per cent, which is the worst in the United squad, but still better than Haidara’s.  Aurelien Tchouameni For United are just one of the clubs interested in Tchouameni. Apparently, so too are Chelsea, City and Liverpool. Plus other big hitters on the continent. But the 22-year-old reportedly has the Premier League in mind for when he leaves Monaco. Tchouameni was Ligue 1’s best young player last season and already has seven France caps to his name. So impressive has he been while standing in for N’Golo Kante, Pogba said: “We wish him to play a lot more games and that I am always by his side.” There is almost no chance of the pair teaming up at Old Trafford, butTchouameni could pick up a lot quicker the instructions of a new manager than Pogba and his team-mates have shown they are able or willing to over the years. “In his position, you need to be disciplined and organise others around you,” said then-Monaco coach Niko Kovac. “He is always trying to learn and understand. He absorbs all the information we give to him.” Tchouameni wouldn’t break the bank for United, with a reported asking price of £42million within the Red Devils’ budget this summer, even if they are tightening their belts. Against Technically and tactically, there is no reason United shouldn’t go forTchouameni this summer. He’s within budget, young but gathering experience quick and only getting better. But, of course, United are not the only club keen on the 22-year-old. Given how United hate losing face, will they really be prepared to go up against the likes of City and Liverpool when their rivals can offer Champions League football when they most likely cannot? That’s not to say they shouldn’t move decisively overTchouameni – just don’t expect them to.  ",positive,Liverpool,3
https://www.football365.com/news/mailbox-liverpool-quadruple-man-utd-rangnick-brentford,Would this season be a success if Liverpool won one out of four from here?,"The Mailbox ponders how Liverpool’s season will be viewed if they don’t win any of the three remaining trophies they are going for this month. Get your views in to theeditor@football365.com… What qualifies as Liverpool success? I think it’s pretty crazy that Liverpool could finish the season as FA Cup finalists, champs league finalists, runner up in the league and winner of the league cup and pretty much every fan will think of it as a failed season. Myself included. By any other standard any two of those four achievements is a superb season for 99% of teams. Which I guess highlights just how high Klopp has raised our expectations now. I said after we drew with city that the title was gone. That was a must win game. My friends (also reds) said I was pessimistic and city would def drop points along the way and we would win every game. Winning every game for us at that point would mean a 14 game winning streak, one of the longest in club history. So far we’ve done that. But pep just knows how to put giant runs together and looking at the calendar at the time I couldn’t see any teams taking points off city. Still don’t. 4 games left and it’s looking ever more likely that the season will finish with city being one point above us and that game Vs city being a costly one (though really any game we dropped points is just as costly). But I genuinely believe (as objectively as I can) that we will win a cup treble this season. Regardless of who makes it to the final it will be a very tough game with either two teams who play fast attacking football and a high tempo pressure game filled with talented players or Liverpool against a team of dark arts masters who are older than the Bible with twice the staying power. Would other Liverpool fans be disappointed with a cup treble? I want to say no but I know in my heart of hearts that that premier League trophy is the one we really want. I’d swap the champs league for the premier League this year for sure. I shouldn’t be disappointed, especially considering only a few years ago we almost ceased to exist. But I know that pang of regret will be there anyway…Lee  Eye on the ballIsaac, believe me, my eye is very much on the ball. I am making no assumptions about Liverpool winning their last 4 games. In fact in my mail on Sunday I said it was a real possibility that they wouldn’t. I am very worried about the game against Tottenham, just as I was worried about the Newcastle game, worried about the Man United game, worried about the Everton game and worried about pretty much every other game Liverpool play. I do find the comment about the ‘ridiculous’ concern from Liverpool fans about where City could drop points slightly odd though. Isn’t that what football fans do? Are Spurs, Arsenal, Leeds, Burnley, & Everton fans not scouring the fixtures list to see where points may be won and lost? Seriously, if you’re not doing that are you even a real football fan?Mike, LFC, London   Everton relegation bad for Man City Not only would Everton’s relegation be bad for the city it would also be bad news for Manchester City. As it stands City only have the Manchester derby as the game where “form goes out of the window” but Liverpool have two, with the Merseyside derby and the rivalry with United. It is rare that Liverpool actually do the double over Everton (this season aside) and it is hard to imagine a promoted team taking points off them. With the margin between the two being so small, Everton’s relegation might make all the difference next season and (perish the thought) beyond.CDM  Departing manager bounce 29th of April – Rangnick appointed Austria manager for next season. 2nd May, Man United play their first convincing game of Rangnick’s tenure, displaying flair, composure, and effort. It turns out these players can play, and they can defend, and score goals too. Coincidence? Or motivation? And if you believe it was ‘just Brentford’ consider that if United had played this way and won all the games we played against teams in the bottom half of the premiership we would have had 16 points more. Contrary to popular opinion, this team doesn’t need surgery. It needs a spark.Ved Sen, MUFC.  Ralf finds the formula Man Utd finally played good football. Huge shout outs to Mata & Matic. All the others players have 100% and it showed. Is it a coincidence Man Utd plays good football without Maguire & Rashford? The former simply doesn’t deserve to be in a top six team, the latter is a footballer turned book writer who can’t be bothered to run on a football pitch. If only Ralf had found this formula earlier. CheersAshwin – Man Utd fan  Where did all the nicknames go? Two things which have been rolling around in my head recently – What ever happened to nicknames for players? It feels like they are not as prominent anymore. In the past, here in sunny and loadshedded South Africa, we had wonderful nicknames for players like Ace, Computer, and my favourite, Lucas ‘Masterpieces’ Moripe. According to Wikipedia, Steven Gerrard is referred to as the ‘Hammer of Huyton’. I can’t recall ever singing for the ‘Hammer’. ‘Scores from forty yards’, uncountable times. Was he referred to as the Hammer at all up in England? I know Luis Suarez went by ‘El pistolero’ but this seemed to be more widely used for him in Uruguay? Maybe Salah’s ‘Egyptian King’ moniker might currently be applicable but in truth, are nicknames still assigned? I’d love if we could start calling them James ‘the Anvil’ Milner and Joel ‘Pureclass’ Matip. My second mental wandering I confine to brackets.

Tchouameni is on the wishlists of a number of top European clubs, including Manchester United and Chelsea, but Liverpool have also entered the fray. MAILBOX: If Mo Salah was white he would get twice as many fouls. And other opinions… The 22-year-old midfielder has been a stalwart for Monaco since his £16m move from Bordeaux in the summer of 2020. The Times claim ‘the clever recruitment of the likes of Luis Díaz, Diogo Jota and Ibrahima Konaté in recent transfer windows has maintained the club’s forward momentum by freshening up the squad and that approach is likely to continue’. The report continues, ‘they like Monaco’s Aurélien Tchouaméni, although they are aware the France international is attracting interest from Real Madrid. Whether they press ahead with interest depends on a number of factors, including price, but it would be a midfielder with a similar profile to the powerful Tchouaméni that they would target should he be out of reach’. It’s also claimed that the club is interested inAberdeen’s 18-year-old right back Calvin Ramsay, who is also wanted by Leeds United, while a deal forFulham’s Fabio Carvalho, 19, has already been lined up. Liverpool’s desire to continue to improve the squad has been boosted by ‘positive noises’ from Jurgen Klopp over signing a new deal at the club. President of Fenway Sports Group (FSG), Mike Gordon, flew to Liverpool on Wednesday for the Reds’ Champions league semi-final clash with Villarreal with his ulterior motive to sit down with Klopp to discuss an extension. With Liverpool still on course to complete an unprecedented quadruple this season, FSG are understandably keen to tie Klopp – whom they have always seen as the perfect manager for the club – down to a new deal. The report claims ‘the strong bond Klopp has forged with Liverpool from an ownership, player and supporter perspective underpins his contentment’. But adds ‘afinal decision from Klopp on his future will also be heavily influenced by whether the assistant managers Pepijn Lijnders and Peter Krawietz are also on board, given the strength of his relationship with them’.

The Frenchman has also been linked with a move to Manchester United. It is said that Monaco’s asking price ‘could go up to £50m’. Following a spell at Bordeaux, Tchouameni made the move to Monaco during the winter transfer window in 2020. Aston Villa and Steven Gerrard are on the wrong trajectory together The 22-year-old has been an ever-present for Monaco over the past two seasons. He has been in fine form as he has played 47 times this term across all competitions. Tchouameni made his senior debut for France last year and he has now been capped eight times. Foot Mercato journalist Santi Aouna has revealed (via Twitter) that Liverpool are targeting Tchouameni. It is said that ‘contacts have been initiated’ between Liverpool and Monaco. In a boost to Liverpool, the player is reportedly ‘interested in the idea’ of playing in the Premier League. Meanwhile, Michael Owen has been taken aback by the recent performances of Divock Origi: “If you are in a rhythm, the easy bit is coming on and making an impact as a sub,” Owen said. “Everyone is tiring and it’s a free punch, that’s the easy bit. “The hard bit is the never playing bit. You get out of rhythm. Your mindset is not playing. “You go to bed on a Friday and you don’t even expect to play. “If you keep doing the right things, keep eating the right food, go to bed at the right time, and training perfectly. And you keep getting disappointed every weekend, then something switches off, at some point. “For him to stay at that level and that sharpness, and every single time he is called upon he comes on and makes a difference is quite staggering. “He doesn’t lose his fitness, his sharpness, he doesn’t lose anything, appetite and his attitude. “If I kept coming on and scoring, and being brushed aside and not starting and not playing, I’d start to get sickened by it. “So fair play to him, [he’s got] a great attitude.” ",positive,Liverpool,4

The Ajax boss has reportedly agreed terms in principle with United but is yet to be officially announced as their next permanent manager. Gossip: Manchester United linked with Premier League trio It is thought that confirmation of Ten Hag’s decision to swap the Eredivisie for the Premier League will come after the upcoming Dutch Cup final this weekend, which will see his side face PSV Eindhoven. With the 52-year-old’s arrival looking imminent, a number of stars have been linked with the club as they look to rebuild on what has been another disappointing season. United have made it five consecutive seasons without a trophy after a campaign of turmoil on and off the pitch and could miss out on qualification for the Champions League next season. Arsenal and Spurs are currently ahead of the Red Devils in the race for the top four. Whether the prospect of no Champions League football next season will affect who the club will target this summer, it remains to be seen. However, that wont stop a number of players from around the globe from being linked with a move to Manchester. ESPN are reporting that the latest name to be on the Man Utd shortlist is Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni. The Frenchman, who has already made eight appearances for the senior national side at the age of 22, has been in fine form in Ligue 1 this season. His performances have drawn attention from a number of top sides around Europe, including Liverpool, Chelsea and Juventus. The 22-year-old now appears to be on the shortlist for manager-to-be Ten Hag as he looks to improve what has been a troublesome position for a number of years at Old Trafford. This season Scott McTominay, Fred, Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba have all vied for a starting role in initially Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side and, more recently, under Ralf Rangnick. Tchouameni’s international teammates Pogba is out-of-contract in the summer and doesn’t look likely to agree a new deal whilst Matic, at 33, is hardly a long-term solution. Scotland international McTominay and Brazilian Fred have improved this season but if United are to take the next step and begin challenging for titles again, they will need reinforcements and Monaco’s Tchouameni could be brought in to do just that. It is also worth mentioning that Donny van de Beek, who is currently on loan at Everton, could feature more prominently next season after working under Ten Hag at Ajax. ",positive,Liverpool,1

But which one? Here are some of the arguments for and against five of the most often linked targets… Declan Rice For The England international has proved himself to be just the man United need to anchor their midfield. Rice initially carved out a reputation as a screener and this season has shown his credentials as a box-to-boxer. Rice has made more interceptions than anyone in the top flight and only Brentford’s Christian Norgaard has made more combined tackles and interceptions than the 23-year-old’s total of 147. There seems very little risk with Rice. United know exactly what they would be getting and that certainty usually comes at a premium. About that… Against United will have to break their transfer record and almost certainly the Premier League’s for most expensive signing if they want to get Rice out of West Ham. The player would almost certainly like to take the next step (assuming it’s not a lateral move between West Ham and United come the end of the season) and the Irons, under no pressure to offload with Rice under contract until 2025, could sell a huge deal to their fanbase. But that would require United to cough up in excess of £100million. Would they do that, especially if they aren’t in the Champions League next season? United might find themselves shopping with a tighter budget.   Kalvin Phillips For If United can’t get Rice, perhaps they might opt for his mate in England’s midfield. Phillips’ quality has been emphasised by how badly he’s been missed by Leeds during his recent injury-enforced absence. He’s not the only player Marcelo Bielsa and Jesse Marsch have been without, but Phillips seems like the biggest miss, especially given the way opponents have played through the Leeds midfield when he’s not manning the engine room. Even if Leeds appear to be on a firmer footing in the Premier League after two dramatic wins last week, the Whites’ finances could make them susceptible to offers on Phillips. Reports suggest he could go for £60million, which may be around half the price of Rice. Against A few clubs are said to be keen on Phillips, with Liverpool, Man City, Newcastle and Aston Villa all credited with an interest. Indeed, Villa are reported to be leading the race. If Phillips is ushered towards the door by Leeds while his hometown club seeks a windfall, then the 26-year-old will have to consider very carefully his next move if he wants to protect a legacy he’s cultivated at Elland Road as one of their own. Crossing the Pennines would tarnish that. Alan Smith made that move when Leeds were on the bones of their arse and they still haven’t really forgiven him in West Yorkshire. Indeed, it was reported last year that Phillips has already decided not to risk it. So United might be wise not to chase a lost cause. Of all those reportedly interested in Phillips this summer, I am told West Ham and Aston Villa are the only clubs to make enquiries so far. WHUFC remain interested following their January offers and AVFC CEO Purslow is a longtime admirer of Kalvin. As of now, no contact from MUFC — Jonathan Shrager (@JonathanShrager) March 22, 2022   Ryan Gravenberch For Gravenberch remains a teenager but has already amassed almost 100 appearances for Ajax and 10 caps for Holland. By the end of the season, he will have played almost four full senior campaigns before his 20th birthday. According to his former youth coach with the Amsterdam club, the deep-lying midfielder is “a better version of Paul Pogba” with the physique of Frank Rijkaard. Gravenberch’s career so far has been spent under the wing of Erik ten Hag. If United opt to name the Ajax coach as their new manager, then there would be sense in having him bring a player he knows better than anyone else can claim to. He would be half the price of Phillips and around a quarter of the cost Rice might be, which is important now. Against United’s last move for an Ajax midfielder was hardly a roaring success. Perhaps that is why Gravenberch is said to be lukewarm about the prospect of moving to Old Trafford, especially with Bayern Munich keen. Apparently, Gravenberch would prefer to hear first what the Bavarians have to say and the story goes that personal terms have already been agreed. All Bayern must do is find common ground with Ajax over a fee and their opening offer of £21million wasn’t too far from achieving its purpose. United may well be wasting their time putting Gravenberch at the top of their list of targets if he really is edging closer to Bayern. Where would you rather go right now?  Amadou Haidara For Ralf Rangnick certainly thought United would suit Haidara since he recommended that the club move on the Mali international in January. They decided not to because, well, United. The interim manager knows Haidara well from his time at RB Leipzig. It was Rangnick who took him to Germany from Salzburg and Haidara established himself as an important player for Julian Nagelsmann, Marsch and now Domenico Tedesco. Haidara can screen but Rangnick wanted him because of his ability to press further up the pitch. We assume United’s new coach will want to play a similar style to that which Rangnick has struggled to implement with the current squad and Haidara would certainly improve those prospects. In contrast to Gravenberch and Phillips, the prospect of playing for United arouses Haidara. “My dream club is Manchester United,” he said in 2019. Though plenty has happened since which may have prompted a rethink. Against Rangnick’s opinion presumably hasn’t been founded on Haidara’s stats. In the Bundesliga alone: 109 players have attempted more tackles; 195 have a higher tackle success rate than Haidara’s 22.6 per cent; 113 players have applied more pressures; and 27 have a higher pressure success rate. For comparison, Scott McTominay’s tackle success percentage is 49.2 per cent and Fred’s is 25.4 per cent, which is the worst in the United squad, but still better than Haidara’s.  Aurelien Tchouameni For United are just one of the clubs interested in Tchouameni. Apparently, so too are Chelsea, City and Liverpool. Plus other big hitters on the continent. But the 22-year-old reportedly has the Premier League in mind for when he leaves Monaco. Tchouameni was Ligue 1’s best young player last season and already has seven France caps to his name. So impressive has he been while standing in for N’Golo Kante, Pogba said: “We wish him to play a lot more games and that I am always by his side.” There is almost no chance of the pair teaming up at Old Trafford, butTchouameni could pick up a lot quicker the instructions of a new manager than Pogba and his team-mates have shown they are able or willing to over the years. “In his position, you need to be disciplined and organise others around you,” said then-Monaco coach Niko Kovac. “He is always trying to learn and understand. He absorbs all the information we give to him.” Tchouameni wouldn’t break the bank for United, with a reported asking price of £42million within the Red Devils’ budget this summer, even if they are tightening their belts. Against Technically and tactically, there is no reason United shouldn’t go forTchouameni this summer. He’s within budget, young but gathering experience quick and only getting better. But, of course, United are not the only club keen on the 22-year-old. Given how United hate losing face, will they really be prepared to go up against the likes of City and Liverpool when their rivals can offer Champions League football when they most likely cannot? That’s not to say they shouldn’t move decisively overTchouameni – just don’t expect them to.  ",positive,Liverpool,3

Tchouameni was named Ligue 1’s Young Player of the Year last season after a breakout campaign which saw him start all but two of Monaco’s league games. The 22-year-old’s accomplished displays as a deep-lying midfielder caught the eye of clubs such as Chelsea, Man Utd and Real Madrid, all of whom retained their interest going into the January transfer window. The financial insanity must stop; football needs recalibration A report last month insisted that Liverpoolare now ‘more interested’ in Tchouameni than AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessieas they look to boost their engine room in the summer transfer window. Over the weekend it was claimed thatLiverpool and Man United ‘have asked’ about the France international’s availability and Tchouameni ‘would not see the option [of a Premier League move] badly’. And now Spanish publication Marca (via Sport Witness) reckon that Liverpool are now ‘placed in the lead’ for Tchouameni along with rivals Manchester United and Manchester City. Meanwhile, Liverpool beat Nottingham Forest 1-0 on Sunday as they moved into the semi-finals of the FA Cup with Jurgen Klopp’s men excelling in all competitions. Diogo Jota’s 78th-minute goal secured a first win at Nottingham Forest’s City ground in 13 visits – succeeding where Arsenal and Leicester had failed this season – to book a Wembley date with Manchester City on April 16. Getting past Forest, in the first meeting between the two clubs in 23 years, proved difficult enough. Had Philip Zinckernagel not missed a one-on-one with goalkeeper Alisson Becker a couple of minutes before Jota struck the outcome could have been different. “It was the game we expected, especially if you don’t use your chances,” Klopp said. “We could have played better, but we should have scored in the first half. If we scored earlier it would be a completely different game. “All respect to Steve (Cooper) and Nottingham Forest, a top, top performance, really professional, really well organised. ““It was a brilliant atmosphere.

He has been the subject of a number of ‘juicy offers’ already with the 22-year-old ‘aiming for the Premier League’. Meanwhile, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp knows Andy Robertson is “desperate to deliver” as the left-back was landed with even greater responsibility in the wake of Trent Alexander-Arnold’s absence. With the Reds’ marauding right-back, who has provided two goals and a career-best 16 assists this season, sidelined for a number of weeks with a hamstring injury, the emphasis will switch heavily to the Scotland captain on the opposite flank. While he has not been as prolific as his counterpart he was man of the match in Wednesday’s defeat of Arsenal, setting up the important second goal for Roberto Firmino. “It is the full package of Robbo, not only as a player but a person as well. He wants desperately to deliver and work for the team,” said Klopp on Friday. “Even though he and Trent set up a lot of goals, there is still space for improvement in the decisive moments. “The goal (at Arsenal) was one of our favourite goals for a long time; first we win the ball back and second Robbo is waiting with his cross until he saw Bobby is now ready for it. “It was an incredible pass in the end and Bobby had to do a lot to get it past (Aaron) Ramsdale. “Yes played a really good game.

The winner has to come from the best team and the best team is often unknown until May. “All the awards should be left as late as possible and I always thought voting for the PFA Player of the Year was done far too early, often months before the season finishes. “It seemed strange timing to me, with so much of the league left to play, and I could never quite get my head around why voting was not electronic either. There should be an app for your phone that takes 10 seconds to complete.

The performances of Virgil van Dijk have been an absolute joke. Sadio Mane as well, coming back from winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal and picking up where he left off.

Clearly he has to be in there, given how electric he has been throughout the campaign, even allowing for him going off the boil slightly in recent weeks. “Those five names are my list and it has to be one of them.

Keane decided on a team of Peter Schmeichel; Gary Neville, Gary Pallister, Jaap Stam, Denis Irwin; David Beckham, Paul Ince, Bryan Robson, Ryan Giggs; Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo. And the Man Utd legend explained his decision to make Schmeichel the goalkeeper despite him not being “as good as everyone thought”. “I don’t like upsetting my team-mates,” Keane said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football. “I had to leave out some brilliant players, brilliant characters, but obviously I’ve done it. Edwin [Van der Sar] was nearly a sparring partner. “Goalkeepers get too much praise when they make a save. I had to go with Peter because he was very, very good – not as good as everyone thought, but very good. “And obviously, I have good memories with him. He was a good character in the dressing room – me and Peter certainly weren’t the best of mates, absolutely far from it, but the most important thing I had for Peter – and all of my team-mates – was huge respect. “He produced big moments and helped us get over the line in big matches, that’s the bottom line. Before you go into any match, you look over your shoulder at who’s in goal and you go, ‘yeah, I’m happy with him – we’ve got a chance.’ Peter would produce and help us get trophies.” Keane selected Stam and Pallister as his two centre-backs but he felt harsh leaving Ferdinand and Steve Bruce out of his XI. The former midfielder added: “Centre-back was probably the hardest one because Rio was excellent, Brucey was a good character. I just couldn’t leave Jaap Stam out. He didn’t play as many games as the other lads but he was big, strong, brave, brilliant at one-on-ones. “The other one was an issue but I’ve gone with Gary Pallister. I’d probably say [it was between Pallister and] Rio. Rio was obviously a good athlete and read the game well but my relationship with Pally was pretty good as well. “Did [Stam] have any real weaknesses? He could head it, he could leap, he could read the game, he was strong, aggressive, a decent lad. I got on really well with him.

Maybe he tarnished his United reputation; he ended up playing at Liverpool or wherever. When he was at United, there was all talk of Incey being the governor. “People kind of held that against him but that was just banter, there was no nastiness with that.

Jurgen Klopp’s side overcame Villarreal 2-0 in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final and are now huge favourites to make the final of Europe’s showcase competition for the third time in five seasons. F365 says: Liverpool sidestep another obstacle that could hand them boost for title as well as Europe The quadruple would be an unprecedented feat in England and both Ferdinand and fellow BT Sport pundit Michael Owen were in awe of the Reds on Wednesday. “This is the best Liverpool team I’ve ever seen,” Ferdinand said. “They’re relentless with and without the ball. It’s the way they press teams, the energy, effort, application, you marvel at it. “That [the quadruple] has got to be the aim.

The way they’re playing, the belief, you’re thinking can it happen?” Klopp said after his side’s victory that they “had a lot of good moments”. “It was a brilliant game. The first half I liked a lot – we didn’t score, that was the only problem that we had,” Klopp said. “But we kept them quiet, which was important because of the counter-attacking threat. “We tried to create, tried to be direct, mix it up, play through the lines. We had a lot of good moments, no goals, true, but I was really fine with the first half. “And then in the second half, obviously we finished the situations off. Both goals were outstanding. We wanted to score a third, but from a specific moment on it makes then sense that you control the game, and that is what we did. “It’s half-time, nothing else, but it’s better than before the game.” ",positive,Liverpool,3
https://www.football365.com/news/mediawatch-revealed-truth-ferdinand-quotes-thiago-liverpool?utm_source=Recirculation&utm_medium=WP_Related_Articles_Unit&utm_campaign=Benchmark,Revealed: The shocking truth behind those Ferdinand quotes about Liverpool midfielder Thiago,"Pep Guardiola’s future is a point of concern after a Champions League thriller, but those Rio Ferdinand quotes on Thiago are the big news. Increasingly stranger things Ian Ladyman of the Daily Mail understandably enjoyed himself at the Etihad but something was eating him up inside: ‘We are four years in to the second decade of Middle East ownership now and watching this incredible game of European football it was hard not to wonder what further fabulous dramas may lie ahead. ‘More particularly, it seemed increasingly strange – as City traded thunderous blows with the best team in Spain – to ponder why Pep Guardiola would even think about leaving when his current contract expires at the end of next season.’ That does seem an ‘increasingly strange’ angle to ‘ponder’ after ‘watching this incredible game of European football’, which is presumably why literally no-one else did. But here we are. Guardiola has a contract that runs until 2023. He has been at Manchester City since 2016. This is already his longest unbroken spell as manager of one club by two years. That tenure, a four-year reign at Barcelona, came to an end because of a self-confessed need to “recharge my batteries”. It is not difficult to figure out why Guardiola might leave when his deal expires. But again, why is this hypothetical scenario that might come to pass in 13 months’ timeeven a subject of discussion after the first leg of an enthralling Champions League semi-final? There is no answer. Only more instances of things seeming strange. ‘This is the City team that Guardiola built and much as they were brilliantly expansive and precocious here, it is one that will only grow better, wiser and more talented from this point. ‘Next season, for example, the Premier League leaders are expected to have the Norwegian forward Erling Haaland in their ranks. ‘So, yes, it seems strange that Guardiola would even think about leaving as he has previously suggested he will.’ It would be strange if Guardiola didn’t think about leaving when his current contract of employment runs out. It would be strange if Guardiola was even looking beyond May, considering this season could yet end with Manchester City winning no trophies or claiming a Premier and Champions League double. It is downright bizarre that this is such a point of focus. ‘For all its quirks, this has the look of the greatest City team Guardiola has assembled in his six years in England. Its rivalry with Liverpool is magnetic. ‘If Guardiola does not continue to work here beyond next season, it’s hard to wonder where he will go. Even harder to work out why.’ It truly is impossible to predict what a man who took a sabbatical after four years of intense and uninterrupted elite coaching could potentially do after seven years of intense and uninterrupted elite coaching. Hopefully by the end of that seventh year, Ladyman has figured out the ‘increasingly strange’ world of football contracts.  Pep talk ‘Pep Guardiola must be furious with narrow Man City win – Real Madrid are comeback kings’ – the Daily Mirror headline to John Cross’ opinion piece. ‘Pep Guardiola’s delight with Manchester City’s swashbuckling win against Real Madrid outweighed any frustration about their inability to put the Champions League semi-final to bed in a jaw-dropping first leg’ – MailOnline.  Spill the Thi The biggest story on Wednesday, of course, is not Manchester City beating Real Madrid 4-3 in a thriller. It’s that Rio Ferdinand has said some words about Thiago Alcantara. ‘Rio Ferdinand claims Thiago Alcantara told him he wanted to sign for Man United before joining Liverpool from Bayern Munich and says his ‘ridiculous’ form shows ‘players need time’… as he tips Jadon Sancho to emulate him,’ is the beefyMailOnline headline. They add with no little specificity that ‘Ferdinand reveals the player told him he was keen on becoming a Red Devil in 2020 when he was linked with a move away from the Bundesliga’. Except Ferdinand revealed no such thing. He was asked about Manchester United’s previous interest in the midfielder, said that he “spoke to him” and Thiago “wanted to come to United”. But this was in 2013. Not 2020, and definitely not ‘before joining Liverpool from Bayern Munich’. Ferdinand has even spoken about this at length before on this very same podcast. Still, if one outlet blinks then others must follow: ‘Rio Ferdinand claims Thiago Alcantara “wanted” to join Man Utd before Liverpool transfer’ – Daily Mirror website. ”I spoke to him’ – Rio Ferdinand makes Thiago transfer claim over Liverpool and Man United’ – Liverpool Echo, who echo the demonstrably erroneous claim that ‘the former England international has claimedThiagotold him he was keen on a move to Old Trafford in 2020’. ‘Rio Ferdinand claims Thiago Alcantara told him he wanted to make Man Utd transfer before moving to rivals Liverpool’ – The Sun website, who even quote Ferdinand as saying “I spoke to him at the time he joined” Liverpool to make it sound more current, when he said no such thing.  But credit where it’s due: Manchester Evening News say ‘Rio Ferdinand makes Thiago admission over Manchester United ‘interest’, yet they clarify that he is talking about a situation many years ago, instead of following everyone else in pretending Thiago rejected Manchester United in favour of Liverpool. Actual fair play.  Saint Etienne “Anfield is hell!” – Villarreal’s Etienne Capoue claims Liverpool have worst stadium’ …to play at as a visiting team, as the Daily Mirror website well knows.  Trophy strife The Liverpool Echo headline: ‘Liverpool trophy priority is clear as one cup stands out in quadruple quest’ The Liverpool Echo sub-headline: ‘All Liverpool fans will want the quadruple from here if possible – but is there one trophy that means more than the others?’ You would hope so, considering Liverpool’s ‘trophy priority is clear as one cup stands out in quadruple quest’. Yet of the two writers tasked with debating the point, Sean Bradbury argues the case for the Premier League and Richard Garnett is in favour of the Champions League.

The first leg takes place at Anfield on Wednesday night. Jurgen Klopp made three changes for this game. Matip, Naby Keita and Diogo Jota all dropped out. Ibrahima Konate, Jordan Henderson and Luis Diaz came into Liverpool’s starting eleven. The shocking truth behind those Ferdinand quotes about Liverpool midfielder Thiago Liverpool signed Matip in 2016 from Schalke. He is arguably enjoying his best season to date on a personal level. The 30-year-old has started 38 games across all competitions this term. Konate has featured less – starting 19 games – but he has impressed in his own right. Ferdinand thinks Matip has been one of the best defenders in the Premier League this season: “If I am Joel Matip, I am fuming. He has been exceptional all season and we talk about being the best defenders on form in the league, he would be in there for a shout after (Virgil) Van Dijk,” Ferdinand said (quotes via The Express). “So yeah set-pieces must be a big thing for his team selection this evening. I think the most impressive thing for me is the way [Klopp] has been able to utilise his squad. “Just shuffling the back at any given time, and those players are coming in and impacting the team. They are playing big roles in that, Konate is a good example for that, he has come in and scored goal after goal, and as a manager it is a dream scenario at the business end of the season.” Thousands of friends all round about you ❤ pic.twitter.com/ADmd4tj8m7 — Liverpool FC (@LFC) April 27, 2022 Michael Owen added: “It is a Champions League semi-final so of course you are going to play your best team, but I think Matip all season has been number one all season, but I think the goals that Konate has scored in the past few games, he does add something different.” Peter Crouch went onto suggest that Liverpool will be helped by Konate’s “dominance” in the air against Villarreal: “I think it is their strongest team, I think the only position you could argue is between Matip and Konate. “But he has brought in (Jordan) Henderson for (Naby) Keita, and (Luis) Diaz, for (Diogo) Jota and I think for me that is the strongest squad available. “The reason I think Konate has been brought in is for his dominance aerially at set pieces and he as proved to be dangerous at set-pieces in previous rounds and that can be an influence on these games.”  ",positive,Liverpool,6

Thiago was criticised last season for playing a part in the Reds poor that saw them in sixth place in the Premier League table at the beginning of April. They recovered to finish third in the end and they have had a great season this campaign with an amazing Quadruple still within their grasp. Revealed: The shocking truth behind those Ferdinand quotes about Liverpool midfielder Thiago Thiago produced an incredible performance as Liverpool beat Man Utd 4-0 eight days ago and has put in a number of high-level displays this term. When he joined Liverpool he was regarded as one of the best midfielders in world football and he is now living up to that tag this season. “Thiago has been the stand-out midfielder for the last few weeks and months he’s been absolutely top,” Ferdinand said on hisVibe With FiveYouTube channel. “You look at his stats. Thiago’s pass accuracy by the way in the last two games against Everton and Man Utd 98.4 percent against Everton and 95.6 percent against Everton. That is ridiculous. “I spoke to him at the time. He speaks perfect English, he was a great guy, wanted to come to United. But you look at him now and he couldn’t be happier.” A number of Man Utd signings, such as Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane, have not hit the ground running at Old Trafford and Ferdinand has urged his fellow Red Devils supporters to see Thiago as an example of players needing time to settle. “There were ex-players I saw saying ‘he’s side to side, doesn’t play the ball forward he isn’t ready-made for this league’. Players need time. “It goes back to this thing with managers and Man Utd as well the club need to give the manager at Man Utd patience, the clubs need and the fans need to give players that come in from other leagues especially patience. “Sancho is another example.

Son grabbed his second of the game and 19th of the season in style as he curled a 20-yard effort into the top corner to put the seal on Spurs’ victory. Spurs settle another set of jitters with a masterclass from Son Heung-min He had earlier set up Harry Kane’s opener from a corner and doubled the lead when he turned and shot on the hour mark. The quality of the goal left Conte wondering which was Son’s strongest foot, but the Italian said moments like that will only count for something if Spurs achieve their goal of finishing in the top six. “I gave him a big hug because after an amazing goal my question was which is his favourite foot, right or left?” Conte said. “He scored a fantastic goal and three minutes before when I spoke with him I said, ‘Go for five or six minutes and then I have to make a change’. “I said to him that when you listened that I wanted to make a change and you decide to score this amazing goal. “We are talking about a great player, fantastic player. But it’s important at the end of the season to celebrate a big achievement with the team. Otherwise it remains only a personal success only to score these types of goals.” OH SONNY YOU BEAUTY — Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) May 1, 2022 The victory saw Spurs get back on track in their quest for Champions League qualification after taking one point in their previous two games. Conte knew it was especially important to win as they visit title-chasing Liverpool next weekend. “It was a good performance against a really good team,” he said. “The game wasn’t easy and we knew very well that despite them making eight changes from the last game against Roma you can see the quality, you can see the squad that Leicester has. “I think then we deserved to win the game. “For sure we got three points in an important moment of the season, especially because in the next games we are going to face first Liverpool and then Arsenal. “Today it was vital to get three points. There is only one result and a lot of pressure, but I said to my players to live this moment, to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months. “I think no one at the start of the season could imagine Tottenham challenging for a place in the Champions League, especially in November when there was a change, and for this reason we have to be satisfied that we stay in this position to fight for a big achievement.” ",positive,Liverpool,2
https://www.football365.com/news/pochettino-better-manager-spurs-conte-opinion?utm_source=Recirculation&utm_medium=WP_Related_Articles_Unit&utm_campaign=Benchmark,Is Pochettino a better manager for Spurs than Conte?,"Making the emotional case from the heat for a Pochettino-Spurs reunion is easy. But what about from the head? It’s no great surprise that Mauricio Pochettino looks set to lose his job as PSG manager. Having failed to win the Champions League, not even romping home to the Ligue 1 title was ever going to save him. Even so, the speed with which the Parisiens have apparently set about binning him off is a brutal old business. It’s been a strange spell in Paris for Pochettino. It has, predictably, brought the trophies his CV lacked. It has, just as predictably, exposed the disingenuous nature of the previous arguments against his coaching talents because he hadn’t won trophies. Because it was never really about the trophies; it never is. It’s just using whatever stick is available to beat the target of your criticism. Had he won a Carabao or FA Cup with his magnificent Spurs side, the ‘no trophies’ argument would simply have become ‘only a Carabao’. Even winning the 2019 Champions League would simply have been memory-holed and written off as a freak occurrence. If that sounds implausible, just have a look at what Manchester United fans were saying when people started talking up the City-Liverpool rivalry as the Premier League’s greatest. ‘Only one Premier League title’ was the cudgel against Liverpool and Klopp. Anything can be written off if it’s inconvenient. Pochettino has done precisely as well as anyone could have realistically expected at PSG, but inevitably that has seen his stock fall. Anyone could win Ligue 1 with PSG, it’s meaningless, as long as you ignore the fact that Thomas Tuchel could not pull it off last season. And no manager has delivered the Champions League title they crave and it remains doubtful whether any manager can overcome the disadvantage that comes from trying to level up from a weaker domestic league to the teak-tough knockout stages. His reign in Paris has been flawed as it was always likely to be. His next job after Spurs always had to be one of the superclubs, but PSG always seemed the very worst fit despite his links to the club in its former guise as just a football club. Pochettino’s ethos is all about the collective – “you sign a contract to train, not to play” – and that was never a good fit for a club that is a branding and promotional tool first and football team second. The superstars will play, must play, and that’s that. His detractors use his flawed spell in Paris as evidence that there remains something second tier about him, that he isn’t quite up to the biggest jobs. Really all that we know is that he wasn’t right for this specific one of the biggest jobs. The criticism is unsurprising, but what is strange is that there also now seems to be some negative retrospective reappraisal of his time at Spurs, much of it coming from Spurs fans themselves. Nothing that has happened to either Spurs or Pochettino since his departure appears to support this view, but it’s definitely there. And that’s because, inevitably, the news of his imminent Paris exit sparks talk of a Spurs return. The timing is key here, because even a couple of weeks ago it would not have played out quite the same. When the Manchester United job was still available and Antonio Conte’s Spurs appeared to have struck gold by simply scoring four goals every week, the talk would have been more in the direction of United. But Erik Ten Hag is in at Manchester United, and Spurs have gone two moribund games without a shot on target against Brighton and Brentford. Conte is once again making eyes at the exit door and uncertainty has returned. Champions League football has also gone from ‘probable’ to ‘unlikely’. So would and should Spurs consider bringing Poch back? The case from the heart is easily made. There is without doubt unfinished business on both sides here, and Pochettino has made no secret of his desire to return to the club one day. The appeal of just running with the energia universal vibes and bringing him back, re-signing Christian Eriksen and re-swapping Bryan Gil for Erik Lamela should be obvious even to those dreary trophy-counters turned trophy-dismissers. But is there an argument to be made with the head? We’re saying yes. And it’s this. Antonio Conte is a better manager than Mauricio Pochettino, but is he a better Spurs manager at this moment? That’s less clear-cut.  The reports of his interest in the PSG job coming moments after news that Pochettino was likely on his way out are the key. His camp moved to brief against those reports, but the fact is that even if not true they are entirely believable and plausible. He is not a manager for the long haul at even the biggest clubs, and certainly not at Spurs. He has achieved a lot in a short space of time in the “painful rebuild” that was already overdue when Pochettino left Spurs in 2019 and became more and more urgent as Jose Mourinho huffed and sulked around the place for a year and a half. If he were a manager Spurs could realistically keep for five years, then everything Conte has done since November would be fine and dandy. From where he found them they had no business being in Champions League contention this season. If this was stage one of a proper new five-year plan they would be ahead of schedule. But with Conte, Spurs are always against the clock. His contract runs only to the end of next season and even that looks a long way away. The possible 12-month extension to that contract even more so. There is no escaping the sense that however things are currently going in what has been an up-and-down five months he has always had and will always have one eye on the exit door. Spurs will always be in this curious stalled position while Conte is manager. He’s not going to instantly turn them into top-level contenders again because nobody could, but any improvements he does make – and there have been plenty – are caveated into oblivion by the near-certain knowledge that he won’t be around to finish the job. Under Conte, Spurs are far better than they were without him, but it all feels oddly directionless. He is laying solid foundations for a palace that will never be built. Under Pochettino, Spurs would at the very least have the prospect of a manager who might still be around to finish what he started. And even if it did go horribly wrong, as the “never go back” truism and the fact this is Spurs suggest is quite likely, the closure that would provide – even if painful – is something both club and manager need to properly move on. It’s not as strong as the case from the heart, admittedly, but it’s there. There’s no denying an element of Tobias Funke “but it might work for us” to it all. Yet it’s hardly damp-eyed delusion to look at Conte and Pochettino and conclude that both men are probably better suited to the other’s job. And even then, wanting to stick with Conte is a perfectly viable position that it should be entirely possible for Spurs fans or anyone else to hold without having to denigrate what Pochettino achieved and could still offer. At the very, very least, Pochettino’s likely availability and keenness given the closing-off of alternative avenues offers the security of a better and cheaper back-up option than Spurs could realistically hope for should Conte’s wandering eye take him elsewhere.

https://www.football365.com/news/liverpool-seriously-interested-bringing-bowen-west-ham-premier-league-transfer,Liverpool are ‘seriously interested’ in bringing PL star to Anfield,"Liverpool are keen to bring West Ham forward Jarrod Bowen to Anfield in the summer transfer window, according to reports. The 25-year-old has made 31 starts this campaign and has found the back of the net 12 times whilst providing nine assists. He has been hotly tipped to receive an England call-up amid his terrific form, with the next international break taking place in late March. Liverpool have Salah situation wrong and Leeds fans want more Liverpool were rumoured to be interested in the Hammers man earlier in the season but now his form has only served to increase their desire to bring Bowen to Anfield in the summer. GiveMeSport transfer insider Dean Jones has claimed: ‘Maybe Jarrod Bowen is next on their radar and he’s somebody they’re seriously interested in.’ The Reds reinforced their forward line in January when they invested £37m on Luis Diaz, with the fee potentially reaching £49m if the winger triggers certain add-ons. Liverpool are trying to tie Mo Salah down to a new contract with the Egyptian’s deal expiring in the summer of 2023. There have been rumours that the Reds will attempt to bring the average age of their frontline down further and now Bowen could be their main summer target after he ‘caught the attention of Jurgen Klopp’s side’. Meanwhile, John Barnes doubts Bowen would ever be able to replace Salah but the former Liverpool midfielder doesn’t doubt the West Ham player’s class. “Jarrod Bowen is playing for a team that are in the top four or five in the Premier League, so he’s playing at the very top – as of right now,” Barnes toldBonusCodeBets. “He needs time to develop; he’s in his first real season playing for a better side. “Bowen’s never going to sign for Liverpool and replace Mohamed Salah. He is a different type of player to Mo, he isn’t going to score 30 goals a season, that’s not what Jarrod Bowen does. “In terms of his talent, can he play at big top five club? Absolutely.” Joe Cole was waxing lyrical about Bowen after their recent draw against Newcastle with the former West Ham midfielder claiming the 25-year-old is “getting better and better”. Cole said on BT Sport: “He’s unbelievable, every time I watch him I’ve been so impressed with him. He’s getting better and better and better. He’s movement is so good. He’s a lovely deliverer of set pieces as a well. He’s one of the most improved players in the league.” ",positive,Liverpool,6
https://www.football365.com/news/manchester-united-treble-liverpool-quadruple-mediawatch-stan-collymore,Who thinks the Manchester United Treble beats a Liverpool Quadruple?,"Stan Collymore, that’s who, though we think it’s largely because Stan Collymore was playing in 1999. Hit Quad Mediawatch had to check that Stan Collymore is actually only 51 after reading his latest ‘it were better in the olden days’ column in the Daily Mirror. His contention is that actually, Liverpool winning the Quadruple – literally never achieved before in football – would not be that impressive in the grand scheme of things. Of course, it would be a ‘fantastic achievement’ but ‘it won’t be any greater than Tottenham’s Double in 1960-61, Arsenal’s in 1970-71, or Liverpool’s in 1985-86’. We’re fascinated to hear how four trophies are actually no better than two, apart from ‘because it were better in the olden days’. We’re fascinated to hear how Arsenal’s 1970-71 side – who crashed out of the League Cup and Europe – are actually the equal of a team that wins all four trophies available at a time when they are up against the greatest club side of the last decade. We’re fascinated to hear how Liverpool’s 1985/86 side – barred from Europe but beaten by mid-table QPR in the League Cup –are actually the equal of a team that wins all four trophies available at a time when they are up against the greatest club side of the last decade. And then comes ‘Manchester United’s Treble in 1998-99 which, pound for pound, would still be the greatest achievement of all’. Why? Even the staunchest United fan would have to agree that four is a bigger number than three. United won the title with 79 points, a total surpassed by Liverpool and Manchester City this season with several games to spare. They also won the FA Cup and the Champions League but they lost in the third round of the League Cup. And yet that is still the better achievement than winning all four trophies? Because everything was better when Stan was playing? Collymore offers literally no explanation why United winning three trophies is better than Liverpool potentially winning four, other than a lack of ‘financial doping’, which kind of ignores two things: 1) United spent rather a lot of money to win those trophies and 2) The ‘financial doping’ of Manchester City, United and Chelsea in modern times makes it even more remarkable if Liverpool win four trophies. He then writes that when he played, ‘Matt Le Tissier spent his career with the Saints, but he’d have been taken on by one of the big boys after a couple of years these days’, to which we offer the words ‘Harry’ and ‘Kane’. We could also point out that Le Tissier turned down several moves away from Southampton but actually, we have already given that argument more credence than it deserves. ‘Spurs, Arsenal and Kenny Dalglish’s Liverpool all hit the heights with smaller squads than Jurgen Klopp’s Reds and City have at their disposal today’. They hit smaller heights with smaller squads at a time when all their rivals had smaller squads too; Spurs played 49 games to win their double and Liverpool have played 56 games already. You’re comparing apples with oranges and deciding that pineapples are better.  Done Ron Ron Ron ‘At least you can rely on Cristiano Ronaldo to lift the spirits,’ writes Neil Custis in The Sun. ‘A sparkling display, capped by his 24th goal of the season from the penalty spot, gave Manchester United fans something to cheer. In fact, he has probably given them the only things to cheer this season.’ Is this the same Ronaldo and indeed the same Neil Custis that collided to bring us these words in February? ‘The truth that is now staring everyone in the face, and clearly Ronaldo himself, is that his days as a top-class footballer are over. ‘It has been an admirable battle against father time but he is now losing it.’ ‘Losing it’ and yet now, less than three months later (and three months older for Ronaldo), ‘they need him still, even at 37, as they look to the future’. But, but, but… ‘The problem, though, is that when the ball is at his feet, or on his head, there is no magic any more, it has all gone.’ It’s almost like – and stop me if this is blowing your minds – Ronaldo had a blip in form at the same time as Manchester United were utterly atrocious and he is now neither completely finished nor the future for United. But why acknowledge middle ground when you can lurch wildly between extremes? Somebody give Custis one of those heated lavender packs to treat his whiplash.   Fergie timeHeadline on The Sun website as Ken Lawrence writes about – and we had to check this – a 3-0 victory: ‘Man Utd verdict: Final home game played against backdrop of depression and disillusion, it’s a far cry from Fergie days’ It’s been nine f***ing years; get over it. ‘For the last home match of the season came agains the backdrop of depression and disillusion at a club that under Sir Alex Ferguson ruled the Premier League and on a couple of occasions did so in Europe too. ‘This is a very different United to the one Fergie guided to 13 titles, two Champions League successes and so much more silver wear.’ ‘Silver wear’ has made us laugh at least (it’s the pick of about 427 mistakes, including a description of Ronaldo as a ‘waining star’ and a brief discussion of ‘parametres’), but the rest of this is utterly miserable. It is a ‘very different United’ but how many times can that be written? Thousands, it seems. Manchester United have not had a very good season, but a 3-0 win over Brentford gave Lawrence the chance to write about the farewell of Juan Mata or maybe the promise of Anthony Elanga. That he watched that victory and essentially wrote ‘this Manchester United is not as good as Fergie’s Manchester United’ says a great deal about tabloid journalism and its obsession with a past in which they were still relevant.  Do one, Ron, RonKen Lawrence on The Sun website: ‘Ronaldo does not fit those parametres no matter that he had a sparkle about him against Brentford in what was his best all – round performance in months. ‘And in those months there have been hints for months that without Champions League football next season he will head off. ‘He certainly won’t want to be involved in the Europa League or perish the thought, playing in Europe’s third tier Conference.’ Ken Lawrence on the back page of The Sun: ‘CRISTIANO RONALDO dropped his biggest hint yet that he wants to stay at Manchester United – after mouthing: I’m not finished.’ That all seems perfectly clear.  Down, down, deeper and downElsewhere in Stan Collymore land, he seems to think that Burnley’s survival absolutely would not reflect badly on the recently sacked Sean Dyche, in fact ‘the opposite because every player at Turf Moor is a Dyche player’, and yet Leeds’ relegation would be down to ‘the over-egging of the Marcelo Bielsa pudding’. Now try and hold both of those opinions at the same time without getting a throbbing headache.  ",positive,Liverpool,8

The Dutchman was confirmed as the new permanent Red Devils boss last month with interim manager Ralf Rangnick making way at the end of the season. Man Utd beat Brentford 3-0 on Monday night to move six points ahead of seventh-placed West Ham – who have a game in hand on Rangnick’s men – but it’s unlikely that that the Red Devils will now finish higher than sixth position. Manchester United are shuffling their pack, but can lost leopards change their spots? Ten Hag has a huge job on his hands to get Man Utd competing for Premier League titles again and Neville has set out his timeline of expectations for the Dutchman. Neville said on Sky Sports: “I said four to five years to win a title and I don’t disagree with Jamie’s timeline of Champions League in the first two seasons while he’s sorting the recruitment out and getting used to the club. “Third season getting very close, I think to the point whereby the club have got confidence and won a trophy maybe. “And then that fourth year really is where they have to win a title, fifth year. That’s where I think really you’re looking at the moment realistically. “We all hope he comes in and blows everyone away and that Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola blow up somehow. “But they’re not blowing up are they? They’re achieving the same numbers of points year in year out so if their consistency remains, which there’s no reason to say it won’t then Ten Hag’s got a massive job to make up that points gap.” Year 1-2 | #UCL qualification Year 3 | Title challengers Year 4-5 | Premier League Winners 🏆 Gary Neville lays out the timeline that he expects Erik ten Hag to achieve things at Manchester United. pic.twitter.com/yd4KtSvhgc — Football Daily (@footballdaily) May 2, 2022 Fellow pundit Roy Keane thinks the main thing Man Utd need to improve on is their recruitment with a lack of the right characters in the Old Trafford dressing room. “Whatever their problems, they have to look at where Man City are, where Liverpool are,” Keane added. “Man City, Liverpool and these other teams aren’t going to take it easy over the summer. They’re going to reinvest, get players in and get stronger. “Klopp might stay on, Pep might stay on.

The biggest frustration for me, when they’ve had these disappointments, is the reaction they’ve shown. There’s been a real lack of leadership, not enough characters in that dressing room.”  ",positive,Liverpool,2

Ronaldo has scored 23 goals in 36 appearances in all competitions this campaign after joining from Serie A side Juventus in the summer transfer window. There have been rumours over the last few months that the Portugal international could ask to leave at the end of the season if Man Utd fail to qualify for the Champions League. Manchester United scout watches £100m target subbed at HT; Everton’s Richarlison hope It would take a minor miracle for the Red Devils to finish fourth this season and, with questions over whether Ten Hag will want to keep Ronaldo next term, the striker’s future is up in the air. When asked if Ronaldo would fit into Ten Hag’s plans, Rangnick told Sky Sports: “This is a question you need to askErik ten Hag. “He’s showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it’s obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, it’s pretty obvious.” CR7 in front of the Stretford End 🎯 👏 @Cristiano #MUFC | #MUNCHE pic.twitter.com/Qrnd0G1hKx — Manchester United (@ManUtd) April 28, 2022 On summer recruitment, he added: “If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window. “They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks. “This shows it is possible that this can happen and it would not necessarily need three, four years in order to do that.” On the appointment of Ten Hag, Rangnick continued: “Knowing Erik will be the manager, with a good recruitment process and bringing in the right players, I’m very positive the supporters and the media will be able to see a better team and, at the end, hopefully a better position in the league. “There are quite a few good examples in the league with when Jurgen Klopp came to Liverpool, Pep Guardiola to Manchester City, Thomas Tuchel came to Chelsea – yes, he came in the middle of the season and inherited a top-quality squad, but you still need to win the Champions League. “If you know what you’re looking for, the profiles of the different positions you need, it shouldn’t hopefully take too long.”  ",positive,Liverpool,2

WARD-PROWSE TO MANCHESTER Free-kick whizz-kid James Ward-Prowse has caught the attention of both Manchester United and Manchester City, who are reportedly interested in luring him away from St Mary’s this summer. United want to land two new central midfielders as part of a summer overhaul under new manager Erik ten Hag, and Ward-Prowse is among those on the club’s wishlist, according to the Daily Star. And it’s claimed the Red Devils will face direct competition with rivals Manchester City, as Pep Guardiola is a ‘huge admirer’ of the England international. The City boss described the 27-year-old – who has scored from four free-kick’s this season – as the best dead-ball specialist in world football and has been impressed by his box-to-box displays and incredible fitness record. Newcastle, Tottenham and Arsenal are also ‘tracking developments closely, while Aston Villa failed with a £25m bid for the midfielder last summer. The report concedes that Ward-Prowse is settled at Southampton but may decide to switch to a club playing European football to improve his chances of going to the World Cup in Qatar. It’s thought he would cost up to £60m.  MOUNTING CONCERN Chelsea are a bit concerned Mason Mount could be tempted to leave the club for Liverpool or Manchester City, who could take advantage of the club’s ownership crisis. It looks as though what the proces to replace Roman Abramovich is nearing its end, though it’s felt that way for a while. Despite Jim Ratcliffe throwing a lot of late cash in an attempt to buy the club, it appears Todd Boehly’s consortium are on the verge of tying up the deal. But for now, Chelsea are unable to offer their players new contracts. Mount, despite his importance to the club, is currently one of the lowest paid players in Thomas Tuchel’s squad, on around £70,000 per week. He has two years left on his current deal, but The Sun claim ‘concerns are growing’ that he could be tempted away by a more lucrative contract, with both Jurgen Klopp and Pep Gurdiola ‘major fans’ of the 23-year-old. Chelsea apparently planned to open talks of a long-term deal before Abramovich was hit by the sanctions, but they will have to bide their time with the future of the club still up in the air.  BUMPER JAMES DEAL Offering Mount a new deal should undoubtedly be a priority when the new owners are in place, and among the other players the club are desperate to keep is Reece James. 90min claim Chelsea have made the right-back’s future a priority as they look to ward off interest from Real Madrid. James has become a key member of Tuchel’s side in the last 18 months, registering five goals and six assists from wing-back this term, and the club is ready to offer him a ‘new bumper deal’ as reward for his fine performances.

Having been frustrated in the first half, Jurgen Klopp’s side scored two quick goals within ten minutes of the restart to hand them a healthy advantage heading into the second leg. F365 says: Liverpool sidestep another obstacle that could hand them boost for title as well as Europe Henry believes the Reds “weren’t showing a lot” beforePervis Estupinan got in the way of a Jordan Henderson cross and deflected the ball into his own net. “If you look at the game, I think a lucky goal bailed them out, for me,” said Henry. “I think they would have knocked on the door, if not all night. “It’s a lucky goal, the own goal of Villarreal is a lucky goal and I think, before that, they weren’t showing a lot. “But, along the way, I would say, when you are going for the quadruple, then you need to have that luck. And, after that, there is nothing about luck.” Meanwhile, the BT Sport pundits believe the tie is still just about alive. “Villarreal have just got a pulse,” Owen said. “If Liverpool nicked another one it would have been game, set and match.” “I think three would have killed it, that would have been too much for Villarreal to come back from,” Peter Crouch echoed. “Two is a possibility but it’s a slim, slim chance when you watch Liverpool in the form they’re in at the moment.” And Owen believes Klopp made a mistake in bringing Joe Gomez on for Trent Alexander-Arnold with then minutes to play as he felt Liverpool should have gone for the jugular. “I thought he made substitutions that almost didn’t promote going for an extra goal,” Owen said. “Joe Gomez for Trent for starters is much more defensive when your right-back is one of the most attacking players you’ve got on the pitch. “I thought maybe not that he was settling for two, but I thought he was comfortable and rested a couple of legs. “They’re going to have to go out there knowing that the game is still alive. It’s still got something in it. If they concede the first goal, it’s really alive. An extra goal tonight would have put it to bed.” ",positive,Liverpool,5

Quad-chasing Liverpool inevitably top Winners and Losers… He joined Arsenal for £27m from Saint-Etienne in 2019 and is yet to make a first-team appearance for the Premier League club. Saliba earned his first France cap last month and his parent club have reportedly been very happy with his progress in Ligue 1 this term.

If I make it into France’s squad it’s thanks to Marseille, because there is a lot of visibility. “They are a very big club with a lot of pressure, but when you’re good there are a lot of good things that happen to you. “We will see in May or June depending on the discussions. Today, my future, I don’t know what it is.” Marseille will not be short of competition if they are to fight for Saliba’s signature.

It was reported last month that Arsenal are among the Premier League teams interested in Gakpo. He is valued at around€40m by PSV. Liverpool ‘chaos’; Spurs awarded Arsenal’s transfer trophy The 22-year-old has been in fantastic form for the Dutch side this season. He has grabbed nine goals and 13 assists in the league from his 21 games. Gakpo made his senior debut for the Netherlands last year and he has now been capped four times. The winger is expected to leave PSV this summer. He has revealed that he wants to play in the Premier League: “The Premier League is a big league. Virgil van Dijk plays there with Liverpool so I like to watch them,” Gakpo told The Sun. “We are not the same kind of league but I think we try to look at the Premier League and learn about it. Everybody wants to play one time in the Premier League. I don’t favour one team but I like Arsenal a lot. “I looked up to Henry when I was younger because he was a tall guy who played on the wing.” Elsewhere,Unai Emery says “noise” is the big difference between managing Villarreal and his previous clubs, Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain. “The budget is important to have the best players but there are things that you can overcome with hard work. You have to create something else as a team, create a mentality and look for the details in the preparation. “Against a team that is normally better, we will be dominated for seventy or eighty minutes but there will remain 15 or 20% of the match during which you will have chances and that is what we will work on. “I impose the same demands on myself here as in Seville, at PSG or Arsenal. What changes here is that there is less ‘noise’ outside! At the same time, the noise, if you go out, you will hear it. “If you don’t go out, you don’t hear it. In the clubs where I worked and where there was a lot of noise, I always tried to keep the door closed.” ",positive,Liverpool,2
https://www.football365.com/news/decision-time-one-loanee-dilemma-saliba-van-de-beek?utm_source=Recirculation&utm_medium=WP_Related_Articles_Unit&utm_campaign=Benchmark,Decision time: One loanee per club sparking a dilemma,"A genuinely interminable international break plus a France debut for William Saliba was all the encouragement we needed to embark on a quest to identify one player per Premier League club currently out on loan who, for better or worse, has given his parent club a decision to make… Arsenal: William Saliba The Gunners have a whole gaggle of assorted players out on loan, and, despite the intriguing existence of Folarin Balogun as a striker whose Arsenal contract isn’t about to expire, the most interesting loanee is once again William Saliba. He was here last year and if anything the intrigue has only grown. He has now had three hugely successful years as an Arsenal player; he just hasn’t spent any of them at Arsenal. Loans at St Etienne, Nice and now Marseille have even earned him his first caps for France. Friendly caps might not seem all that big a deal, but winning a cap for France as a centre-back is just about the toughest task in the entire sport; Aymeric Laporte found it so difficult he had to become Spanish instead; Ibrahima Konate still hasn’t managed it. Saliba, the man apparently surplus to requirements at Arsenal, has done it. He is understandably happy and settled at Marseille, where he plays every game, and a return to Arsenal would mean fighting for a place with Gabriel and Ben White. A lot depends on the player, but with only two years left on the five-year contract Saliba signed as a teenager, Arsenal are now very much at the point where it’s time to sh*t or get off the pot.  Aston Villa: Matt Targett One of many players currently on loan – along with Keinan Davis, Trezeguet, Anwar El Ghazi and Frederic Guilbert – who Villa are seemingly happy to move on permanently in the summer. Targett is key, because it appears relatively straightforward to do a deal with Newcastle that suits all parties while also bringing in a reasonably sizeable transfer fee – something in the order of £15m has been mooted – to help bankroll Steven Gerrard’s ambitious summer masterplan of spending £60m on Kalvin Phillips.  Brentford: Marcus Forss The Finland striker was in the squad for every one of Brentford’s first 23 Premier League games. But he started just one of those, getting off the bench in just six others and never for more than 30-odd minutes. He scored no goals. He went back to the Championship on loan with Hull in January and has managed just a single goal in eight appearances for the Tigers. He’s still got four years left on his Brentford contract; it’s hard to see how he can be part of what will almost certainly again be a Premier League squad next year, but you can also see why he’d be reluctant to leave the security of that long-term contract. Another loan?  Brighton: Kjell Scherpen The Seagulls have 13 players out on loan like some kind of petrodollar superclub. At least one of these will definitely be in the squad next season, surely – striker Deniz Undav who has scored only one league goal fewer for shock Belgian league title contenders Union Saint Gilloise before and after a January sale-and-return move than his new Brighton team-mates have managed to put together in the Premier League. A more interesting one might be giant back-up keeper Scherpen, who might have been doing a more important off-field role in the first half of the season than many realised. Scherpen spent the first half of the season watching Robert Sanchez be very good indeed and is now on loan while Sanchez makes repeated bollocks of things as Brighton’s season threatens to end with the sort of whimper that can have alarming knock-on effects the following year if not addressed. Even if he doesn’t play a single game, Scherpen might be worth keeping around the place.  Burnley: Bailey Peacock-Farrell We’re not spoiled for choice here. It’s a third-choice goalkeeper or a fourth-choice goalkeeper. Let’s go with Peacock-Farrell who is doing a decent enough job in nets for fallen giants Sheffield Wednesday as they look to clamber out of League One. Our main observation is that it doesn’t matter how many games of football he plays or at what level. No matter how high his career goes we will never, ever, ever accept that Bailey Peacock-Farrell is not in fact the name of a rugby player who, after six successful years in Super League, crosses codes to join Bath or whatever and make eight appearances for England in the 15-man game.  Chelsea: Conor Gallagher There is not a single Chelsea player currently on loan at Vitesse, which is perhaps why the whole world currently seems to be desperately trying to spin itself off its axis. It’s just not right or normal, is it? Chelsea do, though, have about a million players out on loan as is customary. Now the whole global unpleasantness is of particular relevance to Chelsea, who may not in fact have any choice to make over who stays or goes or heads out on loan. They may not even exist next season. Probably they will, though. And probably they will get to decide these things. Which means a decision to make on Gallagher, who has been one of the most exciting and enjoyable players in the Premier League this season. We’re big fans of players who get to that level and still seem to visibly enjoy playing the game. Palace would, clearly, dearly love to keep him and you do get a keen sense that this is now someone who needs to be playing regularly. You can’t keep him on the bench, released only for the odd runaround in a Carabao or non-vital European game. He’s tasted regular top-level football now and found it entirely to his liking. At the very least, you’d think he needs to spend another year on loan playing all the football.  Crystal Palace: Luke Plange Palace only have two players currently out on loan and it’s fair to say their summer thoughts might be rather more exercised by what happens next to the player they currently have on loan (see above). Anyway, the two options are a) 23-year-old American Jacob Montes who has spent the entirety of his slightly odd one-year Palace contract pulling up no trees in a pair of half-season loans in the Belgian second division and therefore b) Luke Plange, the teenager whose breakthrough at Derby convinced Palace to make a buy-and-return move in January. Palace have a bit of form for developing Football League talent into Premier League players, but you’d imagine that’s probably a way off yet. A good Championship loan seems the likeliest option next season.  Everton: Moise Kean In theory, he’s still in the first year of a two-year loan at Juventus with an obligation to buy at the end of it. In theory. In reality, Juventus weren’t right sure a while ago and since signing Dusan Vlahovic are less convinced still about the merits of Kean who has scored just four goals in 24 Serie A games this season. All the noise suggests Juventus are looking to get out of the current arrangement and send Kean back to Goodison this summer, an outcome that we have to imagine absolutely nobody else involved wants. So whatever happens next it should be fun to see what comes of it all.  Leeds: Helder Costa In and out of the side at Valencia but has made no secret of the fact he’s happier in Spain and would like to make his move permanent if everyone else is up for it. They probably will be. “I feel better here, I came from a not so good situation (at Leeds). But Valencia have given me the opportunity to relaunch my career and I think this is the ideal place to do that,” Costa toldSuper Sport last year.   Leicester City: Dennis Praet A victim of the Dreaded Metatarsal, which has kept him out of the Torino side for a couple of months at a frustrating time and appears likely now to be a season-ender. The Belgian is apparently happy in Turin and keen to stay, but the Italian side seem keen to use his injury as a means to drive down the agreed £12.5m option price in the current loan arrangement. Reports from the Italian end suggest Torino might favour another loan over an outright purchase but, with just two year left on his Leicester contract, you’d imagine the Foxes would want something more concrete built into that. An obligation that kicks in once a set number of appearances is reached or some such thing. We don’t know. We’re not contract negotiators.  Liverpool: Nathaniel Phillips It’s between Phillips and Neco Williams here. Both will still have three years left on their contracts in the summer. Both are on loan at high-flying Championship clubs. Both have obvious talent. Both face significant top-quality barriers to their first-team progression at Anfield. But it’s Phillips, five years Williams’ senior, for whom the clock is more conspicuously ticking. Phillips did an admirable job in that desperate half-season for Liverpool last year when all their other centre-backs fell over, but is that situation going to present itself again? Should Bournemouth confirm promotion back to the Premier League, and that appears almost certain now given their sizeable cushion in both points and games in hand over third-placed Luton, you’d imagine both player and club might be keen on a more permanent arrangement. Ticklish thing there is that longish contract, half a season of decent Premier League football behind him and apparent absence of any option in his loan contract. What would Liverpool want for him? £15m is a number that has been touted, and if anything you’d be surprised if it was that low really.  Manchester City: Pedro Porro Just the 13 City players currently plying their trade elsewhere at the mo. Spain right-back Porro is perhaps the most interesting of those, currently in the second half of a successful two-year stint in Lisbon with Sporting that has already brought one league title and could yet bring another if a six-point gap to Porto can be overturned. Eight goals and nine assists from 65 games played predominantly at right wing-back are eye-catching numbers.  Manchester United: Donny van de Beek The arrival of a new manager in the summer means all things are a bit up in the air for United’s current loanees, who could suddenly find themselves far more in favour when a new man arrives. We suspect minds have been made up now, though, about Anthony Martial. Van de Beek is an intriguing one, though. Especially if United’s new manager does turn out to be his former Ajax gaffer Erik Ten Hag in spite of Louis van Gaal’s mischief-making. Van de Beek is clearly a talent, but whether he can crack it here remains in some doubt. What is not is that he is yet to be presented with an environment to categorically prove it one way or the other. In hindsight – and, if we’re honest, foresight – packing him off to Frank Lampard’s Everton Circus might not have been a brilliant idea. We’re still really none the wiser about him.  Newcastle: Freddie Woodman If you were loaned out by Newcastle in January then really it’s a pretty clear hint about where your future lies. For Woodman, who played four Premier League games at the start of the season, it’s meant sitting on the bench for promotion-chasing Bournemouth as back-up to Mark Travers. It is the seventh loan of his Newcastle career, and he has one year left on his contract at St James’ Park. At 25, it’s surely time for a permanent move to go and be first choice somewhere even if it means dropping down a tier or two.  Norwich: Todd Cantwell Like Norwich themselves, he’s pretty good at getting into the Premier League but not so good at staying there. With his current loan club Bournemouth set to once again swap divisions with parent club Norwich, the logical conclusion is surely for Cantwell to go back to Norwich and complete what would be the genuinely novel achievement of a third successive promotion from the Championship. Bournemouth do, though, hold the option of making the move permanent and spoiling everything.  Southampton: Dan N’Lundulu Because there is literally nobody else other than a 23-year-old striker who scored two goals in 20 League One appearances across a pair of loans at first Lincoln and then Cheltenham before suffering a season-ending hamstring injury.  Tottenham: Bryan Gil Spurs have seven players out on loan, and with most of them the future looks pretty clear one way or the other. It would be a major surprise were Tanguy Ndombele or Giovani Lo Celso to have futures in north London, which is a shame but also probably for the best. Neither has been missed since January. Jack Clarke was Spurs’ attempt at a moneyball signing and it’s not worked out. Cameron Carter-Vickers is likely to make his loan move to Celtic permanent. Pape Sarr, the teenage midfield sensation bought from and loaned straight back to Metz last summer, will require a decision but not a final one. The suspicion there is that he’ll spend pre-season with Spurs before either being brought into the first-team squad or sent on another loan. Spurs, you’d imagine, would prefer that to be to either a bottom-half Premier League club or ambitious Championship side (let’s face it, it will probably be Norwich) to find out how he goes in English football. But the big decision probably regards Bryan Gil, the skilful yet painfully lightweight Spanish winger who just looked nowhere near the right sort of fit for English football. His current loan in Spain cannot tell us much but he is the one player on the Spurs list where all things are possible. This time next year he could just as easily be a Spurs first-team regular, starring for Valencia in La Liga having joined on a permanent basis, doing bits for Crystal Palace on loan or languishing at Tottenham having subsisted on the occasional Europa night which is no longer an option because Spurs have found some new and absurdly Spursy way to get knocked out. Watford: Philip Zinckernagel The Hornets look to be on to a good thing whatever happens here thanks to Zinckernagel’s Nottingham Forest exploits. He’s scored five goals and laid on nine assists to help Forest into the play-off picture, but it’s his eye-catching displays in Forest’s fabulous FA Cup run that really make you take notice. If Watford stay up, then he has shown he can play at Premier League level. If they go down, then he has shown he can propel a Championship promotion bid. And if Watford go down and Forest go up, then they might be able to sell him for a nice price. Win, win, win. If you ignore the whole ‘relegation’ stuff, which is not a win and frankly a bit of a downer.  West Ham: Conor Coventry Because he’s the only West Ham player currently out on loan. They really don’t have a very big squad. The 22-year-old spent the first half of this season in the lower reaches of the Championship, making 12 appearances – mainly off the bench – for Peterborough, and is now in League One with MK Dons. Has just a year left on his contract at West Ham, for whom he has made three brief appearances off the bench in the League Cup.  Wolves: Adama Traore All appeared sorted when he set off to Barcelona initially on loan with a £29m option to make it permanent in the summer. Four assists in 10 games have gone some way to confirming the suspicion that his end-product stats might improve away from Wolves but there is yet a fly in the ointment thanks to Barcelona’s much-publicised financial problems making that £29m a bit steep for them. Wolves have made it clear that Traore is done at Molineux unless there’s a surprise U-turn on a new contract and even then Wolves may feel he’s burned his bridges. Spurs were keen in January, but might have moved on now. Could get tricky, this. ",positive,Liverpool,3

An own goal from James Tarkowski had the Clarets 1-0 down at Vicarage Road on Saturday before late goals from Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill turned the game on its head.

Keane said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football: “Big win obviously to come from a goal down, you see the reaction there. Obviously I don’t mind the manager celebrating but when I see everyone hugging and kissing I think it’s just slightly over the top.” Presenter Dave Jones interjected: “These are big results at stake aren’t they?” Keane continued: “I know, I know. But there has been all season. I think Dyche would’ve got the same results I really do but, listen, the decision is made now but there’s been a good reaction.” Jones then touched on Burnley’s good form and asked Jamie Carragher if that trend is continuing, to which the former Liverpool defender replied: “Yeah, I mean, I think Roy is right, we said that last week. Sometimes a different voice, maybe a slight change, you think of the impact it has maybe had on Dwight McNeil. “He did a great job, Sean Dyche, but it’s something a little bit different. If you just look at the numbers, and of course we’re only talking about four games, so that can be skewed because that’s such a great start. “But when you see the points and the goals, there’s obviously a huge uplift there because they’ve had such a great start. But I think the thing you look at when you go down is goals conceded as well and that’s something you always looked at with Sean Dyche’s team. “I see everyone hugging and kissing – I think it’s slightly over the top” 😤 Roy Keane was NOT happy with these Burnley celebrations ❌ pic.twitter.com/dH1Zhksa7E — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 2, 2022 “But, as I said, it’s only four games.

Meanwhile, Ralf Rangnick could return to Leipzig for a midfielder… LIVERPOOL KEEN ON CRANKY CAMAVINGA Eduardo Camavinga only joined Real Madrid in the summer, when Manchester United were thought to be interested in the France midfielder. But having struggled to secure a place in Carlo Ancelotti’s first XI, there is already talk of the teenager looking for another move. Camavinga has managed only six starts in all competitions for Real this season, which has prompted El Nacional to link him to Liverpool. Apparently, the 19-year-old ‘has a monumental rage’ over his situation at Real and is open to loan or permanent offers, and Jurgen Klopp is still keen to take the former Rennes star. Having done a deal to sign Camavinga in the summer which could cost them up to £35million, Real are said to want a profit on the midfielder.

There are no negotiations with other clubs over a possible January sale, while Pogba is still said to be assessing his options. Indeed, the Mirror reports that if Pogba wants to leave United next month, he will have to push for a move. But Ralf Rangnick is still exploring the market for midfielders and the Mirror reckons the United boss could make contact with former club RB Leipzig to discuss a deal for Amadou Haidara.

De Vrij is entering the final 18 months of his contract at the San Siro, where he played for Conte before the manager moved on. The Sun rehashes a report from Swiss website 4-4-2.com that suggests Spurs are keen on Matthijs De Ligt – but they won’t pay the ridiculous release clause that comes into play next summer. De Ligt could leave Juventus for around £130million at the end of the season, with Barcelona and Chelsea interested. But those clubs too would also be looking to negotiate on that figure.

The 25-year-old made the move to Liverpool in January from Porto for a fee that could rise to £50m. Tottenham Hotspur were pursuing him but he opted to sign for Jurgen Klopp’s side. Top ten players recently found down the back of the Premier League sofa who are thriving Diaz has hit the ground running for the Premier League outfit. He has grabbed four goals and three assists from his 20 outings. The forward was involved in two of Liverpool’s goals as they beat Man Utd 4-0 at Anfield last month. Ferdinand believes Diaz is vying to be one of Liverpool’s first-choice forwards: “Luis Diaz, the impact he’s had at Liverpool, and especially in the front areas,” Ferdinand said on his Five podcast. “We were saying before he came, ‘if one or two of them get injured up front, they’re going to be losing, the quality drops down dramatically’. When he starts, he’s probably vying now to be in the first three. “Like, Firmino would struggle to get in there, he [Diaz] probably gets in ahead of Jota now if they’re putting their best team in a Champions League final. That’s how much of an impact he’s made since he’s come. He has just been a breath of fresh air. You watch him play, on the ball he’s brilliant … but his reaction when they lose the ball is unreal. “He’s like a trigger, bang, go go and get it back. For those reasons, he’s the standout signing of the season for me.” Meanwhile,Peter Crouch thinks it’s between Liverpool forward Mo Salah and Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden for the PFA Player of the Year award: “This year, if Manchester City win the Premier League and Champions League, you would have to pick Phil Foden or Kevin De Bruyne. I’d potentially go for Foden because he has consistently been a shining light for them. “There are plenty of others you could choose and the same goes for Liverpool. The performances of Virgil van Dijk have been an absolute joke. Sadio Mane as well, coming back from winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal and picking up where he left off. He has to be in the conversation. “I do seem to be skirting around the fact that Mo Salah — already crowned FWA Footballer of the Year — has the most goals and assists this season.” ",positive,Liverpool,7

It was confirmed late last week that he would take over as Austria boss at the end of the season but remain at Old Trafford in a part-time role. There has always been an understanding that Rangnick would move into a consultancy position at Man Utd after his period as interim manager came to an end – but there was no expectation from fans that he would be doing another job at the same time. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong On becoming Austria boss, Rangnick said: “I will take over as national team manager of Austria at the end of the season but will continue my consultancy with Manchester United. “I’m really looking forward to playing my part in helping United become a real force again.” But Carragher thinks it is “a nonsense” that Man Utd think he will be able to fulfill his job at Old Trafford while also managing a national team. The former Liverpool defender said on Sky Sports: “Ralf Rangnick isn’t really a manager, he’s a director of football, he’s someone who helps the coaches or builds the club. “I’ll be honest with you I just don’t get that. I don’t think you can be manager of Austria and work for Manchester United. “He can work for Manchester United in that role…well that’s wrong. That should not be happening. “The manager of Austria should not be working part time for Manchester United. That’s just a nonsense! It’s one or the other.” 🗣 @Carra23: “That is WRONG. The manager of Austria should not be working part-time for Man Utd… that is a NONSENSE” 😡 pic.twitter.com/Pqk3lUndWL — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 2, 2022 Carragher hasn’t been the only pundit to be critical of the idea with former Man Utd defender Gary Neville insisting there will be a “conflict” between the two jobs. Neville told Sky Sports: “The Austrian national team has pride, great country and some great players so he’ll have to watch players all week then he’s going to go and coach them for two weeks in September, October, November and March. So you’re saying to yourself what’s happening with the Manchester United consultancy advice? “Where is the priority? There’s a conflict there.” Neville added: “I don’t see that. I don’t see how that can work, you’re a national team manager and I’ve worked under a national team manager, that national team manager has got to present week in, week out, Saturday, Wednesday, Saturday, Tuesday and he can’t be here at Old Trafford every week watching an Austrian player play. “I can’t see how that’s going to work, if it’s something that’s true. Maybe (it’s a compromise) but it’s messy, Manchester United can’t afford at this moment to have distractions, can’t afford at this moment in time to have a poor communications plan around the idea that Ralf Rangnick’s our football consultant but he’s seen watching German football three times a month then going coaching the Austrian team two times a month. “That’s not going to work because people are going to say ‘hang on, who’s in the director’s box? What’s Darren Fletcher doing? What’s John Murtough doing? What’s Ralf Rangnick doing wherever he’s watching an Austrian player? “I don’t think they can afford that at this moment in time.

Konate signed for Liverpool last summer from RB Leipzig. The Red paid around £36m to bring him to the Premier League. The centre-back has been a bit-part player this term. This has largely been down to the form of Joel Matip and Van Dijk. Klopp’s Liverpool contract: Great for the Premier League, bad for Premier League clubs The 22-year-old has still impressed when given the chance though. He has started 20 games across all competitions. His latest start came against Villarreal at Anfield in midweek in the semi-finals of the Champions League. Carragher thinks Konate will be playing more regularly next season as he is a “fantastic” talent: “[Konate] is great, isn’t he? Joe Gomez is having a very hard time getting back into the team – he is playing right back at the moment,” Carragher said on the ‘It’s a Funny Old Life’ podcast. “But the three now, wow. I think Konate, next season, might become the first choice to partner Virgil van Dijk. “He may just edge Matip, not that Matip has done anything wrong. I just think Konate is that young and he is that good that you have to just go and let him play. “He’s getting a lot of games now – but he is fantastic.” Elsewhere, Jurgen Klopp believes him signing a new contract is the start of a new era at Liverpool: “We don’t think about changing the team in the next two or three years or whatever, but you have to prepare the little things so that you are ready for the future as well,” he said. “That’s why I really think it’s a really good place to be or a good place to join, if not the perfect place. “We cannot wait 10 years. We have to do it now. It’s no threat. This is only the start, to be honest. That’s the plan, that we really, really go for it. “There’s nothing guaranteed, it’s why we have to enjoy the journey.

Get your views in to theeditor@football365.com… Why Evertonians are behind Lampard There’s been an awful lot of guff about Frank Lampard on these pages recently, from your writers and mailboxes alike. Some of it borne out of rivalry; some, presumably, out of jealousy and spite. (Why on earth would a fan of another club care whether he deserves the EFC job or not, if such a thing could even be assessed?) So, I thought I’d try to articulate why I and many other Evertonians are inclined to defend him. Firstly, the mess at the club is not his fault. Our squad was compiled by no less than 8 different managers, together with 2 different DoFs and 2 board members who each have/had their own opinions. Some of those people were absolutely useless at their jobs. Many of the managers have opposing styles and some even seem to have been appointed as a direct reaction to the previous (different) playing style not working out. One mailboxer said that Lampard has had access to resources many clubs can’t dream of. Has he though? We are hamstrung by FFP rules now and he joined with only a few days of the transfer window remaining when we’d already conducted most of our business at the behest of the previous manager and DoF (a fine example of the complete lack of planning at the top level – I mean, selling Luca Digne to please Benitez and then firing Benitez almost immediately afterwards really takes le gateau). We had a world class number 10 in Rodriguez whom Benitez banished to the gulf because of a grudge held since they were in Madrid together many years ago and our other number 10 has been dropped from the squad because he’s [redacted for legal reasons]. Our best defender (Mina) has legs made of cheese and our main striker has been injured for much of the season and now seems more bothered about chasing modelling gigs than loose balls in the box. Secondly, there are reasons to like and have faith in what he says. Martinez was unrelentingly positive to the point of gaslighting, Allardyce tried to claim Unsworth’s results as his own, Koeman seemed to think he was above it all and Benitez was thoroughly dour (and was never going to be one of us) but Frank genuinely seems pleased to be here and is actually telling it like it is. Yes, he has complained about refs but we’ve had some shocking decisions go against us during his tenure and he’s not made a habit of it like many others do. When we’ve played well, he’s complimented the team; when we’ve shown a complete lack of bollocks, he’s not been afraid to call them out too. F365 has picked up on him pointing to the state of results before we came but he’s right – they were absolutely shite. Thirdly, there are signs that we are moving in the right direction. We are playing passes around again (ok, except against the red shite), pressing again and showing some fight again. Iwobi looks like a different player, Gordon is improving by the week (needs to learn to stay on his feet, mind), Mykolenko seems to have settled nicely now and we’ve even seen flashes (if only flashes so far) of what Dele Alli can do. The challenge is achieving consistency now and preventing Keane and Holgate from being distracted by passing bumblebees. Who knows? Stranger things have happened. Finally, well, sooner or later we’ve got to back someone right? I’ve had friends who follow other clubs tell me that we should sack him and bring Allardyce back for the last few games. To me, that’s madness and the exact sort of knee-jerk decision making is what got us into this mess in the first place. Maybe Lampard will prove to be a very good manager, maybe he won’t and we’ll get relegated. Either way, though, I believe he deserves a proper chance (and from you lot too). BestPhilT Big Weekend: Newcastle v Liverpool, Phillips against Man City, Arsenal, Lampard faces Chelsea  Is Klopp’s Liverpool’s greatest-ever signing? I write this moments after the news of Klopp signing of a new contract that keeps him at the club until 2026. I was so happy that I can’t remember the last time I was this happy about a current LFC employee signing a contract extension. It got me thinking, is Jurgen Klopp the greatest signing in the history of LFC? There are many contenders but for me it comes down to three, Kenny Dalglish, Bill Shankly, Jurgen Klopp. I’m not old enough to have seen a Bill Shankly side but we obviously know his legend and my dad has told me enough times to know what this man did for the club, he took us from the old 2nd division and made us the champions three times under his stewardship as well as two FA cups and a UEFA cup. But it wasn’t just the trophies he won that made him so revered, as we’re seeing with Klopp now he changed the whole ethos of the club, he turned a crumbling local football club into league and European champions and what he put in place stayed for years and helped turn the club into behemoth we see today. Again I was too young to see Kenny Dalglish play in his pomp but from old video and tales off my pops I know all too well that he was one of the greatest players to ever pull on a red shirt. He won 7 league titles and 3 European cups as well as a number of FA/league cups. He was a magician with the ball at his feet and scored some wondrous goals and to this day my dad says there will never be another Dalglish, he said that Suarez came closest to what Dalglish brought to the team. What sets Dalglish apart is that he transferred his winning playing style to management too winning the league twice and two FA cups as manager. He was also the rock that the whole city clung to in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster. He’s still a massive figure at the club today with a stand named after him and all the respect and adulation that he deserves. Jurgen Klopp. What else can I say that hasn’t already been said, the man is a genius and much like Shankley before him he rejuvenated a sleeping giant and turned us into one of if not the best side in Europe for a number of years winning the league and Champions league in the face of financially doped opposition. He’s put into place an ethos and a system that should see us well for years after he leaves and he’ll leave a lasting legacy on the club much like the men I’ve already mentioned. So to answer my question, is Jurgen Klopp the greatest signing in the history of the football club? No, not yet. That title goes to Sir Kenneth Mathieson Dalglish but for Klopp just be in the conversation with him and Shankley speaks volumes. To the mailbox, who is the greatest signing in the history of your club?MickT Liverpool  Second place is first loserDom Littleford, no-one cares about the second tallest man and no-one who isn’t a Liverpool fan will have them as a great team for Rumbelows cup wins or losing the league by 11mm (trust Liverpool fans, inventors of the net spend league and the VAR league to add a further measure of total irrelevance just to make them sleep better at night. How about a slip measure too?). Trophies are what matters and now it is pretty much just winning the league or Champions league that really matter in terms of going down as a good side. Even the FA Cup is only the 3rd most prestigious trophy for an English club. That’s not to say any premiership team wouldn’t love to be lifting that trophy at Wembley, especially those not in the top 2 places currently. Ask Greg Norman about greatness. Ranked number one golfer in the world for a total of 331 weeks (over 6 years), only surpassed by Tiger yet “only” won two majors. Because of this he is not even close to a conversation of the greats. There’s a big difference in being great and actually achieving greatness. Without the trophies to back up a claim you’re just an old man with biased rose tinted memories. And “the two best English clubs of all time” – LOLJon, Cape Town (it is difficult enough to separate those that win trophies making discarding those without them very easy)  …Dom’s email was perfectly reasonable in most of what it said, but I think it misses the basic point that most people are making; it’s not that this season’s Liverpool team wouldn’t be considered great, but that they’d have no claim to be amongst the very greats/the greatest. Take the 2016 Golden State Warriors in basketball Vs the 1996 Chicago Bulls. The Warriors had the better record (73 wins, 9 losses), to the Bulls 72-10, but crucially, they lost in the finals, whilst the Bulls won. The raw number might have showed they were better statistically, but so what? When the pressure was really on, they couldn’t get the job done. If Liverpool were to get 100+ points this season and finish second, not winning anything bar the Carabao, they’d be the greatest amongst all of the failures and almost greats in sport. They’d be right at the top of the list of teams that were so close, yet couldn’t get the job done. They’d be admired and revered in much the same way Charles Barkley’s Phoenix Sounds are – wonderful losers. They’d go down as another “if only…”. It’s also ludicrous to suggest a team that got 7 extra points but didn’t win the league could ever be remembered as being greater than the Invincibles, or even as great. Arsenal won the league comfortably, scored the most goals, and kept the most clean sheets. A fair number of the draws came towards the end of the season, when it was clear that going undefeated was within touching distance. They survived the pressure of achieving that historical feat. Liverpool didn’t. They finished a mighty second. A behemoth? Has there even been a behemoth quite like Sir Alex’s Man Utd? Let’s not belittle by trying to overly compare eras. It’s also petty to single out a Pires moment to retract from it. Can we not arbitrarily pick out any number of moments in any team’s season to say “they wouldn’t have done it but for X, Y, Z”? There will always be that element of luck, or something “wrong” contributing along the way to anything like that. Klopp’s teams have certainly had their moments. This isn’t about being the second tallest guy in history. It’s more so about being the second tallest that year, let alone in all of history. You could reasonably argue that some of the Real Madrid teams that finished second to Barca were great, but you hardly hear mention of them now that years have passed – and so it should be. Second won’t make them the second greatest team in history, nor does winning the league this year make Pep’s team the greatest ever. Tall as they are, if Liverpool her dunked on by Pep’ team, that will be what everyone remembers, except the nostalgic Liverpool fans who still go on about “if only Gerrard hadnt slipped…”. Enjoy,Soheil.  Stopping Salah Alot of comparison of Grealish and Salah’s rates of getting fouled per minute, foul per dribble or whatever in the afternoon mailbox – is it racism, Liverpool bias or whatever (I’m not getting into that). Isn’t the big factor that people are overlooking style of play? It seems to me that Salah gets fewer fouls because he’s good enought to power through and just score a goal instead. When I watch Grealish, he doesn’t really try and score goals, or create goalscoring opportunities, I honestly think that he’s playing almost exclusively to try and draw a foul. People are trying to suggest that there should be direct correlation between quality of player and fouls won, but while difficulty to play against is clearly a factor, its not the only factor. Someone flagged that Messi gets fouled significantly less often than Grealish and for me, that says everything. For Messi, a good days work is bagging a couple of goals and maybe an assist. For Grealish, its luring at least four people into kicking his shin in attacking areas. Salah is more Messi than Grealish – that’s a good thing!Andy (MUFC)  …Has anyone considered that Mo Salah’s low fouls per minute / per dribble / per whatever are so low because the guy is the world’s best and nobody can get close enough to him to foul him? Same can’t be said for Grealish, Gordon or anyone else. Seems like an obvious explanation.Mark, LFC, Hong Kong  …Lots of people upset at me suggesting Salah gets fewer decisions because of the colour of his skin. There’s lots of unconscious bias in every aspect of our lives. There are numerous studies that prove it (e.g. people with certain types of names being less likely to be invited to interviews, having a certain skin colour resulting in it being more likely you’re searched by the police). Sometimes these biases exist because an individual might be racist and sometimes they exist because of endemic or institutional types of racism. I am also glad that everyone tells us that the most fouled players include Zaha and Toney and therefore statistically I must be wrong. Someone also suggested I should engage my brain on this basis. Thankfully I did engage my brain before I wrote in in the first place and looking at most fouled players in the league is basically the most stupid way possible of using statistics. If you can accept that a more accurate way of representing who’s getting a disproportionate number of decisions would be touches per foul then the data shows…. Zaha still up there – a foul every 12 touches Maddison – 15 Grealish – 18 Pulisic – 18 Kane/Vardy/Bowen/Sterling – 25 Salah – 61 I totally get that lots of white people prefer to bury their heads in the sand and not think that anything is to do with skin colour. The claims of “There’s no racism issue in Britain” carries about as much weight as the people who claim there’s no paedophiles in the Angola (where the age of consent is 12 years old). Accepting there is a possibility of some kind of weird non-football reason why someone like Salah gets fewer decisions per touch doesn’t close off discussions about racism like one mailboxer suggested in the afternoon. If anything it is helpful because if the PGMOL or UEFA did try to understand what unconscious explanation existed for it then they could train officials to eliminate whatever it might be. Whilst I did imply it was a race issue I am really open to the possibility that it could be all sorts of other things resulting in this outcome. The question is – can anyone from the afternoon mailbox actually think through what I’ve said above and accept it just might be a race issue?Minty, LFC  …Lee’s mail was a great example of how badly statistics can get mangled in the wrong hands. First off, pointing to the fact that Salah has only one card for diving doesn’t mean he doesn’t regularly dive. You can do it while being really good at conning the referee, so that’s an oversimplistic conclusion. Anyone who watches Salah knows that, like most modern attackers, he does like to go down easy from time to time. ‘He is literally the harshest treated wide forward in all of Europe by referees. That not even hyperbole it’s just statistical fact’ he goes on to claim, pointing to numbers relating to how often he gets free-kicks. Nope, it’s hyperbole. To do a proper analysis, you’d need to consider some of the (countless) variables at play, such as, just for starters, how many times each player gets tackled per 90 mins. You might consider that, fabulous player that he is, Salah often finds himself with large amounts of space to run into and defenders can’t catch him. Liverpool are all about those quick turnovers and when it works, they are often in oodles of space. Conversely, with Grealish, it doesn’t matter if he’s ‘not on Salah’s level’. It matters more the type of player he is, especially as the seasons referred to in his data are presumably the three before this. Grealish was the go-to guy making runs from midfield for Villa, switching wings, taking it in tight areas, looking to draw fouls to alleviate pressure, and dare I say it, going down easy from time to time. It stands to reason that a player like that is fouled more. Perhaps Salah is that intelligent a player he moves it as quickly as possible and doesn’t take too many touches like Grealish tends to do. As for the thing regarding teams with English attackers getting more penalties, this looks a spurious correlation. Looks more like 4 of the Top 5 league places were in the Top 5, along with one outlier, in Brighton. This would be expected. Both City and Brighton were on 9, followed by Newcastle on 7. And then 5 teams (25% of the league) all stuck on 6. It almost sounds like the data is normally distributed, and there’s some chance variation going on, but you can’t come to many conclusions without doing lots of stretching. Of course we’d be able to assess this better if Lee actually linked to all the data he is talking about. If he does want to know more about how correlation is not causation, he should Google ‘spurious correlations’, and learn about the TERRIFYING link between high cheese consumption and people dying by getting tangled up in bedsheets.Pablo, MUFC, Dublin, getting that stats party started….

SoC  …You know on closer inspection that Ronaldo lad is really good at football. He’s probably not the problem at Man United.Robbie DFC  …Imagine thinking Ronaldo was the issue. With a team like Liverpool or City, he would have scored over 50 goals this season across all competitions. Single handedly carrying a below par United across the finishing line. This season should be counted as one of his finest, seeing what kind of a team he is playing for and how much impact he single handedly has had on the season. I can count atleast 10-12 separate occasions where he has won us some points and carried us in a game. On the other hand you got 100m Lukaku, 71m Havertz & 50m Werner who all combined still do not possess half the skill Ronaldo does, or else it would have been 5-1.Aman (Great ball by Matic though, twice in two weeks now)   ",positive,Liverpool,14

The pressure at the bottom of the table has shifted on to 18th-placed Everton and Leeds, who dropped to 17th following Burnley’s win. How Liverpool winning the Quadruple would help ‘banter club’ Man Utd move forward An own goal from James Tarkowski handed the home side the lead, and the visitors can consider themselves unlucky with the manner of the goal, as Juraj Kucka’s strike rebounded off the crossbar and into the net off the back of the Burnley defender. Burnley left it late to find a leveller, with Jack Cork heading in an 83rd-minute equaliser before Josh Brownhill’s strike sealed the comeback victory for the visitors. The Hornets had started the game second from bottom and nine points behind their opponents with five games remaining, however they now require wins in all their remaining matches this season as well as a big goal-difference swing to remain in the top flight. Burnley’s turnaround after parting company with Sean Dyche continued, with the Clarets taking 10 points from four games since Mike Jackson took over at Turf Moor. Watford opened the scoring with an eighth-minute own goal from Tarkowski. Joao Pedro had an opportunity to double his side’s lead in the 14th minute when he cleverly controlled a long ball from goalkeeper Ben Foster, taking the ball away from the defender, before firing over the bar. 🤩 𝗩𝗜𝗖𝗧𝗢𝗥𝗬 𝗔𝗧 𝗩𝗜𝗖𝗔𝗥𝗔𝗚𝗘 𝗥𝗢𝗔𝗗!!!#WATBUR | #UTC pic.twitter.com/8vz2vy6TBI — Burnley FC (@BurnleyOfficial) April 30, 2022 Burnley looked to hit back, with their first significant chance of the game, but Brownhill’s strike from distance skidded wide of the target. The visitors looked to have been given a way back into the game when referee Craig Pawson pointed at the penalty spot, but it was correctly overturned by VAR and a free-kick awarded instead. Burnley looked to get on the front foot at the start of the second half, with Nathan Collins attempting to lift the ball goalwards, only for Foster to make a straightforward save. However, Ismaila Sarr drove forward to create an opportunity, and the ball fell to Kucka, but his well-hit strike was saved by an outstretched Nick Pope. Burnley had a good chance in the 74th minute when Ashley Barnes’ header was tipped onto the crossbar by Foster who then managed to scramble the ball away. Foster had to make another save less than four minutes later with Burnley continuing to push for the equaliser. Burnley had been pushing throughout the second half for an equaliser, which came in the 83rd minute, as Cork timed his run well to head home from a ball from Charlie Taylor down the left. Less than three minutes later the Clarets had taken the lead, with Watford struggling to contain the visitors. The hosts were unable to clear their lines before the ball fell to Brownhill who fired it into the bottom corner, before sprinting the length of the pitch to celebrate with the travelling support.

https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-everton-1-0-chelsea-substance-over-style-relegation-dogfight,Everton substance over style earns Lampard huge Chelsea scalp in relegation dogfight,"It was a huge win for Chelsea legend Frank Lampard’s Everton, who played with the fight and desire befitting what is turning into quite the relegation battle. It was as frustrated as Chelsea have looked, and they’ve played this game at least 25 times this season. They had 78 per cent of the ball, did nothing with it and allowed themselves to be riled by Everton. Kai Havertz was the case in point. He had 30 touches in the first half but none in the box and spent most of the time being wound up by Yerry Mina, who dealt with him brilliantly. Everton were aggressive and defended as one. The problem, if you can call it one, was their inability to string more than two passes together. Abdoulaye Doucoure was excellent, Fabian Delph was typically dynamic, but neither of them were able to put their foot on the ball and dictate play for more than a few seconds. They were relying on a Chelsea mistake, which Cesar Azpilicueta dutifully proferred shortly after half-time. The Chelsea captain had plenty of time to play the ball long for Reece James or pass it back to Edouard Mendy, did neither and was robbed by Richarlison, who calmly slotted the ball into the corner. The ploy to frustrate that ended in defeat to Liverpool is a viable method against this Chelsea side, who have been profligate in one box and mistake-ridden in the other for weeks. Bide your time and they will hand you a reward for your patience and hard work. And as Chelsea tried to break out of their funk, with Jordan Pickford making one brilliant save to deny Azpilicueta after Mason Mount hit both posts, before getting the ball smashed in the chops from the resulting corner, Everton could easily have doubled their lead as Richarlison continued to be buzz around and irritate the Chelsea defence. The Brazilian was at his pestering best and had to be replaced in the 80th minute, having run himself into the ground. It wasn’t pretty from Everton. There was very little skill and only fleeting quality to speak of, but they did the ugly stuff so well. It’s as though they have now finally realised they’re in a relegation battle and – roared on by the Goodison Park crowd – are weighting their efforts hugely in favour of substance over style. That’s absolutely how it should be. Frank Lampard, frequently criticised for his inability to organise his teams defensively, both in his time at Chelsea and more recently with Everton, played this one perfectly. They sat deep for the majority of the game, allowing no space for Havertz or Timo Werner to hurt them in behind, pushing up occasionally to press in packs and harass what is an increasingly shaky Chelsea backline into mistakes. And they fully deserved the victory. Pickford did make some world class saves, but an Everton xG of 1.82 to Chelsea’s 0.94 illustrates just how effective the home side were compared to their opponents. They played Chelsea at a good time – Thomas Tuchel’s side don’t appear to have anything left in the tank this season – but if Everton can harness the passion they showed on Sunday and use that as the bedrock for their remaining five games, they will still be a Premier League outfit next season.

https://www.football365.com/news/opinion-premier-league-winners-losers-everton-zaha-arteta-norwich-marsch,"Everton top Premier League winners and losers as Zaha, Arteta, Norwich and Marsch all feature","Everton will do well to remember that ritual again this season. Wilfried Zaha gets praise but Norwich, Watford and Jesse Marsch do not. Winners Everton Any Everton supporter with a proclivity for ritualisation might find these last few weeks of the season particularly taxing. It is basic human nature to superstitiously recreate certain behaviours and practices – wearing a supposedly ‘lucky’ item of clothing or following a specific morning routine – in the hope of capturing that same positive energy. Fans might not be able to control what the players do, but if setting off early morning fireworks outside the opposition hotel, carrying an incredibly tranquil dog aloft through a raucous crowd, noisily welcoming the team bus, playing a game of catch with Richarlison and a flare and hiding the match ball up your jumper during stoppage time preceded a crucial victory over the reigning world and European champions, it might be worth trying again for the last five fixtures. Everton will be petrified of changing anything, considering how long it has taken to stumble upon a formula that works. After three wins and a draw in their opening four games, the longest unbeaten run the Toffees have been on in the Premier League this season is two matches. That surely has to change at some point before the end of the campaign for them to survive. But after watching that gap to safety extend to five points before kick-off on Sunday, Everton finally produced under pressure against Chelsea. It was a dogged, determined performance typified by Jordan Pickford’s brilliance, Yerry Mina’s snide and the industry of Demarai Gray and Richarlison, who combined for the winner. The only negative is that Frank Lampard’s side have two fixtures remaining at Goodison Park in comparison to three more trips away. Stock up on sparklers, prepare the calm canines and wear the baggiest clothes possible for that four-day period in which Brentford and Crystal Palace visit Merseyside, because Everton are 10th in a home table – and bottom, at least three points behind every other team in an away one – for a reason. Everton substance over style earns Lampard huge Chelsea scalp in relegation dogfight  BurnleyWhile there were 5,787 days between the amassing of Michael Jackson’s seven UK number ones, the accrual of ten Premier League points has taken Mike Jackson barely a fortnight. Burnley have won three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since April 2019. That same sequence of results – 2-0 against Wolves, 1-3 at Bournemouth and 2-0 against Cardiff – just so happens to contain the previous instance of the Clarets coming from behind to win away in the league. An Ashley Barnes own goal gifted Eddie Howe’s Cherries a fourth-minute lead but the striker rounded off the scoring early in the second half to complete a fine recovery. Three years later, James Tarkowski handed Watford the advantage after eight minutes by accidentally rebounding a shot into his own net. Barnes was central to their revival again, an inspired substitute for Wout Weghorst with half an hour remaining. It changed the angle and method of attack and Watford could not sustain the pressure. This unorthodox caretaker reign has reignited a fading survival bid but also reinvigorated a squad which looked quietly fractured and bereft. The Clarets have scored six goals in four games since Sean Dyche’s departure, each from different players in Wout Weghorst, Connor Roberts, Nathan Collins, Matej Vydra and now the unlikeliest double act of Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill. That the result effectively relegated Watford, barring a miracle, could have a further uplifting effect on one of the most tightly-knit squads around; seeing the pain of the drop first-hand sharpens the collective focus to avoid it. Burnley are finally on course to do just that. Michael Jackson has only been in charge of Burnley since 15 April and already has more Premier League points (10) than any Watford manager has taken this season (Munoz 7, Ranieri 6, Hodgson 9). — Richard Jolly 🇺🇦 (@RichJolly) May 1, 2022   Wilfried Zaha and Patrick VieiraThe situation could hardly have been managed any better. Patrick Vieira noted that Leeds wanted to have their cake and eat it, targeting Wilfried Zaha and fouling him four times before Kalvin Phillips tarred the Crystal Palace forward with a familiar brush.“For someone who dives so much, he has an awful lot of bruises on his ankles,” his manager said, explaining why Zaha started on the bench against Southampton. There was a time when that would have been an automatic signal of defeat for Palace. Zaha was their talisman, without whom they had little hope of operating functionally. He remains integral but this is a solid side that is adorned by his brilliance, rather than solely reliant upon it. Four minutes after Eberechi Eze’s equaliser against Southampton, Vieira threw Zaha on for the final half an hour with the express intention of occupying the home defence as a centre-forward – “We put him in the No.9 because of his mobility and the fact he can hold the ball and run in-behind” – and the results were resounding. Southampton are Zaha’s most frequent opponent. He has faced them 20 times. But his last few visits to St Mary’s had ranged from forgettable to a frustrating exhibition of his main weakness. The 29-year-old constantly toes the line and while he crossed the wrong side in rising to the provocation of James Ward-Prowse and being sent off in February 2019, Zaha somehow resisted the temptation to celebrate in the Southampton midfielder’s face upon his sublime stoppage-time winner. This is already the highest-scoring season of his career and it is no coincidence that he no longer feels the burden of constantly having to drag Palace up to his level. Vieira has built a team worthy of their crown jewel.  Jurgen KloppFive changes from midweek delivered a fifth 1-0 win of the Premier League season for Liverpool. The nature of those victories sum up Jurgen Klopp’s impeccable squad management, with each delivered by a different scorer: Naby Keita against Newcastle; Sadio Mane against West Ham in March; Fabinho against Burnley in February; Mo Salah against Aston Villa in December; and Divock Origi against Wolves the prior week. Extend it to all competitions and a sixth 1-0 win came from Diogo Jota’s effort against Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup quarter-finals. It is an enduring testament to both their strength in depth and of character.  RodriOne of the key fulcrums behind Manchester City’s unexpected set-piece dominance has been Rodri. They look far tighter defending free-kicks and corners with the midfielder in place, and much more threatening attacking them with him lurking. Perhaps behind only Ederson, it feels like Rodri is the player Pep Guardiola staked his reputation on the most. For a holding midfielder, his defensive instincts were initially poor and that counter-pressing role often proved beyond his capabilities and speed. There were few more polarising Manchester City players at one point: some saw enough to suggest he could eventually provide the necessary foundation for success, while others feared that dominance of the English game might always be just out of Rodri’s reach. He epitomises Guardiola’s reign in that way, by rising above preconceptions and changing the game to his whim instead of the other way around. His teammates have stood out at certain points, but Rodri has been a model of consistency.  Brighton’s scoutsMarc Cucurella was outstanding. Yves Bissouma was excellent. Moises Caicedo looks like an absolute Premier League natural. Enock Mwepu’s versatility has been a welcome addition to his game. Leandro Trossard has that air of a player who could raise his levels to suit the standard of most teams. Robert Sanchez matched his tally of clean sheets from last season. Those six players were signed for combined fees equivalent to the sales of Benjamin White, Anthony Knockaert and Aaron Mooy over the last two years. It is a neat party trick to master, particularly as it does not rely upon a specific manager, although the influence of an excellent coach undeniably helps the process. “We sold Ben and we’ve managed to improve. That’s the challenge in the Premier League for teams like us.It’s impossible to think you can keep hold of everybody. But we can sell at the right time, at the right price, then carry on trying to improve,” was Graham Potter’s message after the win over Wolves. Acknowledging that role in football’s food chain is important; embracing it is crucial. Marc Cucurella is unbelievably good every time I watch Brighton. So technically proficient on the ball, rounded defensive game, and can run the whole flank for the full 90 — Aaron Moniz (@amonizfootball) April 30, 2022   Cristian RomeroPatson Daka was theamuse-bouche that only intensified Cristian Romero’s appetite for his main course of Turkish affright. The halfway second challenge that directly preceded Heung-min Son’s first goal did not resemble a halfway line clash between hardened centre-halves, only because Caglar Soyuncu was entirely consumed by his counterpart. It was a comprehensive clattering. Tottenham would rise to fourth only temporarily, but even if they do eventually miss out on the Champions League there is solace in Romero’s presence. “The difficulty is, what top players are going to go to Spurs?” Roy Keane asked in January, suggesting that qualification for Europe’s premier competition was a prerequisite for attracting the best talent. Romero disproves that  Mikel ArtetaArsenal are another step closer to the ultimate justification. By the close of the January transfer window, Rob Holding had started four Premier League games and Mo Elneny just one. Eddie Nketiah’s only appearances outside of the League Cup by then had lasted no more than 19 minutes off the bench. Yet Mikel Arteta trusted all three to deliver when the inescapable time came that he had to call upon them. The Spaniard will be mocked and criticised by many onlookers but harnessing that sort of squad harmony is a delicate balancing act that only the two coaches competing for the title have managed better. The excellence of youth has underpinned this Arsenal season – Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli assisting the goals was apropos – but this is far more of a team effort than it ever has been a case of individualism.   Losers NorwichThere are deeper reads to be had on Norwich’s demise, but describing it as inevitable is misleading. In this particular season they had every chance of avoiding relegation, armed with a solid budget and the painful lessons of previous failures, with hindsight showing that other clubs could have been pulled further into danger. They should have had every advantage on Brentford, for example, yet 19 points separate the reigning second-tier champions from last season’s play-off winners. The sale of Emiliano Buendia was both predictable and early, yet the Canaries used neither the windfall nor the time nearly well enough. Most importantly, there was once an understanding and acceptance from the supporters, who long put their faith in the project and were sold The Norwich Way as the only way. That self-funded model has felt like a pre-prepared excuse all season. Other clubs have navigated those financial constraints much more convincingly. And unless the culture indelibly changes, even promotion next campaign will come with an undercurrent of trepidation from three successive top-flight relegations. Stuart Webber and his time have a few mountains to climb, not least in terms of getting supporters back onside.  Watford The feeling at Vicarage Road will be similar, albeit their fate has not been officially confirmed and the route by which it will surely be reached is vastly different. There have at least been suggestions that Watford intend on changing their ways by arming a younger manager with time and patience instead of whittling down the never-ending list of names on the combined Pozzo-Duxbury contacts book. But the jury will not expect to reconvene on that anytime soon. The next challenge will be to retain certain portions of the squad, because for all their flaws this is not a team which should be setting records for consecutive top-flight home defeats. Ismaila Sarr, Joao Pedro and Emmanuel Dennis are among those who have been gradually dragged down by an atrocious defence, despite the opposite being true last season when Xisco Munoz built upon a solid backline to gain promotion. There should be more optimism at Watford than Norwich, even if the Roy Hodgson appointment has been an unmitigated disaster for all involved. But Duxbury in particular will have questions to answer, considering he spent last May painstakingly listing all the mistakes the Hornets had learned from ahead of this season. Same again. Imagine being a #WatfordFC sub today and your manager not believing in you enough to bring you on. I hope for Duxbury’s sake the club aren’t relying on any of those subs for next year. — Rob Ezekiel (@Rob_Ezekiel) April 30, 2022   Jesse MarschIt was notable that Frank Lampard and Jesse Marsch echoed similar lines. The former described Everton’s fans as “the 12th man” and thanked them for helping “get us over the line late in the game”. The latter said that “the best part was the fans’ response” and “there was so much passion and love for the team from the fans”. The Leeds manager did stress that “that isn’t pandering to our fans” but it is a tough balance to strike. He and Lampard have both perhaps visited that well a little too often. But the key difference there is that Everton fans – rightly or wrong – welcomed their boss as the replacement for an unpopular figurehead, while Marsch started at a natural disadvantage due to the nature of Marcelo Bielsa’s relationship with the support. Few could blame him for leaning on that aspect of a 4-0 defeat in which Leeds had their chances. And in truth, they are losers mainly because of the worst possible results elsewhere. That five-game unbeaten run immediately before the Manchester City loss is keeping heads barely above water and a run-in of Arsenal, Chelsea, Brighton and Brentford has its pros and cons. Pandering or otherwise, Marsch and his players will need the fans to be in full voice.  ChelseaJose Mourinho, in combination with Steven Gerrard, successfully tricked the world into forgetting Chelsea led the Premier League table as late as April 2014; it was not only Liverpool who capitulated in that title race. On a far lesser scale, Thomas Tuchel might be accompanying his players on a slow slide down this table. The German ought to be thankful that the league season is both over soon, and will require Arsenal to face Tottenham in its penultimate week. Chelsea sit three points ahead of Arsenal and five above Spurs, all having played the same number of games. But only two of those sides have momentum currently in their favour. The Blues are finding it difficult to generate that and after a run of five consecutive Premier League wins, their form has been: L, W, L, W, D, L. Tuchel increasingly looks incapable of rousing them from this slump and preventing the individual mistakes that continue to undermine any hint of progress. The season could yet end with Wembley glory and Tuchel’s strength at Stamford Bridge thus far has been in managing those one-off games. But his reign will ultimately be measured by Premier League progress and that is a nut he still seems unable to crack.  WolvesThat unavoidable sense of flux has returned. Bruno Lage has completed a hat-trick of three successive Premier League defeats. Wolves emerged from that stuttering August start to establish their Champions League credentials, which were firmly ended by losses to Arsenal, West Ham and Crystal Palace in March. That cushion to 9th and below should be substantial enough to prevent goalless setbacks against Newcastle, Burnley and Brighton doing lasting damage, but it is demoralising for a season that promised so much to deliver so little.  The European semi-finalistsConsidering how delicately those Europa League and Europa Conference League semi-finals are poised, West Ham and Leicester’s respective seasons hang in the balance. Both are without a win in their last four Premier League games, starting from the match after their quarter-final second-leg heroics and bleeding into the final matches of their semi-finals. If either progress then that drop-off will be forgotten but it will be difficult to gather anything tangible from the season if they are knocked out in midweek.  SouthamptonA ludicrous football club. Between December 15 and February 25, Southampton went on a run of one defeat in 10 Premier League games. From March 5 to April 30, that has become a sequence of one win in nine.

The summer signings of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho were meant to catapult the Red Devils nearer to the Premier League title but they have gone backwards instead.

When asked if just United’s midfield needed rebuilding, Keane replied on Sky Sports: “Everything. Don’t get me started on the midfield. I think defensively. I’m still not happy with the goalkeeper. A couple of players up front. Huge!” Keane added: “Fernandes doesn’t get the ball back for you. Nobody mentions will he miss out. [Marcus] Rashford doesn’t do nowhere near enough. Sometimes they go to close people down but they are not really going after people, they’re just going through the motions. “We saw that again tonight with the amount of chances Chelsea created because players were going through the motions.

He has contributed nine goals and five assists in the Premier League.

The Reds produced a good display to beat Eddie Howe’s side 1-0 on Saturday with Naby Keita scoring the only goal of the game as they put pressure on Premier League title rivals Manchester City. Klopp chose to leave out Salah for their trip to St James’ Park, as well as another couple of regulars, and Liverpool should’ve probably won by a greater margin. Early winner: Jurgen Klopp gambles but Liverpool roll on with ruthless efficiency Neville doubted Klopp’s decision on Saturday, as well as Pep Guardiola’s choice to leave out Kevin de Bruyne in their 4-1 win at Leeds United, but admits that the two managers will have made their squad “feel a million dollars”. Speaking on his Sky Sports podcast, Neville said: “It’s the first time Jurgen Klopp’s left Mo Salah out in what feels like an absolute age, but he must have felt that was a game that he could leave him out in. Why he thought that, we don’t know. But when I saw that, I thought, ‘Right, what message does that send to the rest of the Liverpool players?’. “I just thought because he’s played Salah in every game, the game that he leaves Salah out in, I thought would be a risk because it tells the rest of the players something. I just thought there was a risk there when I saw the team news come through. I thought that’s a test for the other players because they know this guy is going to come straight back in against Villarreal. They know he’s number one. So can we get through without him? “So those Liverpool players come off today getting through without him, and City have got through without De Bruyne, and I think that’s the two best players – I think Van Dijk competes with Salah in terms of importance – but those are the two star players.

So to do it and then come out of it and win – you’ve empowered everybody. “You’ve made everybody feel part of it, and the strength in that squad and the commitment of everybody means that you start to blend into the feeling of every three days, you know everyone’s had a game, no one feels like there’s a first eleven. “It’s a real mistake to name your first eleven, then always play that first eleven in modern football, if you’re going to go for three and four trophies because you’re going to need those five and six and seven on the bench. And so to keep them included to make them feel part of it, get them on the pitch if you can, even it’s for 10 or 15 minutes at the end. “It’s really critical that you make everybody feel proud of being part of the squad because there is absolute certainty there is going to come a game that will catch you out, and you’re going to need two or three subs to come on and save you. That could be a defensive sub, it could be an attacking sub as well more often than not. “We had it in the Champions League final, where we had two subs come off the bench and win it for us. Liverpool have that in them, Manchester City have that in them, but you need to keep those players in form, confident, fit, part of it, energised. Making them feel like they’re contributing to the success, and it’s not just a token gesture where you’re being played in the sort of weak games.”  ",positive,Liverpool,7

Three matches, at home to Brentford and away at Brighton and Crystal Palace, for fans and many of the players to go through the motions before being able to consign a miserable campaign to the history books and never speak of it again. But is there an opportunity here for United to get a head-start on the Erik ten Hag era? Here are five ways United can salvage something from what’s left of the season… 1) Draw a line under the past by using only the players who will be at United next season We don’t yet know exactly which players they may be. Gary Neville expects Ten Hag to oversee a “brutal transition” and there is no question that a great number will be shown the door this summer. We do know, though, that those out of contract at the end of the season won’t be sticking around. So what is to be gained by playing them now? Granted, of those players approaching free agency, only really Nemanja Matic has been involved regularly of late. Paul Pogba and Edinson Cavani will tell you they are injured; Juan Mata has had the odd cameo; Jesse Lingard had been a regular on the bench prior to being omitted from the squad to face Chelsea. Matic has been involved because of injuries to Scott McTominay and Fred, both of whom should be available for the Bank Holiday game against Brentford. With almost nothing to play for, it serves no-one other than Matic and his prospects of a decent move to play him in the remaining three games. Perhaps allow any number of him, Mata and Lingard a cameo at the end of the Brentford game to say farewell to the home supporters, assuming many of them stick around that long. Pogba and Cavani need not say goodbye given they have long since f***ed off. Man Utd quintet feature in Premier League XI of players ready for step down  2) Blood the youngsters Out with the old, in with the new – the ‘new’, in the short-term at least, being some of the youngsters to have come through United’s academy. Ralf Rangnick gave midfielder Hannibal Mejbri a few minutes at the end of United’s humiliation at Liverpool and forward Alejandro Garnacho had even less time off the bench when he was offered a senior debut in injury time against Chelsea. Now the interim boss has the chance to give each a proper chance to shine rather than just the gesture of a cameo. Similar goes for winger Shola Shoretire and left-back Alvaro Fernandez, who were also primed and ready to come off the bench against Chelsea. In three games against mid-table opposition, with little on the line for either side, rarely will United get the chance to see what these kids can do in a competitive-ish environment.  3) Try Ten Hag’s preferred system Reportedly, Ten Hag is already squirrelling away for United on the condition the Red Devils don’t bother him 48 hours before Ajax play. So it would not be an unreasonable request for Rangnick to dabble with the new manager’s preferred formation in the three games that are left. Ten Hag has predominantly used 4-3-3 at Ajax while also employing a 4-2-3-1, which also happens to be Rangnick’s formation of choice. Or, rather, it is the only shape he trusts these players to stick with since they’ve proven unable or unwilling to thrive in any other setup. We have to assume Rangnick has sounded out Ten Hag on what shape he might prefer to use from the start of his reign, and while whatever answer he offers will involve new players, there is no harm in seeing how the current crop might cope in a 4-3-3. If the squad is told it is Ten Hag’s choice rather than Rangnick, it might motivate some of them to open their minds and give it their best shot, which many haven’t done for the interim manager.   4) Give Marcus Rashford a break It is hard to fathom what else United can do with Rashford to reignite the spark in the forward. He played from the start against Chelsea and looked every bit as downtrodden as he has all season. If anything, his performances and body language are getting more worrying from United’s perspective. Rangnick could keep playing Rashford and hope that his fortunes turn around in one of the three games remaining, allowing the striker to end the season on a high. But it has already reached the point where it appears United are flogging a dead horse. And it is no surprise that Rashford is knackered. Every season as a senior pro has lasted until at least mid-June, with the forward featuring in a couple of European Championships, the 2018 World Cup, the Nations League finals and other England summer internationals. Last summer seemed to take the biggest toll, with a half-fit Rashford watching much of the Euros from the bench before missing a crucial penalty in the final shoot-out. He then underwent shoulder surgery, causing him to miss the start of the season and upon returning he has never looked quite the same, either for Rangnick or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Only he and his family know what else might be affecting him away from the pitch. Many reckon United and Rashford need a break from each other, which is probably true, only not a permanent arrangement as some suggest. But there is more to be gained for both parties by sending Rashford off on holiday now. Since he has lost his spot in the England squad, he has the opportunity to take May and June to get his body and head in the best possible place for Ten Hag’s arrival.  5) End Harry Maguire’s season as well Much of the above also applies to United’s skipper, too. Rangnick says Maguire is battling to play again this season owing to a knee injury, but it is a pointless fight. His form has been so poor lately that the last thing he or United need is for the defender to return prematurely and make things even worse. Maguire is under a mega-f***-tonne of pressure and is getting very little sympathy from United fans. They were aghast at the defender being jeered on England duty, forgetting that his substitution in the Champions League was cheered by many inside Old Trafford. Maguire is not one to back down or walk away, but he needs to pick his battles. With Gareth Southgate almost certain to call him up for England’s end-of-season fixtures, Maguire could use a holiday now to clear his head and get his knee right. Maybe swerve Greece, though, big man… ",negative,Liverpool,1

After his spells at Real Madrid and Juventus, Ronaldo returned to the Red Devils last summer. A fee of around £13.5m plus add-ons was paid by Man Utd. The forward has been criticised by some this season but he has been one of few bright sparks for United. Juan Mata shows Man United what they’ve wasted in beautiful Old Trafford swansong The 37-year-old scored his 24th goal of the season on Monday night as Man Utd beat Brentford 3-0 at Old Trafford. Carragher has often questioned United’s decision to re-sign Ronaldo and he did so again on Monday. He does not feel that they “should not be buying a 37-year-old”: “My problem has always been with Man United for buying Cristiano Ronaldo. One of the biggest clubs in the world should not be buying a 37-year-old,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “I’ve always been of the opinion that they should move him on, but right now, there are so many problems – ‘I need to get a midfielder, I need to get a centre-back.’ We’ve seen this season that when Ronaldo doesn’t play or gets brought off, it’s a massive story. “If you bring in strikers, are they to play or back up Ronaldo? If you’re the new manager, you might think you don’t need that on your plate. “They’ve got other problems. Would Liverpool ring back Luis Suarez? I don’t think so. United should be getting Erling Haaland. Man City are getting him. “It’s like United are a small club. It’s like when Rooney went back to Everton. It was just to lift the fans.” Carragher also thinks it’s “nonsense” that Ralf Rangnick will be managing Austria next season. The former Liverpool defender said on Sky Sports: “Ralf Rangnick isn’t really a manager, he’s a director of football, he’s someone who helps the coaches or builds the club. “I’ll be honest with you I just don’t get that. I don’t think you can be manager of Austria and work for Manchester United. “He can work for Manchester United in that role…well that’s wrong. That should not be happening. “The manager of Austria should not be working part time for Manchester United. That’s just a nonsense! It’s one or the other.” ",positive,Liverpool,2

The Reds and the Citizens have matched each others last four results as both sides look to avoid slipping up at a crucial moment in their pursuit of the title. City currently lead Liverpool by one point with five matches of the campaign remaining with Jurgen Klopp’s side appearing to have the tougher run of fixtures. Big Midweek: City v Real, Danjuma at Anfield, West Ham, Rangnick, Forest However, Carragher believes both sides – who have only lost five matches all season between them – will drop points before the end of the season but that the forwards at Liverpool’s disposal gives them the “slight edge”. “We’re talking about two brilliant teams,” Carragher on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football. “You can’t really split them in an area of the game, but I can see both of them dropping points, I do believe that. “If you look at the attacking stats, this is when Liverpool have the slight edge, you look at the goals per game they have the slight edge. “Liverpool have scored 85 goals, Man City 80, when you talk about not having a striker the goals are still absolutely phenomenal from Man City. “The XG per game shows that Liverpool have the edge.Man City’s top scorer is De Bruyne with 11, and for Liverpool it’s Salah with 22. There’s a big difference. “Man City obviously spread the goals out a bit more, but the numbers in terms of their top scorers show Liverpool have a big advantage in attack.” 🗣 “This is where Liverpool have the slight edge.” Jamie Carragher pinpoints where Manchester City could drop points in their remaining Premier League games. pic.twitter.com/m8coIUZQMa — Football Daily (@footballdaily) April 25, 2022 Carragher added: “If Man City are to drop points, it would be down to the fact they could have games where they fail to score. “Man City have failed to score in four games this season – Liverpool only one – and they have only scored once in seven games too, so that’s 11 games where they have scored one goal or zero goals. “So, you think, if Man City are going to drop points, it must be from a 0-0, there’s been evidence of that this season in games that we’ve seen.” Speaking about both side’s defensive capabilities, Carragher continued: “We should add that lot of those games where Liverpool dropped points were early on in the season and there has been a change, defensively, in the second half of the season. “But, if Liverpool drop points, you feel like it wouldn’t be a 0-0, it would be a 2-2. “The perceived weaknesses of the two sides are that City haven’t got a striker, and Liverpool’s high line. But I think in some ways those are both strengths for them as well. “The defensive stats show City have the edge. Most people would say Liverpool have the best defender in the world in Virgil van Dijk, but as a team, City are better defensively and that might have something to do with not having a striker. “Maybe having more control of the ball in the game means people can’t attack them.Again the numbers are very close. Man City just have the edge. “Where there is a big difference is the xG per game. It’s almost a third higher for Liverpool. “There’s nothing in the clean sheets but the big one that stands out is that Manchester City have only conceded one goal from a set-piece, Liverpool seven.”  ",negative,Liverpool,16

The Reds beat the Toffees in the Merseyside derby 2-0 on Sunday but Frank Lampard’s side made life difficult for their arch-rivals before Andy Robertson broke the deadlock on 62 minutes. Jurgen Klopp brought Divock Origi and Luis Diaz off the bench and the changes worked as Origi headed in the second goal from Diaz’s acrobatic effort and the Belgium international also had a hand in the opener. Here’s hoping for Everton relegation after Lampard elitism There were a few controversial moments in the game with Everton feeling they should’ve had a second-half penalty, while Sadio Mane was perhaps fortunate to stay on the pitch after poking Mason Holgate in the face. A number of comments by the Sky Sports commentary team of Martin Tyler and Jamie Carragher incensed Stubbs during the match. Stubbs tweeted: “Will have to turn this commentary off I think @Everton because it’s so biased!! “Richarlison clearly goes over on his ankle and is accused of cheating!! Liverpool class my a**e.” Will have to turn this commentary off I think @everton because it’s so biased!! Richarlison clearly goes over on his ankle and is accused of cheating!! Liverpool class my arse 🤷🏼‍♂️💙 — Alan Stubbs (@alanstubbs_6) April 24, 2022 Carragher annoyed a number of fans on social media after the former Liverpool centre-back told Richarlison to get up despite the Everton attacker rolling his ankle. “Honestly, get up. Get up, carry on,” Carragher said of Richarlison on commentary. “If [Abdoulaye] Doucoure gets a yellow card because his teammate goes down. Stupid from Doucoure trying to stop the game but Richarlison… there’s nothing wrong with him.” Stubbs appeared this morning on BBC Radio Five Live and he revealed his frustration that major decisions went against Everton. He said: “Everton had a game plan to try and frustrate Liverpool and they did that for large parts of the game. Some major decisions also went against them, for instance the penalty. The first incident isn’t but the second one (Matip on Gordon) is a clear penalty there is no doubt about that. The referee is in a great position and he bottled it. There is no other way to describe it. “Everton have been on the end of dubious VAR decisions in recent months but that is not the reason they are in the position they are in.” When asked whether Everton will stay up, Stubbs added: “I hope so. I have everything crossed. But it’s going to be close.” Stubbs also urged the players to show they have what it takes to stay in the Premier League after Burnley’s victory on Saturday plunged the Toffees into the relegation zone. Stubbs continued: “I know Frank Lampard’s record doesn’t look great but he has inherited a group of players where a lot of the damage was done before him and he had to pick up the pieces. “Could he have done more? Certainly. But ultimately it comes down to the players. They have not performed well enough this season, though there has been signs of improvement in the last three performances. “When you are down the bottom every run-in is tough. They have another tough game on Sunday at home to Chelsea. “It’s not about talk, it’s about actions. We have heard the talk all season about ‘we are too good to go down’. Well now is the time for the players to stand up and be counted.”  ",negative,Liverpool,5

Jurgen Klopp changed the game by bringing on Divock Origi and Luis Diaz in the second half with the former involved in the build-up to Andy Robertson’s opening goal before getting on the scoresheet himself. Everton youngster Anthony Gordon was booked for diving in the first half under a challenge from Naby Keita and the simulation came back to haunt him in the second half as he was denied a penalty. ‘Good riddance, Everton’, says the Merseyside derby Mailbox… With the score still level at 0-0, Gordon – who had caused Liverpool problems all game – went down after being bundled over by Joel Matip but the referee waved away his penalty protests. But Campbell was adamant that it should’ve been a spot-kick and insists the referee “bottled” the decision. Campbell said on Sky Sports: “This is a pen for me. It’s a push in the back. He’s in the box, it’s a push in the back. He’s nowhere near the ball, he pushes him. “You see that. If that was at the other end, I’m sure this stadium would have gone crazy. That’s the one break that Everton needed. “I thought the referee bottled it a little bit, if I’m honest with you.” 🗣 “I’ve gone one v one with him and I’ve got the better of him and he’s stood on me foot.” Anthony Gordon explains why he feels he should’ve had a penalty and that he didn’t deserve a yellow card for his “dive” pic.twitter.com/lhCkgxiwqB — Football Daily (@footballdaily) April 24, 2022 Former Liverpool centre-back Jamie Carragher warned Gordon that he doesn’t want to get a reputation as a diver. Carragher added: “He’s got to be careful, Anthony Gordon. He’s a great lad and a great player, one of the best players on the pitch today, caused Liverpool massive problems. “But he’s just got to be careful of that, it’s not the first time, the one in the first half, and it definitely will be in referee’s heads.” Fellow pundit Graeme Souness reckons Gordon “planted a seed” in the referee’s mind after the simulation in the first half. Souness said: “He’s planted a seed in the referee’s head, in the very first few minutes when he dived to try and get a penalty. “You can bet, if we’re players out there, we’re in the referee’s ear: ‘he’s a diver, ref.’ You’re planting a seed in the ref’s head as well.”  ",positive,Liverpool,4

A lot of money has been spent on the squad and you expect them to be higher up the league. For a club like Everton not to win away from home since August is ridiculous.” Graeme Souness says he wants the Toffees to avoid the drop, but is not holding his breath. The former Reds captain said:“It was the easiest way to play football for Everton. They didn’t ask the players to step up and play football, everyone was back in their own half. The only threat they had was Anthony Gordon in a race with Trent Alexander-Arnold down the left. “I’m not pooh-poohing their attitude – I’d just say it’s not that they played well. It was just about sitting in and trying to nick it. Can they do that every week? I’m not sure. “I want Everton to survive. I lived in the city for a long time. They are a big proud football club with a fantastic history. It’s going to be difficult for them though. They can’t play like this in the last six games.

A temporary amendment to the rules had been implemented to increase the number of substitutions from three when football resumed in the summer of 2020 following its mid-season suspension because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The changes were extended last summer by the International Football Association Board’s advisory panel for a further 18 months before a permanent decision was made in October to keep the option of using five substitutes in place. Liverpool trio among Europe’s top five for most appearances… However, despite clubs across Europe following IFAB’s proposal, the Premier League had decided against using the recommendations for the 2020-21 campaign and instead reverted back to three substitutions.

The German has been United’s interim boss since the start of December. He will be replaced this summer by current Ajax manager Erik ten Hag. Manchester United scout watches £100m target subbed at HT; Everton’s Richarlison hope Under Rangnick, Man Utd have only won one of their last seven games across all competitions. They have been beaten by Everton, Liverpool and Arsenal on this run. Anthony Elanga started last time out as they drew 1-1 against Chelsea.Hannibal Mejbri,Shola Shoretire, Alvaro Fernandez andAlejandro Garnacho Ferreyra were on the bench. United host Brentford on Monday night. Owen has called for Rangnick to give the club’s youngsters some game time against the Bees: “Now United have little to play for, I’m curious whether Ralf Rangnick will change the personnel,” (quotes via The Express). “There’s a lot of promising youngsters at the club, now would be an ideal opportunity for them to get some game time ahead of the new boss coming in this summer. “Brentford have had such a great season and can travel to Old Trafford full of confidence after that draw against Spurs. They’ve been very organised in recent weeks, and make it difficult for each side they face. “I’m still going to pick United. Brentford will be difficult to break down, I’m going for 1-0.” Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson has also made a prediction for Monday night’s clash at Old Trafford. The former Arsenal man thinks Man Utd and Brentford will draw 2-2. He believes this will be a “hard game” for the hosts: “Manchester United have more immediate concerns, however, and this’ll be a hard game for them,” Merson told Sportskeeda. “The way Brentford have been playing, they could pull this off. Who would’ve thought this was possible one, two, or ten years ago? “Brentford are going to go out there expecting to win this game. They’ll have a go at Manchester United and I think they’ll cause them a few problems this weekend.” ",negative,Liverpool,1
https://www.football365.com/news/neville-destroys-man-utd-players-farce-liverpool-city-comparison,"‘Farce’ – Neville destroys Man Utd players with Liverpool, City comparison","Gary Neville has accused Man Utd players of having “over-inflated egos” and reckons none of them would get into the current Liverpool or Man City sides. The Red Devils suffered another blow to their chances of qualifying for the Champions League next season after they lost 1-0 to out-of-form Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday. Defeat against the Toffees means Man Utd are now six points behind fourth-placed Tottenham in the Premier League table with seven matches to go. ‘Laughable’ Liverpool exposed; Man Utd must shift quartet out To make matters worse, their last seven games of the season look extremely tricky to navigate, with Liverpool, Arsenal, Brighton and Crystal Palace to play away and Norwich, Brentford and Chelsea to face at Old Trafford. After watching Man City and Liverpool put on an amazing spectacle on Sunday, Neville tore into Man Utd after the weekend’s results. “I’ve got very few words left for Manchester United,” Neville said on his Sky Sports podcast. “No anger, no comment anymore. They are a bit of a farce; you almost expect it from them. The players are taking Ralf Rangnick down with them. They are bad. “When I look at Manchester City and Liverpool, they have humble football players; no over-inflated egos, they understand their position, the team comes first. “There isn’t one Manchester United player that would get into any of those two teams, so why would you have an over-inflated ego, think you didn’t have to work hard, or be spiritless? I don’t see anything anymore.” And Neville now thinks Rangnick’s reputation is now taking a hit with the Man Utd interim boss looking ‘weaker and vulnerable on the touchline’ in recent weeks. Neville added: “Ralf Rangnick came with an incredible reputation but he’s now starting to be wounded by what’s happening around him and he looks weaker and vulnerable on the touchline due to the performances of players on the pitch, who have nothing to do with him. “Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is a good man, the players liked him and yet they turned him over. It’s a real difficult position for the club to be at. “I feel like most Manchester United fans at this moment in time in that I don’t know where to turn next or what’s going to happen. “I’m living on the feeling that the club one day will return. The club will rise again but this is getting low, real low. But it will come back, and you look forward to that day. “Those Liverpool fans over my shoulder have been where Manchester United have been, they have been in those low moments when Manchester United were winning, when they maybe didn’t have a team they could be proud of. Maybe it’s time for those Manchester United players to have a look at themselves. “I do believe players want to do well, but what they are showing at this moment in time is nowhere near good enough.”  ",positive,Liverpool,6
https://www.football365.com/news/arsenal-star-sake-names-toughest-opponent-embarrassed,‘He embarrassed me’ – Arsenal star Saka names toughest opponent,"Arsenal star Bukayo Saka has named Barcelona’s Sergio Busquets as his toughest opponent, recalling an occasion when the midfielder “embarrassed” him. Saka has made 122 appearances in all competitions since making his senior debut for Arsenal in 2018. READ MORE: Premier League winners and losers after City v Liverpool When asked who his toughest opponent was in an interview with GQ, Saka named Barcelona midfield general Busquets. The Spain international has won eight La Liga titles and three Champions League trophies in his time with the Catalan giants. Saka has come up against Busquets just once, in a pre-season friendly in August 2019. Saka said: “The way he just so elegantly turned me! I came at him to press him, I tried to fake this side then go to the other, and the way he just embarrassed me: I was just like, yeah, this guy is elite. “The way he just took me out of the play, I said, ‘Respect.’ [Busquets] is three steps ahead of everyone and that’s what makes you a top footballer. That’s what I realised that day.” Saka has played in a number of positions for the Gunners, including wing-back and central midfield. But he now operates on the left wing and is a key part of Gareth Southgate’s England squad. The 20-year-old grew up idolising Barcelona legend Lionel Messi and recalled one of the Argentinian’s famous Copa del Rey goal against Athletic Club as the one he would most like to have scored himself. Saka added: “Because of the moment,” said Saka. “I think I would say Leo Messi’s goal in the Copa del Rey final against Athletic Club. The one where he dribbled everyone. Now that I play, I can see how hard it is to score that goal. “People are trying to kick him, to bring him down in the process, and he just keepsgoing, and he still scored in the final, as well.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/emery-klopp-basel-bar-liverpool-path-european-glory/bltf07fd194f2d47eef,"Emery, Klopp and the night in a Basel bar which set Liverpool on the path to European glory","Bed was the only thing on Jordan Henderson’s mind when he returned to Basel’s Novotel hotel. It was just before midnight, and it had not been a good day. Having led at half-time, Liverpool had lost, painfully, to Sevilla in the final of the Europa League, their 3-1 defeat ensuring another trophyless season for the men from Anfield. Henderson himself had not even made it off the bench. Having rushed back from a knee injury to feature, the captain watched on as Jurgen Klopp instead turned to Divock Origi, Joe Allen and Christian Benteke in a fruitless attempt to turn the tide. Back at the hotel, the plan was to switch off, to try and force some sleep and hide from the disappointment and the bitterness. “To not see anybody and get my head down,” as he put it. Klopp had other ideas. “You’ve got 10 minutes,” the manager told his players and staff. “And then I want you all back down here in the bar. All of you.” Henderson was reluctant - “It was the last thing I wanted, to be honest” - but he and his team-mates obliged. And as the minutes passed, the pain slowly began to subside. Soon there were smiles and there was laughter. Perspective had been restored, positivity had returned. Some time in the early hours, Klopp grabbed a microphone. “We are Liverpool, tra-la-la-la-la,” he sang, urging the rest to join in. They did. Defiance in Switzerland. It was daylight before the last of the stragglers headed to their rooms. Almost six years on, Henderson looks back on that impromptu party and recognises its significance. “I will always remember it,” he told reporters before Liverpool’s victory over Villarreal in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final last week. “The manager was different, his mentality was different. It felt as if he knew it was the start of something to come.” Klopp had been as saddened as anyone by what had happened in St Jakob Park, cutting a forlorn figure as his side fell apart in the second half. But in his post-match press conference, he would deliver one of the most prescient quotes of his Liverpool reign. ""Someday,” he told reporters, “everybody will say that Basel was a very decisive moment for the wonderful future of Liverpool FC.” Much has changed since then, of course. Only four of Liverpool’s 18-man squad - Henderson, Origi, James Milner and Roberto Firmino - remain, and the Reds have long moved past the Europa League as a point of reference. If they finish the job against Villarreal on Tuesday, they will contest their third Champions League final in five seasons. Klopp has built an incredible side, and plenty of its origins can be traced back to Basel, and the lessons learned at the hands of Unai Emery and Sevilla. It was the manner of that defeat, for example, which convinced Klopp of the need to add serious attacking speed and a more flexible, physical kind of midfielder. He signed both Sadio Mane and Gini Wijnaldum, as well as Joel Matip, that summer, and offloaded no fewer than 15 players, including four of his 18-man squad in Basel. He had arrived on Merseyside convinced that the team he had inherited from Brendan Rodgers was a good one, but had quickly realised there were deep-rooted issues in terms of confidence and mentality. As he told his players in one memorable meeting: “nobody likes this team, not even ourselves.” Changing that mindset was already high on the agenda, but even more so after Sevilla, whose comeback opened up all of the scars Liverpool would rather have kept hidden. Put under pressure, they folded, losing their lead, their composure, their belief and finally the game. Even Klopp was criticised, spending much of the second-half attempting to whip up the crowd as his substitutions and tactical tweaks had minimal effect. “The first thing you have to do when you look at the man in the mirror is criticise yourself,” he admitted afterwards. “I can improve a lot.” He also promised that Liverpool would “use this experience together”, that they would learn and grow and improve. They did. Within 12 months they were back in the Champions League, their side then evolving further with the arrivals of Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson, as well as the perfectly-timed emergence of Trent Alexander-Arnold. They have not looked back since, nailing their recruitment and growing into one of the two best teams in Europe, and perhaps the best in Reds history. The fact there is even a discussion is remarkable, given the greats that have gone before. If May goes as well as February, March and April did, this side could end up with everything they could ever wish for - FA Cup, Premier League and Champions League, to go with the Carabao Cup they won earlier this year. In their way this week, of course, is a familiar foe. Emery hurt them with Sevilla and he could hurt them again with Villarreal, even if Liverpool looked a cut above when securing a 2-0 first leg lead at Anfield last Wednesday. A red-hot atmosphere is expected at the Estadio de la Ceramica. Villarreal have little to lose and everything to gain, and know the first goal, whenever it should arrive, would put them right back in the tie. Even if they get it, though, do not expect Liverpool to panic. Not this team. The world has changed since Basel. And Klopp and his side have their eye on Paris this time around.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/gerard-moreno-villarreal-klopp-fearing-champions-league/bltd921e1e30cc76f98,Gerard Moreno: Why Villarreal’s leading light has Klopp fearing an unlikely Champions League comeback,"Villarreal may have been comprehensively outperformed by Liverpool in their Champions League semi-final first leg, but excitement in the tiny Spanish city remains high ahead of the return fixture. Part of the reason for that, as well as for some optimism, is that Gerard Moreno may well be back on Tuesday. The forward missed the 2-0 defeat at Anfield last week with a hamstring problem, but may force the issue to appear against the Reds at La Ceramica. He is the man Jurgen Klopp highlighted as the potential danger for the second leg, and the Reds' coach was no doubt pleased to see that the Spain forward did not make the first game. “It is not over, for the second game Gerard Moreno is back,” Klopp told reporters post-match on Merseyside. “It’s half-time, no more, no less. ""How much work is left to do? The full work. Nothing has happened yet.” Without Moreno in the first leg, Villarreal’s plan did not work. They wanted to sit deep and shut down their opponents, to take a 0-0 draw or potentially more back to Spain. However, with Moreno absent, the ball did not stick upfront when they tried to clear it. The 30-year-old has a velvet touch that would have given his side some relief from Liverpool’s asphyxiating press. Pervis Estupinan’s own goal and Sadio Mane’s strike, in the space of two second-half minutes, helped Liverpool to a comfortable home victory. It was one which lured TalkSport broadcaster and former Chelsea player Jason Cundy into a broadside aimed at the Yellow Submarine, whom he accused of playing a “disgraceful” game. ""I don't know what I've just watched, but Villarreal are a disgrace,” he sneered. “That is a disgrace. UEFA must be watching that and thinking, 'We are in big trouble'. “If that's what's getting to the semi-final and facing English teams... Liverpool did not get out of second gear. It was shocking. Disgraceful. Liverpool are brilliant, but that was a disgrace to the Champions League.” Words which did not go unnoticed in Spain, with Villarreal determined to make Cundy eat them on Tuesday night. To do that, Moreno is vital. Born in Catalunya, the striker came through Villarreal’s youth teams and eventually made his first-team debut for the club in the 2014-15 campaign. The following season, he signed for Espanyol and spent three solid, if unspectacular seasons there. Villarreal brought him back in for €20 million (£17.5m/$23.5m) and he began to show his quality on a regular basis. In the 2019-20 season, he netted 18 La Liga goals in 35 appearances, before scoring 23 in 33 the following year, along with seven goals in Europe to help take the Yellow Submarine to Europa League glory. Netting against Chelsea in the European Super Cup in August, he overtook Giuseppe Rossi to become Villarreal’s all-time top scorer, and currently has 95 goals for the club. Having made his international debut in 2019, he also helped Spain reach the Euro 2020 semi-finals last summer, and if his injury problems subside, should make Luis Enrique’s 2022 World Cup roster. Despite the immense quality he possesses, both to score and create goals, but also on the ball as a dribbler, Moreno has a low profile outside of Spain, without much hype or fanfare. That could change if he becomes the wrecking ball to Liverpool’s quadruple hopes, though. Juventus and Bayern Munich have, after all, already experienced how devastating Villarreal and Moreno can be. After a 1-1 first-leg draw in Spain, the second leg against Juve was a tense 0-0 heading into the final 15 minutes. Enter Moreno. In the 78th minute he broke the deadlock from the penalty spot, with Pau Torres and Arnaut Danjuma adding further goals as Villarreal surged past the Italians. Moreno then impressed as his side beat Bayern 1-0 at home, and then set up Samu Chukwueze’s late goal at the Allianz Arena to send Villarreal through, against the odds. His absence at Anfield was a blow, although Villarreal coach Unai Emery is hopeful his team can turn the tables on Liverpool at home. “In the semi-finals, the surprise factor that we could have had in the last 16 and quarter-finals had diluted,” admitted Emery after the first leg. “Today was a question of resisting defensively to have a chance (at home) and we did it in some ways because there it will be different, and there we will get more out of it. “We know that we can compete with Liverpool but today we did not do it. In La Ceramica, we will try and make it so the game is completely different.” Moreno has 13 goals and six assists this season, down from the high standards established in previous years, but he has only made 26 appearances because of injury. When he does play, something happens. Moreno has formed a dynamic and exciting partnership with Danjuma, who often profits from clever interplay with the Spaniard. And with their talisman returning, Villarreal still believe they have a chance. “If there’s one good thing this team has it’s that it believes, and it believes the second leg will be different,” said goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli. “We have all the confidence in the world, if not we’d let them go through to the final right now. ""Tuesday will be a totally different game, I have no doubts this team will show up.” If Moreno does, and is in good enough condition, then Villarreal will too.

The Liverpool forward fluffed his lines from the spot, as the Pharaohs saw their Qatar 2022 dreams dashed in Dakar, and there had been calls for the second leg of a heavyweight African encounter to be replayed. World football’s governing body has not taken things that far, with Senegal still heading to a global showpiece in the Middle East later this year, but sanctions are being put in place. FIFA has fined Senegal’s football federation 175,000 Swiss francs as a result of the fan disorder which marred an otherwise memorable evening for the Lions of Teranga. That decision has been made after seeing Salah forced to take a penalty while blinding green lights were shone in his direction. FIFA’s disciplinary panel has also looked into a pitch invasion from Senegal supporters after Sadio Mane converted the decisive spot-kick in their shootout with Egypt. An offensive banner has also been investigated, with Senegalese authorities accused of “failure to ensure that law and order are maintained in the stadium”. A combination of all those misdemeanours has resulted in the Senegal national team being ordered to play one future fixture behind closed doors. No Mohamed Salah at the 2022 World Cup 😩 pic.twitter.com/DRVQcnFfkk FIFA’s disciplinary committee has been ruling on a number of other similar instances that have occurred in World Cup qualifying games played since the turn of the year. Nigeria, after being eliminated in a play-off clash of their own against Ghana, are also facing a one-game stadium closure as a result of disgruntled supporters invading the field in Abuja, while their FA has been stung with a fine of 150,000 Swiss francs. A penalty of 125,000 Swiss francs has been imposed on Congo and 100,000 on Lebanon, with both also seeing their terraces closed for one game, while discrimination by fans at home matches involving Chile and Colombia has resulted in fines of 95,000 and 55,000 Swiss francs respectively being handed out to the South American nations.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/johan-bakayoko-psv-teenage-star-thriving-van-nistelrooy/blt79419761189d2222,Johan Bakayoko: PSV's teenage star thriving under Van Nistelrooy,"One of the finest strikers of the 2000s, Ruud van Nistelrooy has had to wait for his chance to step into first-team management. The ex-Manchester United and Real Madrid forward has had two spells as part of the coaching staff for the Netherlands national side, while also working within the youth structure at PSV. But this summer, Van Nistelrooy will make the step up to take charge of the senior side in Eindhoven, replacing the outgoing Roger Schmidt after a season in charge of Jong PSV in the second tier of Dutch football. Given his playing career, the 45-year-old will be expected to particularly oversee improvements in attack, though there is a chance he will first have to rebuild his forward line. Cody Gakpo is expected to move on, with a host of Europe's biggest clubs - including Arsenal, Liverpool and Bayern Munich - having been linked with the 22-year-old winger. At the start of the season, the same thing was expected for Noni Madueke, but injuries have hampered the England youth international in 2021-22, meaning the Premier League and Bundesliga clubs that are keen on the forward may well decide to look elsewhere, at least for now. Regardless, Van Nistelrooy is going to require reinforcements, one of which could be the teenager that has lit up his own side this term. With just a single game of Jong PSV's season to play, Johan Bakayoko can already boast a record of 17 goals and 11 assists for the team in 2021-22, meaning he has been directly involved in a goal every 85.4 minutes in the second division. Madueke, is that you? 🧐De 18-jarige Johan Bakayoko steelt de show bij Jong PSV tegen Almere City: twee assists en een goal ✨#JPSALM pic.twitter.com/G5Cj5p0psn Given he only managed a solitary strike and three assists in 19 appearances at that level last season, that is quite some improvement from the Belgium youth international, and one which Van Nistelrooy has played a key role in. ""You can see that he has power and also a good shot,"" Van Nistelrooy told ESPN in January. ""He plays such controlled football that you forget that he is only 18. ""If he continues to invest so much in what he does, he is a boy who is on the right track to join the first team at the end of the season."" Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: That step has not quite materialised, however, with the 19-year-old having made just two appearances off the bench for PSV's senior side thus far, but that is likely to change once Van Nistelrooy takes the reins. PSV certainly envisaged him becoming a first-team player when they tempted him to join the club from Anderlecht in 2019, with Bakayoko having previously spent time at Club Brugge and Mechelen. His first two seasons with the club, though, suggested that he may be some distance off that level, and that following Madueke's path of starring for the youth sides before making an impact on the Eredivisie was unlikely. The club, though, saw things differently, and in the summer of 2021 offered the teenager a new four-year contract, which Bakayoko signed while donned in a white suit and red bowtie. ""Now it's up to me to prove that I can put up the numbers required of me,"" he said at the time. ""I want to be more decisive in terms of my stats, and I've been talking to the coaches about doing that."" He has been a man of his word, honing his finishing ability under Van Nistelrooy's watchful eye, though he is much more than a player who puts the ball in the net. Naturally left-footed, he generally plays from the right-hand side, using his speed and close control to cause nightmares for opposing full-backs before cutting inside to either score or create chances for his team-mates. With six, he has the most goals from outside the penalty area in the Dutch second tier, with his decision making in terms of when to try his luck and when to look for help much improved from previous years. ""At the beginning of 2021, Johan was not doing well,"" his agent, Gerard Witters, told Het Nieuwsblad. ""But after he got his new contract, everything changed. ""He started to boost his stats and his recent games were phenomenal. The club has told me that Johan is already better than they initially thought he would be. ""Before he sometimes played like a crazy dog. He had great qualities and was very explosive, but he produced poor crosses and took shots when they were not the best option. ""Now he knows a lot more what he's going to do and defenders can't stop him anymore, despite the fact that he always does the same movement (cutting inside).” Bakayoko's form has been particularly good since the season's winter break, with his confidence spiking after he netted four times against VVV-Venlo in January. More recently, he came off the bench for the final 33 minutes against FC Eindhoven and scored twice before assisting PSV's third goal in a game that looked to be heading for a draw until the youngster's introduction. Now the challenge becomes replicating those performances against the best teams in the land, with PSV hopeful of yet again challenging Ajax for the title after their back-and-forth race this season. His history with Van Nistelrooy should certainly help in that respect, and if the legendary striker is to succeed as a coach, then he will hope that he can soon rely on his young charge to lead the way.

Liverpool are priced at 4/6 (1.65) to score over 1.5 goals while backing the Reds to win and over 2.5 goals in the game is on offer at 6/4 (2.50).

https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-world-cup-2022-squad-which-players-gareth-southgate/blt0d5100e0d523d4ce,England World Cup 2022 squad: Which players will get the nod from Gareth Southgate & make the plane to Qatar?,"The countdown to the 2022 World Cup is well and truly on, with 23 seats on the plane to Qatar up for grabs as Gareth Southgate pieces together his plans for another shot at global glory with England. The Three Lions reached the semi-finals in Russia four years ago, only to come up short against Croatia, and reached a final at Wembley Stadium in Euro 2020 before suffering more penalty shootout heartache against Italy. Positive steps are being taken in the right direction, but can a 56-year wait for tangible success be brought to a close in the Middle East and who will be charged with the task of landing major silverware? GOAL takes a look at the hopefuls longing to see their names called. Jordan Pickford.That's all. pic.twitter.com/BKSqEuwXWg Everton keeper Jordan Pickford has been Southgate’s go-to option between the sticks, as he blends shot-stopping ability with impressive distribution off the deck, and appears guaranteed to make the cut if fit. The same could be said for Aaron Ramsdale following his eye-catching campaign at Arsenal, with the 23-year-old another of those that is as comfortable with his feet as he is with his hands. Burnley’s Nick Pope has often been third in line for England and will hope to see that trend continue when some big calls are made ahead of a showpiece event in November. Sam Johnstone is playing Championship football at West Brom this season, but remains in contention, while Jack Butland could surge up the pecking order if a starting berth is retained at Crystal Palace. Etienne Green has been making quite a name for himself at Saint-Etienne in France but he, along with fellow England U21 international Josef Bursik of Stoke, remains one for the future. Alex McCarthy and Fraser Forster have been in and around senior squads before, but would need untimely setbacks to be endured by others in order to see a path clear for them. Player Selection odds Jordan Pickford 1/12 Aaron Ramsdale 1/10 Nick Pope 4/9 Sam Johnstone 2/1 Jack Butland 5/1 Etienne Green 20/1 Alex McCarthy 25/1 Freddie Woodman 28/1 Fraser Forster 33/1 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗼𝗻𝗲. 𝗕𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗵 𝗼𝗻𝗲. 𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗹 𝗼𝗻𝗲.England right-back edition 💫 pic.twitter.com/nAwhrBkm8H There are a number of spots in Southgate’s defensive unit that appear to have been filled, with eight players currently odds-on to make England’s final 23-man party. Harry Maguire of Manchester United, Manchester City centre-half John Stones, United and Chelsea left-backs Luke Shaw and Ben Chilwell and the versatile Ben White of Arsenal are all expected to get the nod. There is far greater competition at right-back, with Kyle Walker of Manchester City, Liverpool star Trent Alexander-Arnold, Chelsea full-back Reece James and Newcastle new boy Kieran Trippier all competing for one starting berth. Outside of the established elite, Tyrone Mings’ value as a left-footed centre-half could see the Aston Villa man called upon. Conor Coady of Wolves, AC Milan centre-half Fikayo Tomori and Eric Dier and Joe Gomez of Tottenham and Liverpool respectively could figure if fortune favours them. Tariq Lamptey has caught the eye at Brighton, but faces fierce competition in his favoured defensive berth. Recognition may well come for the likes of Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi or Chelsea's Trevoh Chalobah as they continue their development. Player Selection odds Harry Maguire 1/20 John Stones 1/20 Ben Chilwell 1/16 Luke Shaw 1/12 Kyle Walker 1/8 Ben White 1/3 Trent Alexander-Arnold 1/3 Reece James 4/11 Kieran Trippier 7/4 Tyrone Mings 2/1 Conor Coady 2/1 Fikayo Tomori 3/1 Eric Dier 7/2 Joe Gomez 7/2 Marc Guehi 7/2 Trevoh Chalobah 7/2 Tariq Lamptey 4/1 Well… About time 😅 an absolute dream to score my first England goal 🦁 well done boys! Great performance! ❤️ pic.twitter.com/Ea10Hb4P9H There are another eight apparently obvious selections when it comes to midfield berths, with West Ham holding star Declan Rice, talented teenager Jude Bellingham of Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea playmaker Mason Mount and Manchester City youngster Phil Foden the shortest-priced of those. Jack Grealish, as the most expensive player in British football at Manchester City, is another almost guaranteed to secure a ticket, along with Bukayo Saka of Arsenal and Leeds United talisman Kalvin Phillips. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson will hope to have done enough to earn a call from Southgate, while Arsenal starlet Emile Smith Rowe has emerged as another useful creative influence. Conor Gallagher’s impressive loan spell at Crystal Palace has brought him into contention, while Jesse Lingard cannot be ruled out entirely despite struggling for minutes at Manchester United as he will drop into the free agent pool this summer and land himself a move elsewhere. James Maddison may be a key man at Leicester, but other playmakers are ahead of him on England’s depth chart, while the same can be said for Liverpool midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain – a man with 35 caps to his name. Dele Alli will need to produce something special during a loan spell at relegation-threatened Everton to work his way back into favour, while home-grown Chelsea star Ruben Loftus-Cheek is another to have fallen out of favour since figuring in England’s run to the last four at the 2018 World Cup. Player Selection odds Declan Rice 1/20 Jude Bellingham 1/20 Mason Mount 1/20 Phil Foden 1/20 Jack Grealish 1/16 Bukayo Saka 1/10 Jordan Henderson 1/3 Kalvin Phillips 1/3 Emile Smith Rowe Evens Conor Gallagher 7/4 James Ward-Prowse 11/4 Jesse Lingard 11/4 Curtis Jones 4/1 Harvey Barnes 4/1 Harvey Elliott 4/1 James Maddison 4/1 Oliver Skipp 4/1 Ruben Loftus-Cheek 5/1 Dele Alli 6/1 Jacob Ramsey 6/1 Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 10/1 ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️Harry Kane is now @England's joint-highest goalscorer in major tournaments (EUROs, #WorldCup), alongside @GaryLineker on 10 goals pic.twitter.com/8uyw6EBXbY Given that he is captain of the Three Lions and a man well on course to chase down Wayne Rooney’s all-time record goal haul for his country, it may come as a surprise to find that Tottenham striker Harry Kane is not top of the market when it comes to attacking calls. He will be involved, though, if untimely injuries are avoided, as will Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling and Manchester United star Marcus Rashford. Jadon Sancho has come back into form at Manchester United, giving him a shot at selection, while Dominic Calvert-Lewin will be hoping to do enough at Everton to prove that he can provide capable cover for Kane. Manchester United's Marcus Rashford remains highly regarded and is expected to make the plane, but his odds of inclusion may take a tumble if the dip in form, which saw him left out of England's March international panel, continues. Jarrod Bowen’s fine form at West Ham has made him flavour of the month, but he will need to maintain his current standards in order to secure a ticket to Qatar. Tammy Abraham has fared admirably in Italy with Roma, while Ollie Watkins remains a handful at Aston Villa, and they could be asked to provide back-up in a No.9 post. Callum Hudson-Odoi needs to be figuring more frequently for Chelsea in order to put himself into contention, Patrick Bamford and Callum Wilson have to shake off injury struggles at Leeds and Newcastle respectively, and Danny Ings must raise his game with Aston Villa in order to add to his three caps. There is little chance of Leicester’s Jamie Vardy being asked to step out of international retirement, but an attacking star may burst onto the scene out of nowhere and stage a late surge for selection within Southgate’s goalscoring ranks.

Greenwood has been out of the squad since January after the 20-year-old was arrested on suspicion of rape, assault and threats to kill. With Greenwood out of the team, Man Utd have relied mostly on 37-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo, with veteran Edinson Cavani and out-of-form Marcus Rashford struggling to provide the goals needed to ease the load on the Portuguese star's shoulders. ""We need at least two to give team more quality,"" Rangnick said. ""Modern strikers. ""Liverpool and Man City have five or six. Is Grealish a winger or striker? They are all strikers. ""We don’t have many. Mason Greenwood would have been but after West Ham he wasn't part of the squad."" Ronaldo has remained ever-present for the club, solidifying his spot as the team's top scorer with 24 goals in all competitions. Bruno Fernandes is second, having hit double-digits in the win over Brentford on Monday, with Greenwood still Man Utd's third-leading scorer this season despite being suspended for the second half of the season. Rashford sits fourth this season with five goals, level with winger Jadon Sancho. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-champions-league-final-henderson-mane-break-down/blt17e01f0bc4a305d9,Liverpool eyeing another Champions League final after Henderson & Mane break down Villarreal's 'Yellow Wall',"Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal: Match Statistics Two minutes and eight seconds. That was all it took to turn a sticky night into a spectacular one for Liverpool. They’re not there yet, but Jurgen Klopp’s side are now overwhelming favourites to reach their third Champions League final in five seasons, after seeing off Villarreal 2-0 in their semi-final, first leg at Anfield on Wednesday night. Quick-fire strikes from Jordan Henderson and Sadio Mane did the damage for the Reds, who, for 45 minutes, had looked as if they might find Villarreal’s ‘Yellow Wall’ as puzzling and as frustrating as Juventus and Bayern Munich had before them. Those two giants had fallen, but it would be a surprise if Liverpool were to go the same way now, even if they still have to finish the job in Spain next week. This was a convincing, dominant performance from Klopp’s men, who still have that unprecedented quadruple firmly within their sights. Unai Emery sent his side to annoy, but the gulf in quality between the two sides was evident throughout. Liverpool’s biggest annoyance, in fact, will be that they didn’t finish the tie here. They certainly had the chances to do so. That nutmeg assist from Mohamed Salah 😈 pic.twitter.com/gT0xK3luwS In the end, a two-goal cushion will do them. It came courtesy of a piece of good fortune, Henderson’s clipped cross from the right drifting over the head of Geronimo Rulli, the Villarreal goalkeeper, and into the net, and from a piece of elite attacking quality, Mo Salah finding the perfect pass for Mane, who found the perfect finish for 2-0. Emery’s side looked shell-shocked. They had conceded only two goals in four games against Juve and Bayern, but suddenly they had shipped two in the blink of an eye, Liverpool’s relentless intensity too much even for a team designed to, in the words of their manager, “suffer without the ball” for long periods. They certainly did that here. Liverpool had almost three-quarters possession, took 19 shots and forced 10 corners. Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk spent more time in the Villarreal half than in their own, while Alisson Becker was a spectator for the most part. Safe to say, it wasn’t the ding-dong we saw at the Etihad on Tuesday night. African players with the most Champions League knockout goals:Sadio Mane - 14 🇸🇳Didier Drogba - 14 🇨🇮 pic.twitter.com/kPz25Lg9mL The result, though, is what is important, and Liverpool will certainly be backed to finish the job in six days’ time, even if they must first negotiate a tricky Premier League trip to Newcastle on Saturday lunchtime. They had all the quality here, the tone set by Thiago Alcantara’s probing and Luis Diaz’s pressing. What a pair of signings those two are turning out to be, players of pedigree and desire and class. Throw in Mane, who again led the line superbly, and Salah, who didn’t score but created havoc with Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold on the right, and you have a potent combination. The night finished as it had started, with The Beatles playing on the Anfield PA system. It was ‘Yellow Submarine’ before kick-off, a nice touch given the opposition, but it was a different tune being belted out by the end. ‘I Feel Fine’ has become the soundtrack to Liverpool’s season, and no wonder. They're so glad, that Jurgen is a red, and come the end of next month, these fans, and this team, could have everything they ever dreamed of. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

Liverpool's quadruple bid off to perfect start with epic Carabao Cup victory","Match statistics: Chelsea 0-0 Liverpool (10-11 pens.) The day began with tears for the injured Thiago Alcantara, but there were only smiles at the end for Liverpool. The Carabao Cup trophy used to be a permanent fixture at Anfield, and it is back in the Reds’ possession once more. The first leg of a potential quadruple is in the bag, for Jurgen Klopp and his team. They and their fans went through hell to get there, mind. This will go down as one of the most incredible football matches - never mind finals - in living memory. Where do you even begin to unravel what we witnessed here today at Wembley? It took 120 minutes and 22 penalties to settle it. But when Kepa Arrizabalaga, the Chelsea goalkeeper, sent his spot-kick into orbit at around 7.20pm, Liverpool could finally celebrate. And boy did they. SCENES!!! 🤯Kepa Arrizabalaga misses the 22nd penalty after being subbed on for the shoot-out! 😨 pic.twitter.com/yLIOIQWdUD KEPA MISSED IT 🤯LIVERPOOL ARE CHAMPIONS 🏆 pic.twitter.com/zCcEccrgnQ Kepa had been brought specifically for the shootout, his job to save penalties rather than take them. But the Spain international, a specialist, could do nothing as, one by one, Liverpool’s stars held their nerve from 12 yards. Caoimhin Kelleher was the 11th Red to do so, burying his penalty with aplomb. What a day this was for the Irishman, the deputy for Alisson Becker who did not put a foot, or a hand, wrong throughout. Kepa’s miss sparked wild scenes. Red smoke filled the north London air as the pyrotechnics were unleashed. Klopp, his staff and his players sprinted to Kelleher, who celebrated in front of the Liverpool supporters as the Wembley DJ played ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’. Who says the Carabao Cup doesn’t matter, eh? There was nothing to separate the sides in the two league meetings earlier this year, and this was just as tight a contest, if not tighter. At times, it bordered on farcical. Chelsea had three goals disallowed and Liverpool one. VAR played its part, and so did the two goalkeepers. Kelleher made big saves from Christian Pulisic and Romelu Lukaku, while Edouard Mendy made an incredible one to deny Sadio Mane. The Senegal star was the Man Of The Match by a mile, and he was not even there for the conclusion. Chance after chance came and went. Mo Salah clean through, denied on the line by Thiago Silva. Mason Mount hit the post and missed another good opportunity. Mendy denied Virgil van Dijk and Luis Diaz. It was relentless, breathless, almost dangerously intense. Lord only knows what Klopp and Thomas Tuchel went through on the touchline. They embraced during the first half, and shared a nice moment when Kepa blazed his penalty over, but their heart-rate cannot have dropped below 130bpm here. And so Liverpool have ‘their’ trophy back. This is the ninth time they have lifted the League Cup, and only two of those have been settled in 90 minutes. They really are the marathon men in this competition, aren’t they? There is still plenty of running to do this season, mind. They enjoyed themselves here, but they know that there could be so much more to come. Manchester City are in their sights in the Premier League, and they will fancy their chances of going deep in both the Champions League and the FA Cup, too. That is for tomorrow, though. Today, it is time to celebrate. Klopp did. He danced a jig to Dua Lipa in front of his adoring fans. Kelleher could barely contain himself, Harvey Elliott grabbed a flare, the passion written all over his teenage face. James Milner, the oldest member of the squad, smiled like it was his first time. Joel Matip grinned and bounced, Van Dijk waved a corner flag around. It was carnage. A fitting climax, you could say. Liverpool Football Club are doing what they do. They are gathering cups again. One suspects there will be more to come this season, as well. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

A Portuguese superstar at Old Trafford has faced questions of his value to a collective cause in 2021-22, but has still plundered 23 goals to keep an inconsistent outfit in the hunt for European qualification. There have been suggestions that he will walk away from the final year of a lucrative contract once the current campaign comes to a close, but interim boss Rangnick – who will be sticking around as a consultant while also taking the reins of the Austria national team – is reluctant to be drawn on whether a five-time Ballon d’Or winner will still be a United player in 2022-23. When that question was put to Rangnick by Sky Sports ahead of a Premier League clash with Brentford, the German tactician said: “This is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag. “He's showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it's obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, it's pretty obvious.” Cristiano Ronaldo has scored eight of Manchester United’s last nine goals in the Premier League 🇵🇹 pic.twitter.com/SIg3HZulUk Rangick is yet to discuss Ronaldo with Ten Hag, with no talks of any kind having taken place between United’s head coaches of the present and future. Quizzed on whether he has spoken with a man seeing out the current campaign at Eredivisie title hopefuls Ajax, Rangnick said: “I'm pretty sure he's got my phone number! “He's got another couple of games to play with Ajax, we have another three games to play here. Whenever he wants to speak with me and exchange our opinions, I'm more than happy to do that.” Transfer plans need to be drawn up by United at some stage over the coming weeks, with it important that they do not leave themselves playing catch-up when another window swings open. Investment over recent years has delivered little return, as the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City have shown how it should be done, but Rangnick believes the gap to arch-rivals can be closed sooner than many people think. He has said of recruitment by the Red Devils: “If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window. “They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. “I wouldn't be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks. This shows it is possible that this can happen and it would not necessarily need three, four years in order to do that.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

The talented teenager, who has already broken into the full Argentina squad, made his Premier League bow off the bench in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Old Trafford – as he came on to partner Cristiano Ronaldo in attack during the close stages of that game. His intention is to see many more minutes over the coming years, as Erik ten Hag prepares to inherit first-team reins from Ralf Rangnick, but for now his focus is locked on catching the eye at youth level – with a prominent role played for United’s U18 side this season in their run to the FA Youth Cup final. Having stepped back down from the senior fold for now, Garnacho was among the goals on Sunday during a clash with Liverpool. Alejandro Garnacho's goal against Liverpool U23s pic.twitter.com/wC1qLy7LLl He figured against the Reds as part of a side that also included Alvaro Fernandez and Hannibal Mejbri, with United continuing to see highly-rated talent drop off a fabled conveyor belt. Garnacho’s strike against Liverpool further highlighted why he is held in such high regard, as he raced through on goal to finish with aplomb. The Red Devils would go on to lose the game 3-1, but that is all part of a steep learning curve for a Madrid-born youngster that is now rubbing shoulders with Ronaldo and Lionel Messi with club and country. Garnacho is understandably delighted at enjoying a breakthrough campaign in 2021-22 and has posted on social media: “Incredible moment making my debut at 17 years old for Manchester United in the Premier League at the Theatre of Dreams. “I can’t put into words what I’m feeling right now, I’ve been dreaming of this moment since I was 4 years old. “I would like to thank everyone at the club for giving me this opportunity, my family for always being there for me, my friends and all the fans for their constant support. The hard work continues in order to have more nights like these. And remember guys, Dreams really do come true.” Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/senegal-attack-salah-egypt-world-cup-play-off-replay/blt9064b2313f928ed7,Senegal 'attack' on Salah prompts Egypt to make extraordinary World Cup play-off replay request,"Senegal's ""attack"" on Mohamed Salah has prompted Egypt to make an extraordinary request to replay their World Cup qualification play-off. Egypt missed out on a place at Qatar 2022 after losing on penalties to Senegal in their play-off tie, just over a month after being beaten in the same fashion by the Lions in the Afcon final. However, the second leg was overshadowed by the actions of a number of the home supporters before, during and after the game, with Salah receiving the brunt of the abuse. Egypt's team bus was left with a smashed windscreen after fans threw objects at the vehicle before its arrival at Senegal's new 50,000 capacity stadium. Salah, meanwhile, was targeted by lasers from the stands as he stepped up to take his decisive penalty in the shootout, which he ultimately blazed over the bar. The Liverpool star was also pelted with objects while being escorted off the pitch by security and the Egyptian football association claimed that racist banners had been held up in a subsequent statement confirming that they had filed a complaint to FIFA. Gamal Allam, the head of the Egyptian FA, has now revealed that their complaint included a request to replay the match. ""Hani Abu Rida, Hassan Mustafa and the Egyptian officials in the African and International Federations must intervene to support the Egyptian team,"" Allam said, as quoted by Youm7 Sport. “I am on my way to Qatar to attend the FIFA Congress on Thursday afternoon. We asked to meet FIFA President Gianni Infantino as well as Patrice Motsepe, President of the Confederation of African Football. ""We asked for a replay of the match because the match was held in a strange atmosphere, and if we had lost in normal circumstances, we would have congratulated Senegal. ""We will present what happened to the disciplinary committee in the Federation and await a response. There are many things that happened with us in the match. Our players were attacked. ""Mohamed Salah had the most share of the Senegalese fans' attack on him, which tried to intimidate the players as well, and we asked that the board of directors be on the bench of the matchbut they refused."" Carlos Queiroz resigned as Egypt head coach after the game, but Allam says his future remains up in the air until a final decision is made on whether the result stands or not. ""If it is decided to replay the Senegal match, there will be no room to talk about Queiroz's position until the match ends,and we will resolve his position if the match is not repeated,"" the Egypt chief added.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/will-egypt-algeria-granted-world-cup-play-off-replays-fifa/blt6b03c5e947497808,Will Egypt & Algeria be granted World Cup play-off replays? Reasons for FIFA requests explained,"When the final five places available to African nations at World Cup 2022 were dished out, Egypt and Algeria were among those to be left empty-handed. Both had made their way to the CAF play-offs, but suffered painful setbacks in two-legged encounters to leave them among those being forced to watch on from afar when the global showpiece heads to Qatar. Neither country is accepting their fate without a fight, though, with both lodging appeals to FIFA in which replays of their most recent fixtures are being demanded. Why is that the case and what will happen next? GOAL takes a look… Egypt were the first to lodge an official complaint with FIFA after suffering more penalty shootout pain against Senegal – with that setback coming on the back of an Africa Cup of Nations final defeat to the same opponents. The Pharaohs had entered the second leg of a heavyweight encounter holding a narrow 1-0 lead, but conceded a fourth-minute own goal of the tie as the contest eventually went all the way to spot-kicks. Liverpool superstar Mohamed Salah had several lasers aimed at his face when preparing to step up from 12 yards – with his effort eventually sailing high over the crossbar – while Egypt’s team bus was attacked prior to the game and racist banners were displayed inside and outside of the stadium. A statement from the Egyptian FA read: “The Egyptian Football Association have lodged a formal complaint against its Senegalese counterpart to the match observer, the security official, CAF, and FIFA, before the start of the match between the two teams. “The Egyptian team was subjected to racism after the appearance of offensive banners in the stands aimed at the players, specifically Mohamed Salah. “Moreover, the Senegalese fans terrorised the Egyptian players by throwing bottles and stones at them during the warm-up, as well as attacking the Egyptian team bus, which caused glass shattering and some injuries, which was documented with pictures and videos attached to the complaint.” On the same evening, Algeria also missed out on qualification for World Cup 2022 by the narrowest of margins. They had also led into the second leg of their clash with Cameroon, but saw Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting restore parity before Islam Slimani had two goals disallowed. Ahmed Touba thought he had booked tickets to Qatar when netting in extra-time, but Karl Toko-Ekambi found the target in the fourth minute of stoppage-time to send the Indomitable Lions through. Samuel Eto'o's reaction after Cameroon qualified for the World Cup in the 124th minute 🇨🇲😍 pic.twitter.com/tNB4ghymMJ Algeria were also left feeling wronged, particularly by the match officials on display, and sent an appeal of their own to world football’s governing body. Their statement read: “FAF officially lodges an appeal with FIFA against the scandalous arbitration which distorted the result of the match. “We are determined to use all the legally permitted votes to have their rights restored and to replay the match under conditions guaranteeing the honesty and partiality of the arbitration.” Egypt and Algeria are yet to receive an official response to their appeals, with FIFA still mulling things over. It is expected that definitive decisions will be made by the end of April, with everybody needing to know where they stand. The draw for the finals in Qatar has already been made, with group-stage fixtures being lined up. Senegal are due to face the host nation, Ecuador and the Netherlands in their section, while Cameroon have been pooled with Brazil, Switzerland and Serbia. No Mohamed Salah at the 2022 World Cup 😩 pic.twitter.com/DRVQcnFfkk If no alterations are made to that schedule, then the likes of Salah – who is already 29 years of age – will have to wait until the World Cup heads to North and Central America in 2026 for their next opportunity to rub shoulders with the global elite.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-salah-hints-retirement-international-football/blt845480dc67aec6fa,Liverpool star Salah hints at retirement from international football with Egypt,"Liverpool star Mohamed Salah has hinted he may be ready to retire from international football following World Cup heartbreak against Senegal, while Egypt have requested the match be replayed. Salah missed a penalty in Tuesday's shoot-out as his nation missed out on a place in Qatar, having drawn 1-1 on aggregate over the two legs of the qualifier. Now, at the age of 29, he seems to be having doubts over whether to return to duty for the Pharaohs. Salah was caught on video in the Egypt dressing room speaking in frank terms with his team-mates. “I told the players before the second match that I am proud to play with them and they are among the best I have played with,"" he explained. “I played for some time with the previous generation, with Wael Gomaa and Mohamed Abu Trika, then Abdullah Al-Saeed and his generation, but I'm happy with the current generation. “I am proud to play with you and it was an honour for me, and what happened cannot be interfered with by anyone because for the second time it is a penalty shootout (after the AFCON final). ""There is not much I can say but it has been an honour to play with you, whether I will be in the national team after that or not."" Egyptian Minister of Sports, Ashraf Sobhi, however, interrupted him, saying: ""You will be there."" The game against Senegal, that saw Salah miss a penalty in the shoot-out, was marred with controversy, with Egypt having since requested the game be replayed citing racism and abuse from the crowd. Salah in particular was targeted, with lasers having been shone in his face before he blazed his penalty over the bar, while he had to be protected by security staff as missiles were pelted in his direction as he attempted to leave the pitch after the game. While Salah's international future may be up in the air, he remains a hero both for Egypt and in Liverpool, where a new mural was unveiled for the star.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/egypt-salah-wants-to-stay-at-liverpool-despite-sobhi-s-plea/blt8e505cb699e382e6,Egypt’s Salah 'wants to stay at Liverpool' despite Sobhi's plea,"Egypt Sports Minister Ashraf Sobhi has claimed Mohamed Salah is keen to extend his stay at Liverpool despite his request the Reds forward gets a new team. The 29-year-old is yet to renew his contract with the Reds but his agent is currently negotiating with the club to have him stay at Anfield, with a big-money four-year deal rumoured to be on offer. Sobhi has revealed he personally told Salah, whose deal at the club is set to expire in 2023, to leave Liverpool after Egypt’s defeat to Senegal in their 2022 World Cup play-off. “I met with Mohamed Salah at the airport after the end of the Senegal match and the failure to reach the World Cup finals and said to him to forget what happened and focus on what’s next,” Sobhi told Egyptian radio on Monday as quoted by The Metro. “I have advised him to continue his journey at a club other than Liverpool, but his direction now is to renew his contract with Liverpool. ""There are campaigns against Salah directed by some to bring him down, but I asked him not to pay attention to them.” Ahead of Liverpool's Champions League away clash against Benfica on Tuesday, manager Jurgen Klopp said Salah’s representatives are currently locked in negotiations with the club regarding his contract. “I am happy because there is nothing new to say, it is good. The decisive parties are talking to each other and that is all I need,” Klopp told reporters. On Salah’s form, which has seen him not score from open play since the  3-1 win over relegation-threatened Norwich City, Klopp said: “He [Salah] might not have scored in open play, I don’t know that is not important, for me his performance level is important, how he brings players together, when he gets the ball two or three players come to him, he could make better decisions but it is a tough gig, Africa for him and Sadio [Mane], but it is completely normal in a season. “We see him every day in training and it is nothing to worry about. These players will not come to me and ask for a break so I have to pick the moment.” While Salah has so far in this season managed 20 Premier League goals from 28 appearances, he has also notched eight goals in the Champions League campaign.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/vinicius-tobias-real-madrid-teenage-signing-brazil-alexander/blt851cb664e4627f8e,Vinicius Tobias: Real Madrid's new teenage signing could be Brazil's answer to Alexander-Arnold,"Dani Alves, Cafu, Carlos Alberto - when it comes to producing top-quality right-backs, few do it better than Brazil. The well, however, has run dry in recent years, so much so that despite being less than a month away from his 39th birthday, Alves is expected to be the Selecao's starter in the position for the 2022 World Cup. Quite who steps into the Barcelona star's shoes when he eventually hangs up his boots is anyone's guess right now, but there is hope that in a few years, the next top Brazilian right-back will be ready to pull on that famous yellow shirt. The player in question is Vinicius Tobias, who has been raising eyebrows for a number of years in his homeland, having come through the ranks at Internacional. The 18-year-old, who on April 1 completed a move to Real Madrid, appeared on the radars of Brazilian fans after helping the country's Under-15s win the South American Championship in 2019, with Vinicius scoring in the final victory over Argentina. He has since been likened to Trent Alexander-Arnold, in part because, like the Liverpool star, he started life as a central midfielder who has since been moved to the flank, but has been able to retain his playmaking abilities. Madrid are in desperate need of such a player within their first team, with Dani Carvajal having been exposed at times this season, particularly in the Champions League, while versatile duo Nacho and Lucas Vazquez are not natural right-backs despite having both filled in when Carvajal has been absent. There are high hopes at Madrid for 16-year-old Alejandro Jimenez, who is already a regular in the Blancos' U19s side, but with Bayern Munich sniffing around the Spain youth international, Vinicius has a real chance to nail down a starting role at Santiago Bernabeu for years to come. His road to the Spanish capital has, however, not been an easy one. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: At the age of just 12, Vinicius was forced to leave his mother's home in Sao Paulo and move over 1,100 kilometres (685 miles) south along Brazil's eastern coast to Porto Alegre, where he had been enrolled into Internacional's academy. He caught the eye of the club's scouts with his ability to take on opponents and drive into the penalty area from central midfield, as well as his vision of the game and tendency to always find team-mates with his passes. ""I was signed as a forward, but by 2017, I was playing as a midfielder,"" Vinicius told GloboEsporte when relaying the tale of his transition to right-back. ""Our full-back, Gustavo Bagatini, was injured and we didn't have another one. I asked the coach, Lucas Marchetti, for the chance to play there. It wasn't very difficult, but I still had a lot to learn."" Vinicius learned quickly, and he has never looked back, crowning his time at Internacional by helping the club win the Brazilian U20 Championship in 2021. “He is the typical Brazilian player, an athlete with technical abilities of a very high level,"" Joao Miguel, who coached Vinicius to that title, tells GOAL. ""The relationship between the ball and and him is great, while the ability he has to solve the problems of the game is also very high, as well as his understanding of the tactical issues of the game. “His physical attributes are very good, too, and he has good mental strength. He is a player who likes a duel and who enjoys the challenges of the game. ""So it is with huge happiness that he is already making his way abroad, where he will shine thanks to all of these skills."" Those skills led to interest from a number of top European clubs in Vinicius, with Real Madrid joined by Bayern Munich, Juventus and Atletico Madrid in monitoring the progress of the teenager. However, the race to sign Vinicius was won by Shakhtar Donetsk, who announced in July 2021 that they had agreed a €6 million (£5m/$7m) deal to bring the defender to Ukraine, with Vinicius set to arrive six months later. He left Internacional without ever having played a first-team match for his boyhood club, but he was instantly integrated into the Shakhtar senior squad, with whom he spent their mid-season training camp in Turkey, appearing in six friendlies. Those games look likely to be his only appearances for the club, however, with Vinicius one of a group of Brazilian players based in Ukraine who took to social media upon Russia's invasion of the country in a bid to find safe passage out of their adopted home. After a number of days, the youngster joined his compatriots in crossing the border out of Ukraine, before it was announced by FIFA that players from Ukrainian clubs would be allowed to move outside of the transfer window so as to further their careers. Aware of him from their previous interest, Madrid moved quickly to secure Vinicius' signature, signing him on an initial loan through to the end of the 2022-23 season, with the option to make the deal permanent for €17m (£14m/$18m) included. Though he has been through a lot since his arrival in Europe, Vinicius has settled well in Spain, and recently debuted for Real Madrid Castilla in the third tier of Spanish football. He has also trained with the first-team squad, though he is ineligible to play for them this season due to there already being three non-European Union players - Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and Eder Militao - who play regularly in Carlo Ancelotti's side. Vinicius' time to step onto the Liga stage will come, however, even if he has to wait for his chance. It is something he is getting used to doing, but there is a belief that once he arrives into top-level football, he is unlikely to depart anytime soon. Brazil's long history of producing the world's top right-backs looks likely to continue. Additional reporting by Jorge Castro Picon.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/fabio-miretti-juventus-wonderkid-italian-de-bruyne/blt382083c5ac6e8ad8,Fabio Miretti: Juventus wonderkid aiming to become 'The Italian De Bruyne',"Italian football is in a strange place right now. Internationally, they boast the champions of Europe, but are still coming to terms with the Azzurri missing out on a second successive World Cup. At club level, meanwhile, Italy boast one of, if not the most competitive of Europe's top five leagues, but have had just one team – Atalanta – reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League in the past three seasons. Fans around the country, therefore, are hopeful that a new generation of Italian footballers can help lead both the national team and its most historic clubs back to the top of the world game. Though using youth football results as a means of predicting the future is a dangerous game, there have been some encouraging signs so far in 2022. Italy qualified with ease for the upcoming Under-19s European Championship, and will be considered one of the favourites to win the competition in Slovakia when it kicks-off in mid-June. Juventus, meanwhile, have become just the second Italian side to reach the semi-finals of the UEFA Youth League since its inception in 2013, and will face Benfica in Nyon on Friday for a place in the final. And one player at the heart of both those sides around whom there is plenty of excitement is midfielder Fabio Miretti. The 18-year-old has been with the Bianconeri for 11 years, and having made his first-team debut already this season, there is genuine belief that Miretti can go on to become a star at the Allianz Stadium. It was he who scored the opening goal for Juve as they beat Liverpool 2-0 in the Youth League quarter-finals, while he also netted in two of Italy's three elite-round qualifying matches to earn their spot at the Euros. Such decisive actions suggest he already has the mentality to succeed, and follow in the footsteps of his footballing idol, Kevin De Bruyne. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: ""What impresses me is his technique, but also his vision,"" Miretti told Tuttosport when discussing the Manchester City star. ""He always knows where to pass the ball. He is a champion, a complete midfielder in every aspect."" Miretti certainly displays plenty of those same traits in his own game, with the teenager most comfortable playing as a No.8 in either a midfield three or diamond formation. Can @JuventusFCYouth produce more of these slick moves in Friday's semi-final with Benfica?Watch #UYL action on https://t.co/9QkhwHwkXF 📺 ""Miretti has enormous football intelligence, excellent technical qualities and has grown a lot in how he covers the field, in terms of both intensity and stamina,"" Juventus U19s manager, Andrea Bonatti, told Tuttosport. ""He has creativity, goals and is a positive influence in the dressing room. He feels the pleasure of contributing towards his team-mates scoring and winning."" Miretti joined Juventus in 2011 after being spotted playing for Cuneo, around 60 kilometres (37 miles) away from Turin. Torino were also keen on enrolling the youngster into their academy, but Miretti – who once refused to cut his blonde hair as a boy so he could look more like his hero, Pavel Nedved – chose Juve over their city rivals. Working his way through the various age-group sides, he began to appear on the radar of the Old Lady's more die-hard supporters as a 16-year-old, when he scored 16 goals and laid on six assists in 17 games for Juve's U17s side in 2019-20. He has since gone onto captain the Primavera (U19s) side while appearing regularly for Juventus U23s, who play in the third tier of Italian football. So far this season, he has three goals and four assists in Serie C. Having first caught the eye of Massimiliano Allegri during pre-season, Miretti made his first-team debut in December, when he came off the bench for the final minutes of Juve's Champions League win over Malmo. He followed that up with a Serie A debut in March, and it is expected that he will earn more chances in the final weeks of the season as Weston McKennie, Denis Zakaria and Arthur Melo spend time on the sidelines nursing injuries. Capable of playing any midfield role, Miretti has been taking advice from Manuel Locatelli when training as part of the senior squad, and there is hope that the pair will one day be the key pieces in the Juventus engine room. Miretti's commitment to his boyhood club was confirmed in January when he signed a new contract that will keep him with Juventus until 2026, in turn ending the hopes of clubs in the Bundesliga, Premier League and Ligue 1 of signing him as interest began to ramp up. Other Serie A clubs have also reached out to Juve to enquire about Miretti's potential availability, but the 36-time Italian champions are not yet ready to let one of their academy's prized assets leave, either on loan or permanently. Instead, they are hopeful that he can lead them to Youth League glory in the coming days, which in turn could be the catalyst for a new generation of Italian stars to emerge at the very top of the game.

Conor McGregor, Nick Candy & candidates for Abramovich to sell Blues to","Roman Abramovich may have seen his assets frozen by the UK government due to connections with Russian president Vladimir Putin, but Chelsea remain up for sale and a takeover could still go through if the right licenses and guarantees are obtained. With that in mind, a race to secure ownership of Premier League heavyweights - and the current holders of a prestigious Champions League crown - is on, with multi-billion pound bids now in the pipeline. A number of potential stakeholders at Stamford Bridge have emerged as interest builds steadily, from UFC superstars to wealthy supporters of the west London club, but who are those in the running? GOAL takes a look... An avid Chelsea supporter, billionaire property developer Candy has been talking to a group of American investors about forming a consortium to buy the Blues. His £2.5bn ($3.3bn) proposal is said to include plans for a £1.5bn ($2bn) rebuild of Stamford Bridge, while the 49-year-old – who is married to former Neighbours actress Holly Valance – has made it clear that he would look to put fellow fans at the heart of his regime. Candy has told Sky Sports of the reasons for his interest: ""I’ve supported Chelsea since the age of four. My dad was asked to play for Chelsea. I love Chelsea. ""I don’t mind where it ends up, even if it is not with me, as long as it is in safe hands."" The 86-year-old emerged as an early frontrunner after revealing long before Abramovich formally put Chelsea up for sale that he had been offered the chance to invest in the club alongside three other parties. The Swiss – who is said to be worth £4.3bn ($5.6bn) after founding American medical device business Synthes – has claimed that Abramovich will need to lower his asking price in order for a deal to go through. He has said: “Abramovich is currently asking far too much. You know, Chelsea owe him £2 billion. But Chelsea has no money. That means, those who buy Chelsea should compensate Abramovich. “As of today, we don't know the exact selling price. I can well imagine starting at Chelsea with partners. But I have to examine the general conditions first. But what I can already say, I'm definitely not doing something like this alone. If I buy Chelsea, then with a consortium consisting of six to seven investors.” The U.S. tycoon is one of those said to be interested in entering into a partnership with Wyss. The co-founder, chairman and CEO of Eldridge Industries, who has a net worth of £4.72bn ($6.1bn), had two bids for Chelsea knocked back in 2019 and is a huge sports fan after already acquiring stakes in MLB side the Los Angeles Dodgers and NBA heavyweights the LA Lakers. One of the more surprising candidates to have thrown his hat into the ring, the Irish MMA fighter saw his interest piqued once it was announced that Abramovich was looking for a buyer. He tweeted “I wish to explore this, Chelsea” when responding to WhatsApp message in which a contact said: “Chelsea for sale, £3bn. Let's buy it.” McGregor is famously a supporter of Manchester United and has previously expressed interest in wrestling control of the Red Devils from the Glazer family. He has also said that he is interested in getting involved with Scottish Premiership team Celtic. A Turkish businessman that made his £8bn ($10bn) fortune as chairman of AB Group Holding – a company which invests in tourism, cryptocurrency and construction – Bayrak is said to have met with Abramovich to discuss a possible deal. He has, however, cast doubt over whether he would be welcomed to west London, saying: “I think they don't want Turkey to buy the club. Everyone should know that the Republic of Turkey is a very big state. Very serious business people come out of this state, and we exist and will be all over the world.” GOAL has been able to confirm that Broughton has held discussions about playing a role in bids that are being prepared for Chelsea. He was previously involved in the deal that saw Fenway Sports Group bring the disastrous reign of Tom Hicks and George Gillett at Liverpool to an end in 2010. Broughton, who is a former chairman of British Airways, is negotiating with backers about tabling his own offer, although he faces a race against time to generate the funds required to enter the bidding. Another fanatical Chelsea supporter that harbours dreams of taking control of the club he loves. Reuben’s father and uncle – who form part of a £12bn ($15.6bn) business - bought a 10 per cent stake in Newcastle last year when a £300m ($391m) takeover at St James’ Park was completed, but he could head out on his own. A man that boasts the likes of Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton and Boris Johnson among his friendship group could find it difficult to get a green light from the Premier League, though, due to his family ties with top-flight rivals on Tyneside. Another of the bidders to have a redevelopment of Stamford Bridge within their grand plans for Chelsea. An approach from the Middle East is being spearheaded by Mohamed Alkhereiji, who runs Saudi Media and is CEO of the Engineer Holding Group parent company which was founded by his father Abdulelah Alkhereiji. The company turns over more than £1bn ($1.3bn) a year, while Alkhereiji is a Blues supporter and was in attendance during Abramovich’s last visit to Stamford Bridge in November 2021. Despite being a lifelong Manchester United supporter, a man with a £20bn ($26bn) fortune has been a season ticket holder at Chelsea for several years. Ratcliffe – who runs multi-national chemicals company Ineos - is the owner of French side Lille and has admitted to holding talks regarding a deal for the Blues. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: “There was some early exchange but we were a significant way apart on valuations. “The issue with Chelsea is its stadium. We are all getting older and it is a decade of your life to resolve that.” Among the others to have been linked with Chelsea are New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, while there has been talk of Moneyball mogul Billy Beane forming part of a bidding consortium. Jayed Afridi, who owns an automobile company and is CEO of consumer electrics giants Haier Pakistan, has been mooted as another potential bidder, along with Michael Rubin – the owner of sports merchandise group Fanatics, a company worth over £20bn ($26bn). Abramovich is said to have acquired Chelsea for just £140m ($182m) back in 2003, with the club enduring serious financial difficulties at that time. He has pumped considerable funding into the club over the course of a 19-year tenure and said investment has allowed 21 trophies to be secured – with that haul including five Premier League titles and two Champions League crowns. The Russian billionaire was said to have put a £3bn ($4bn) asking price on Chelsea when looking to sell, but questions have been asked of that valuation and he is no longer allowed to profit from any agreement after being sanctioned by the UK government. Anyone looking to do a deal, as the Blues work their way through a testing period off the field, must have best and final offers on the table at Stamford Bridge by Friday March 18.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/chiesa-injury-nightmare-juventus-transfer-problems/blt18c24820bd46d0fd,Chiesa injury adds to Juventus' transfer problems ahead of daunting Supercoppa showdown with Inter,"Three days on and it is still hard to know exactly what to make of Juventus' insane 4-3 victory at Roma, certainly from the visitors' perspective. Was it an anomaly or a turning point? The Bianconeri are still buzzing, of course. As captain Giorgio Chiellini admitted on Tuesday, it was the kind of win that ""gives you an adrenaline boost"". Marco Landucci had been on the Juventus bench in Rome and Allegri, who was forced to sit in the stands through suspension, was full of praise for his assistant coach, quipping on the eve of Wednesday's Supercoppa Italian showdown with Inter, ""He did really well. In fact, I thought about not turning up tomorrow!"" Landucci, though, will be happy to have his boss back alongside him in the dugout, having admitted that he ""lost five or six years of my life"" watching Juve come from 3-1 down to triumph at the Olimpico, despite the late concession of a penalty and loss of Matthijs de Ligt to a red card. Juve are now unbeaten in seven Serie A games and sit fifth in the standings, just three points behind Atalanta, though the fourth-placed Bergamaschi have played one game fewer. On the face of it, then, the Old Lady seems to have fully recovered from a shocking start to the season and is now perfectly primed to force her way back into the Champions League places. Doubts persist, though. After all, sometimes results can be misleading. Juventus have performed poorly for the majority of the season, and they had only scored 28 times in 20 matches going into Sunday's game. It must also be acknowledged that they were dire for more than an hour at the Stadio Olimpico. Allegri's introduction of Arthur and Alvaro Morata undoubtedly changed the game, and he undeniably deserves credit for his double substitution. Of course, his critics – and their numbers are increasing – would argue that the coach's conservatism has been responsible for Juve's poor productivity this term. They now hope that Allegri will see the benefits of playing Arthur in midfield alongside Manuel Locatelli and will abandon the 4-4-2 formation they deem embarrassingly outdated. Nobody is quite sure how the Tuscan will line his players up against Inter, though – not least because he will have to make do without some key men. Neither Alex Sandro nor Leonardo Bonucci are 100 per cent match fit, Danilo is injured, Juan Cuadrado and De Ligt are both suspended, while Wojciech Szczesny has not yet secured his Covid-19 Green Pass. Of greater significance, though, is the absence of Federico Chiesa. “Forza Federico”💪@GoalItalia pic.twitter.com/9jpYyxhNOl The Euro 2020 star suffered knee ligament damage in the first half of the Roma win and it has since been confirmed that his campaign is over. It is, as Chiellini pointed out, a devastating blow for not just Juve, but Italian football in general, with the winger now also ruled out of March's crucial World Cup play-offs. Even if the Azzurri were to make it to Qatar, there is no guarantee that Chiesa will be fit to feature there either. It is also unclear how Juve will react to his lengthy lay-off. At the very least, it is going to affect their January transfer plans, which were already shrouded in uncertainty because of Paulo Dybala, who was all set to sign an extension beyond the summer but is now set to be offered a new contract worth less than the €10 million (£8.3m/$11.3m) deal he had previously agreed with the club. As previously reported by GOAL, the Bianconeri are desperate to bring in a centre-forward and a central midfielder during the winter window, but they are being severely hampered by their financial issues. Consequently, the hope was that they could raise funds by cashing in on one of their few valuable assets deemed surplus to requirements by Allegri. Dejan Kulusevski was the most likely departure, given he has plenty of admirers in England. However, the versatile Sweden attacker is now the most obvious internal replacement for Chiesa. Allegri has, thus far, demonstrated a distinct lack of faith in Kulusevski, but even if he were to deem Federico Bernardeschi or Cuadrado better options out wide, it still seems unlikely that he would now sanction Kulusevski's sale. ""I talked to him [on Monday],"" Allegri revealed on the eve of the Supercoppa. ""He has great qualities and he can cover various roles. He's starting to understand Juve, as everyone needs to make a jump in quality on a mental level. ""Determination can change a player's career. It's also important that he finds the maturity required for playing certain games."" At the very least, Kulusevski's versatility should ensure he remains in Turin until the summer at least. Consequently, the chances of U.S. men's national team star Weston McKennie being sacrificed in January have risen, particularly with Juve trying to figure out a way to bring in Bruno Guimaraes from Lyon, who want €45m (£36m/$51m) for the Brazilian. The Bianconeri don't have the cash to make that deal happen right now but they could at least make space in their squad – and lower their wage bill in the process – by offloading Arthur, whom Arsenal are interested in taking on loan. Juve's priority, though, remains a centre-forward. Morata made a big impact at Roma, and Allegri insists the Spain striker is staying put despite agreeing personal terms with Barcelona, but Juve have no intention of taking up their option to buy the 29-year-old from Atletico Madrid at the end of the season. Their top target remains Gianluca Scamacca, but the Old Lady is simply not in a position to meet Sassuolo's €40m (£33m/$45m) asking price, and there is no chance of the Neroverdi letting the striker leave on loan midway through the season. It is a similar story with Mauro Icardi. Paris Saint-Germain want either a permanent deal or an obligation to buy inserted into any temporary transfer of the ex-Inter captain. Liverpool super-sub Divock Origi and Manchester United's frustrated French forward Anthony Martial have also been repeatedly mentioned but, again, neither player is expected to leave on loan without at least some money being paid up front. The most likely outcome is a short-term solution, with Sky Sport Italia claiming that the Bianconeri have made contact with Zenit about signing Sardar Azmoun, who is out of contract at the end of the season. Allegri, for his part, insists that the squad will remain unchanged between now and the end of the month. He is merely focused on maintaining the momentum built up over the past six weeks by winning the first trophy of his second spell in Turin. ""We need to think game by game in order to reach those ahead of us [in the table],"" Allegri argued in his pre-match press conference, ""and next season we will see if we have done enough to get back fighting for the Scudetto."" Beating Inter will not be easy of course. The reigning Serie A champions and current league leaders are almost everything that Juve are not right now: prolific, solid and 100 per cent sure of themselves. Allegri himself acknowledges Inter are the strongest team in Italy, while Chiellini says he knew as far back as September that the title was theirs to lose. Juve, then, could be in for a long evening. But, at the very least, the Supercoppa should shed far more light on how much work the Old Lady has to do to get back to the summit of Serie A than last Sunday’s insanity at Stadio Olimpico.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/worlds-best-right-back-james-chelsea-champions-league/bltf2a1978fbe296900,The world's best right-back? James confirming his status as a Chelsea - and Champions League - superstar,"Reece James and the Champions League are striking up a special relationship, even if there have been some bumps along the way. He enjoyed one of his early breakout moments in the Chelsea team when he netted the equaliser for the Blues in their memorable 4-4 draw with Ajax in 2019, though what followed in Europe that season he would sooner forget. A 7-1 aggregate loss to Bayern Munich was humbling for James, who was run ragged by an emerging Alphonso Davies, highlighting the size of the step up he was needing to take having spent the previous season on loan in the Championship at Wigan Athletic. Fast-forward 12 months, and having been guided by Thomas Tuchel, James was lifting the European Cup in Porto having been one of the outstanding performers in Chelsea's win over Manchester City. Targeted by Pep Guardiola, James put in a supreme defensive display, highlighting the fact that he is more than just an attacking full-back who struggles when closer to his own goal. That is not to say that his attacking output has diminished, and on Tuesday he again showed himself to be a constant threat in the final third as he helped put Juventus to the sword at Stamford Bridge. The Champions League is the stage for the world's best players, and right now it is difficult to find anyone in better form or who is more well-rounded than James as a right-back. Reece James is an absolute joke! 🤭Another outstanding finish from the Chelsea star! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/iUdgv2XI8A REECE JAMES. 💥CHELSEA'S DEFENDERS HAVE NOW SCORED 16 GOALS THIS SEASON. UNREAL. 😳 pic.twitter.com/bKVZorYYES His arrowed strike across Wojciech Szczesny for Chelsea's second in their 4-0 win over the Bianconeri means he is now the Blues' outright top scorer this season with five goals, moving him ahead of £97.5 million ($136m) summer signing Romelu Lukaku, who has four. James also has five assists to his name, with there only one other Premier League player with at least five goals and five assists in all competitions so far in 2021-22: Mohamed Salah. The England international also played his part in the third goal of the night, showing deft control in box in the build-up to Callum Hudson-Odoi firing home, as well as the fourth, as his sensational cross-field ball helped create Timo Werner's stoppage-time strike. There will be staunch opposition to the take that James is the best right-back in the world on current form from Liverpool supporters who back Trent Alexander-Arnold, and there are certainly arguments that can be made for both players. But James' superior defensive abilities, as well his new-found eye for goal just gives him the edge, and that is an opinion that Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate seems to share if his selections over the past 12 months are been anything to go by. Despite all that, Tuchel was cautious to name James as the best in the world in his position when asked by GOAL during Monday's press conference, perhaps in a bid to keep the 21-year-old focused on getting even better. ""Right now he plays as a wing-back, and he does this at a very high level,"" the German coach said. ""I see no reason why we should get carried away by things like if he is the best in the world or the best in England or the best in Europe. ""If he plays, he needs to be the best version of himself. He is improving, he takes responsibility and it is needed. ""He is far from finished in his development. He is super young. He has all the potential to be a big and important player for Chelsea and he is on his way. ""I feel he is dedicated and hungry for more, and that is what we want."" James himself is a man of few words, but when asked by GOAL about his current form during the recent international break, he said: ""I would say this is the best that I have ever performed. Recent results and performances have shown that as well."" Before he met Tuchel, James was already an exceptional talent. He was the captain of Jody Morris' FA Youth Cup-winning team in 2018, and won the club's Academy Player of the Year award in the process. He followed that up by being nominated for EFL Team of the Season in his first year as a professional at Wigan, but he remained a rough diamond. Tuchel has polished that diamond, accentuating his physical and ball-striking gifts by simplifying James' game with clear instructions about what he can and cannot do in his system. It led to a baptism of fire for James last season, where he was in and out of the team, facing the brunt of Tuchel's tirades from the touchline. But along with his tactical improvements, he has added more mobility to his game, allowing him to be in positions to score more often, and turning him the complete wing-back. The world's best? Right now, it is difficult to argue against it. Copyright © 2022 Goal (English) All rights reserved.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/pepe-s-future-at-arsenal-questioned-after-failing-to-break/blta87e73eb55f00ab8,Pepe's future at Arsenal questioned after failing to break into Arteta's Premier League first XI for six months,"Former Arsenal striker Kevin Campbell has opined winger Nicolas Pepe has no future at the club and should consider leaving. The 26-year-old Ivory Coast international was a purchase for former Gunners manager Unai Emery in 2019. However, he has arguably not shown the value of the over £70 million the North London team paid French outfit Lille for his services.  The attacker has not started a Premier League match for the club in the last six months, and despite the Gunners playing 34 matches already, Pepe has featured just 17 times.  It has been rumoured that Mikel Arteta is willing to let him go at the end of the ongoing campaign despite the player having a contract that runs until June 2024.  ""It has just not worked out. It is that simple. He is a talented player, that’s for sure. But it has not worked out for him,"" Campbell told Football Insider.  ""You see the intensity and focus that Mikel Arteta wants the team to play with. I don’t think Pepe fits into that. He is a drifter. He will concentrate for a bit and then drift out again.  ""I said just before Christmas it was a big few months coming up for Pepe. It was going to determine whether or not he had a future at Arsenal. Well, he doesn’t have a future at Arsenal.""  Arsenal are favourites to finish in the Champions League places this season after a much-improved campaign.  They are currently placed fourth on the table with 63 points from the 34 games they have played. However, they are facing stiff competition from North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur who are a position lower with 61 points.  Spurs have a tricky fixture away to Liverpool this weekend before hosting Arsenal in the London Derby.

The English side have a two-goal advantage after the first leg at Anfield and will be targeting a favourable result to make it to the final.  Keita has already featured in eight matches in the competition this season, scoring one goal in the process. Last weekend, the Guinea midfielder scored the only goal of the match to hand his team maximum points in the Premier League away to Newcastle.  The German tactician is happy with the 27-year-old's form ahead of the game away to the Yellow Submarine.  ""Long may that [form] continue because that is crucial, that is key to everything,"" Klopp said in a presser ahead of Tuesday's game.  ""If you have the talent and the skill set of Naby Keita and you are not fit, then nobody sees it, that’s how it is. If you then come back not in the best possible shape, all these kinds of things, that’s normal physically.  ""The player was never in doubt, not for a second, because he’s outstanding. It’s good he is now available. It’s a good option, a very good option to have. Played at the weekend was obviously a really good game, so we’ll see how long we will use him tomorrow. A very good option.""  The German tactician insists he has an exceptional squad but went on to state that his team will also need luck to make it to the final.  ""You never know if you will reach a semi-final again if we ever have a chance again to go to the final – you never know,"" Klopp continued.  ""We have an exceptional team here and nothing is [taken] for granted, you need luck in these moments, all these kind of things, so you better treat it carefully and be ready – but we will.  ""We will be ready. We really wanted to be where we are and we want to go to the final. But if Villarreal is better than us and beats us with a result which qualifies them for the final, then congratulations and that's it. ""But between now and then, 95 or whoever knows how many minutes to play. I'm looking forward to it.""  After winning the League Cup, the Reds are chasing the Premier League, the FA Cup and the Champions League titles.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/laporte-man-city-liverpool-premier-league-title-race/bltf884e19e7bf48edf,Laporte: Of course Man City are watching Liverpool games and results in Premier League title race,"Aymeric Laporte admits Manchester City are keeping a close eye on Liverpool’s results in the Premier League title race, but the defender says the reigning champions will not allow themselves to become distracted. Another epic tussle for domestic supremacy is unfolding in the 2021-22 campaign, with two heavyweights of world football slugging it out for the right to be crowned kings of England. There is little to choose between them at present, with Man City delivering the perfect response to Liverpool’s 1-0 victory at Newcastle when they went to Leeds and claimed a convincing 4-0 win. Laporte has revealed Man City did go out of their way to watch Liverpool’s match at St James’ Park, but told the club’s official website: “It was very important to win (against Leeds) and we did it. We need to continue the same way. “We knew Liverpool had won earlier and they keep getting good results, so we had to do it as well. “I think we have been at a great level all season and today we managed to respond to the pressure with another solid performance. “Of course, we watch Liverpool games and results, but we only focus on ourselves and to make sure we do our job.” Manchester City go back above Liverpool after beating Leeds 4-0 🔝 pic.twitter.com/F2DPxgzUDY Both the Citizens and Reds have just five more Premier League fixtures this season.

https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-city-prove-mettle-leeds-liverpool-title-race/blt99e0ed2b5f629890,Keep calm and carry on: Man City prove their mettle at Leeds to keep Liverpool at bay in title race,"Leeds United 0-4 Manchester City: Match Statistics Amid the chaos, Manchester City kept calm to keep their destiny in their own hands. At Elland Road on Saturday evening, Leeds United did everything they could to drag Pep Guardiola's side into a match of disarray and disorder; one that was just as crucial to their relegation battle as it was to City's Premier League title hopes. However, City know how to hold their nerve in high-pressure situations and, thanks to a 4-0 win which restored their one-point advantage over Liverpool at the top of the table, the English champions are now just four more victories away from retaining their title. Tuesday night's chaotic Champions League victory over Real Madrid was an extreme example of what can happen if you throw City out of their rhythm, with both sides exchanging punches like two heavyweight sluggers, and Guardiola is determined to stop it happening too often. Ruben Dias returned to the ground where he made his City debut in October 2020 and instantly pulled together a struggling defence – and reprised the role here alongside Aymeric Laporte. City's centre-back pairing provided City with the platform for their success, shutting down a passionate but toothless Leeds side who didn't manage a shot on target until the 89th minute. Still, the hosts gave their all from start to finish, and there were undeniably moments in the first half when City looked upset by the home side's physical approach. Bernardo Silva quarrelled with the home side's bench, Guardiola and Jack Grealish exchanged views over a hacked clearance, and Joao Cancelo almost recreated Seven Gerrard's infamous slip that cost Liverpool the 2014 title, before Ilkay Gundogan sprinted back to save his embarrassment. Manchester City go back above Liverpool after beating Leeds 4-0 🔝 pic.twitter.com/F2DPxgzUDY However, City were ultimately far too strong for their opponents, even though Guardiola rotated his squad ahead of the return to the Santiago Bernabeu, with Kevin De Bruyne and Silva missing as part of a calculated gamble. Raheem Sterling was recalled and danced through what looked like the floor of a school disco after Leeds fans covered the pitch with paper detritus, and he was unfortunate not to find the goal. On the other side, £100 million Jack Grealish sparkled sporadically in between being targeted by the fans and Leeds players. Stuart Dallas, caught him late with one challenge, but came off worse and unfortunately left the pitch on a stretcher. Again, though, it was the magic of Phil Foden that was the biggest threat. A certain starter in the Spanish capital, he moved to a more central role and pulled the strings and pulled the Leeds defence apart. He claimed two assists, the first with a driven free-kick that Rodri simply had to touch in to put City ahead. His second, and City's third, showcased why the No.8 position will be his long-term role, as he drove at the Leeds defence and played a beautifully-weighted pass for Gabriel Jesus to score his sixth goal in three games. Guardiola's instant reaction was to take Foden off and wrap him up for the huge second leg in the Spanish capital on Wednesday. The pressure may be building, but City show no signs of imploding.

""This is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag,"" he said, after Ronaldo rescued United again on Thursday night by scoring the equaliser in their 1-1 with Chelsea. ""He's showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but it's obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, it's pretty obvious."" Rangnick wants United to find and develop ""future top, star players"" who can be moulded into the club's ways rather than buying a player who is already the finished product, as they have been keen to do in recent years. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The interim boss believes combining that approach with consistent recruitment at each opportunity can, again, move United closer to the country's top teams. ""If you think of Manchester City and Liverpool, they brought in [players] every transfer window,"" he said. ""They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world. ""I wouldn't be surprised if they play in the Champions League final in a few weeks. This shows it is possible that this can happen and it would not necessarily need three, four years in order to do that."" Ironically, United face Brentford on Monday Night Football, live on Sky Sports, a club renowned for their work in the transfer market. The Bees have reached the top-flight with their Moneyball-style use of data to drive their player recruitment - making only four signings last summer to help comfortably keep them in the Premier League for a second season. Rangnick rightly points out the difference in size between United and Brentford, which has to be taken into consideration when the two are signing players and their approach to it, but agrees every club needs to follow an 'idea'. ""No matter which club, it is always necessary and important that you need an idea,"" he said. ""You need to know how you want to play, what kind of profiles do we need because if you do not do that, you're always looking for the needle in the haystack. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""This is what I meant when I said 'open heart surgery'. I don't think it's enough to do some minor corrections and amendments. I think it's important to see the big picture and then hopefully bring in the best possible players. ""They should also fit together, this is also an issue, it is not only about bringing some players for defence, midfield and up front, it's also important you get to know the personality of the players and that they really fit and are able to meet the standards of this big club."" In the meantime, as United prepare to play their final home game of the season, Rangnick will keep on waiting to share his ideas with the man responsible for rebuilding United.

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/12582098/erik-ten-hag-manchester-united-appoint-ajax-boss-as-new-manager,Erik ten Hag: Manchester United appoint Ajax boss as new manager,"Manchester United have appointed Ajax boss Erik ten Hag as their new manager, to replace interim Ralf Rangnick at the end of the season. Sky Sports News reported on March 31 Ten Hag was in pole position to land the job over Mauricio Pochettino, with sources close to the manager and Ajax revealing compensation is below £2m. The 52-year-old has signed a three-year deal with the option of a further 12 months. He told United's website: ""It is a great honour to be appointed manager of Manchester United and I am hugely excited by the challenge ahead. ""I know the history of this great club and the passion of the fans, and I am absolutely determined to develop a team capable of delivering the success they deserve. ""It will be difficult to leave Ajax after these incredible years, and I can assure our fans of my complete commitment and focus on bringing this season to a successful conclusion before I move to Manchester United."" Mitchell van der Gaag, Ten Hag's assistant at Ajax, is likely to join him at Old Trafford with advanced negotiations already under way. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Edwin van der Sar, Ajax's chief executive and a former United goalkeeper, said, ""we would have liked to have kept Erik for longer"", but added, ""he is going to make the step to one of the biggest clubs in the world"". VOTE: Who should stay or leave Man Utd this summer? Why the scale of Man Utd rebuild is frightening Man Utd exodus: 18 players who could leave this summer Ten Hag Q&A: Carra's verdict on incoming Man Utd boss Ten Hag told Ajax's website: ""I'm happy that it has been finalised and that it has been officially announced. That clarity is important."" John Murtough, United's football director, said: ""During the past four years at Ajax, Erik has proved himself to be one of the most exciting and successful coaches in Europe, renowned for his team's attractive, attacking football and commitment to youth. ""In our conversations with Erik leading up to this appointment, we were deeply impressed with his long-term vision for returning Manchester United to the level we want to be competing at, and his drive and determination to achieve that. ""We wish Erik the best of luck as he focuses on achieving a successful end to the season at Ajax and look forward to welcoming him to Manchester United this summer."" Ten Hag was understood to be the unanimous choice at United following a rigorous recruitment process that was led by Murtough and Darren Fletcher, the technical director. Richard Arnold, the executive vice-chairman, was also involved and the trio are understood to have agreed Ten Hag was the best candidate for the job. Mauricio Pochettino, the Paris Saint-Germain manager who previously coached Tottenham and Southampton, and Julen Lopetegui, the Sevilla boss, were also interviewed by United, but the club are believed to have felt the Dutchman was the one that most closely aligned with their plans for the future. Pochettino and Lopetegui are understood to have interviewed well, while Luis Enrique was also considered until it quickly became apparent he was committed to Spain ahead of this year's World Cup. United were looking for a number of attributes from their new manager, including proven success, a commitment to youth, the ability to improve players and the will to introduce an attractive style of play. Ten Hag is said to have set out his long-term vision to build a successful and exciting team during conversations with United, in which he is also said to have shown enthusiasm for the challenge he now faces at Old Trafford. Sky Sports News understands Ten Hag will tell United players he does not want any passengers at the club. His key message to them will be that he is the manager, there is a new regime and United are going to go back to playing like Manchester United. If there are any players who are not up for the challenge, they are welcome to leave, but everyone will start with a clean slate. He has not been given any specific targets, but he knows his job is to make United great again. Ten Hag also wants Steve McClaren to return to United and talks about making that happen are ongoing. The good relationship between United and Ajax helped smooth the process to appoint Ten Hag. It is believed potential negotiations with PSG, had United opted for Pochettino, would have proved more problematic. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ten Hag will be United's fifth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. The club have won only three trophies in the following nine years - the FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League - while they are currently in danger of missing out on qualification for the Champions League next season. Ten Hag is set to oversee a much-needed rebuild at United, with Rangnick - who is due to take up a consultancy role at Old Trafford this summer - saying after the 4-0 thrashing at rivals Liverpool on Tuesday that the side may need up to 10 new players. A number of first-team players, including Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard and Edinson Cavani, could be set to leave as part of the overhaul, with their contracts expiring at the end of the season. On Wednesday, the departures of Jim Lawlor, United's chief scout, and Marcel Bout, the head of global scouting, were announced. Ralf Rangnick said Manchester United need to sign as many as 10 new players after their 4-0 thrashing by Liverpool on Tuesday night, but which players could leave in their rebuild? Man Utd are currently sixth in the Premier League, three points off the top four but having played a game more than both Tottenham (fourth) and Arsenal (fifth). Will they squeeze into the top four? Here are their remaining fixtures... Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports News' senior reporter Melissa Reddy: ""Manchester United's interest in Erik ten Hag came as no surprise given his status as one of the most progressive coaches in Europe, and his long links to their managerial vacancy. ""The 52-year-old has had admirers at Old Trafford stretching back to 2018/19, when his Ajax side knocked out Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, before then stunning Juventus and only being denied a place in the final after Lucas Moura's last-minute goal for Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham. ""Ten Hag is a popular choice to take charge at Old Trafford and represents what is seen as a ""fresh, exciting future"", although there is an acceptance risk is involved as it is a sizeable leap for him. ""The last highly-successful Ajax coach to move to England's top flight - via Inter - was Frank de Boer, who lasted just 77 days at Crystal Palace. ""The expectations, global glare placed on United, and level of competition at the top end of the Premier League is like nothing he would have previously experienced."" Kaveh Solhekol, Sky Sports' chief reporter: ""The timing is not ideal if you are an Ajax supporter as they are in a race to win the Dutch title, but when Man Utd came calling, Erik ten Hag really could not turn down the club. ""It suits Man Utd to make this statement today for a variety of reasons: from a PR point of view, everybody connected with Man Utd wants some good news at the moment and also, it makes it clear what is happening at Man Utd over the next few months. There is clarity now - all the players who are thinking of leaving, or who Man Utd want to sign, know Ten Hag is going to be the new manager. ""He is also going to have the whole of the summer and pre-season with the players, so that is perfect preparation as far as he is concerned. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I also think it is very significant he is being called the manager - we know one of the things he has been asking for is to be in control of everything. He does not just want to be a head coach - he wants to have control over the transfer strategy and recruitment as well. ""I think Man Utd have made a lot of mistakes when it has come to appointing managers since Sir Alex Ferguson left, but this time round they think they have the right man and obviously he has a big, big job to do. ""But people need to retain a sense of perspective as well - I know the team are not playing as well or in the kind of way a Man Utd team should be playing. But let's not forget, less than 12 months ago, Man Utd finished second in the Premier League, they finished above Liverpool and over the past decade, six of the last 10 seasons they have finished above Liverpool. ""Man Utd are still a massive, massive club - one of the biggest clubs in the world. There are obviously still issues with the ownership structure, the way the club is run, but the big problem is they have not had the right manager in charge, and when they have had the right man, they have not given that manager enough time. ""This time round, when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer lost his job five months ago, we told you the replacement was going to be either Mauricio Pochettino or Erik ten Hag. I know a lot of people would have preferred Pochettino as he had Premier League experience with Southampton and Spurs, so it is a bit of a risk going for Ten Hag. ""Yes, he has done very well in Holland, but he has been managing the biggest club in Holland, he does not have any Premier League experience, but United have spoken to various candidates, they have interviewed Ten Hag, they interviewed Pochettino as well, and they have decided to go for Ten Hag. From United's point of view, it is great they have been able to get Ten Hag and announce it so quickly."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Gary Neville speaking on The Overlap in March: ""Ten Hag worked in Bayern Munich when Pep Guardiola was there. We know the impact that had. He's won a couple of titles and cups in Holland. His style of play is good. He's got more experience than I think most people think at the age of 52. ""It's a massive jump but he's got a good coaching pedigree. He's not scarred and that's a good thing - he comes in fresh. I did a poll the other week and I was absolutely stunned - 220,000 people voted and 82 per cent were in favour of bringing him in over [Mauricio] Pochettino. ""I knew that he would be favourite because you can smell it on social media. I think Manchester United fans are demanding a fresh start and a fresh name. They want something that's completely different that they've not had before, and that's probably gone against Pochettino in some ways."" Sky Sports' Adam Bate: ""Erik ten Hag will go to Manchester United as an outsider tasked with implementing cultural change at one of the world's most famous clubs. But that is a job that he has done before. ""At Ajax, they mocked his accent. He was a Tukker - a man from the east of the country, a region known for a down-to-earth approach. There were those in sophisticated Amsterdam who did not believe the great Ajax had anything to learn from him. They were wrong. ""Two domestic doubles and one kick away from a Champions League final later and there is an acceptance Ten Hag has brought some of the best football that Ajax have seen in years. His methods have delivered success, his manner has won over the doubters."" Ten Hag's coaching journey from Twente to Ajax via Go Ahead Eagles explained in-depth by those who were there from the start... Erik ten Hag must waste no timing in tackling the pressing issues at Manchester United. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick - who is due to take up a consultancy role at Old Trafford this summer - believes the team could require 10 new players as part of a huge rebuild. With United having finally confirmed the appointment of their new manager, Sky Sports takes a look at some of the key problem areas he must rectify... Erik Ten Hag's announcement as Manchester United's new manager means we've ripped up the script for the Essential Football Podcast, with the Dutchman's unveiling heralding - yet another - new era at Old Trafford. Host Ron Walker is joined by Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher as well as senior football writer Peter Smith and features writer Adam Bate to talk about the new man, what United can expect from him and the challenges he faces at Old Trafford.

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/12599944/where-could-each-premier-league-team-finish,Premier League clubs' best and worst possible final positions in table,"Manchester City and Liverpool are locked in a two-horse race for the Premier League title - but how high or low could your club finish this season? Clubs have between two and five games left to seal their fate but 19 out of 20 clubs are still challenging for the title, qualification for the Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League, or to avoid the drop. Data guru Ben Mayhew has calculated each club's range of possible final league positions and found only Norwich have nothing to play for besides pride during the remainder of this season. Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United are all in the hunt to join title-tussling Manchester City and Liverpool in the top four - with Spurs and United potentially slipping as low as eighth to miss out on Europe next season altogether. With seventh spot being the lowest position to potentially offer a European berth, if permutations play out across competitions, it means all teams from fifth to 13th-placed Aston Villa retain the potential to qualify for Europe. Norwich were relegated on Saturday after a 2-0 defeat to Villa and results conspired against them elsewhere, but, theoretically, every single team sitting above the Canaries up to ninth-placed Brighton could finish in the drop zone. Watford have been widely written off in the survival race but the Hornets could still finish in 16th, while the attention for that final relegation spot centres on Everton, Leeds and Burnley - but all three could still secure a top-half finish. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Premier League fixtures Mayhew has also simulated every possible result from the remaining games and calculated the probabilities of each club's possible final positions. The results suggest Manchester City have a 69-per-cent chance of retaining their Premier League crown, while Liverpool have almost the same chance of finishing as runners-up. Chelsea are nailed down for third spot at 93 per cent, with Arsenal pipping Tottenham to the final Champions League berth at 74 per cent - while Manchester United have a whopping 94-per-cent-chance of finishing in their current sixth spot. Each club’s attacking and defensive strength have been rated using an expected goals model, which measures the quality of chances they create and allow.  These ratings were then used to simulate the rest of the season 10,000 times to measure the probability of each club finishing in each league position. Further down the table - between Brighton and Southampton - things become far less predictable, with fairly even spreads between ninth and 15th. The probabilities consign Watford to the Championship but the pressure ramps up for the final drop spot, with Leeds favourites to finish in 18th (46 per cent), followed by Everton (31 per cent) and Burnley (23 per cent).

I obviously have good memories of him. He was a good character in the dressing room. Me and Peter weren't best of mates - actually far from it - but the most important thing is that I had huge respect for him and he produced in big moments and helped us get over the line in big matches. Peter would produce and help us win trophies. He was not getting called upon a lot but when he did he would produce. He made some excellent saves.""

""I could not leave Jaap Stam out. OK, he has not played as many games as the other lads but he was big and strong, brilliant one-v-ones. Did he have any real weaknesses? He could head it, he could leap, he could read the game, he was aggressive. He was a decent lad. I got on really well with him. I was not surprised when he left. He'd had a bad injury and when you are at a top club players do come and go. But he was a brilliant player for Manchester United."" ""The other one was an issue but I have gone with Gary Pallister. Brucey was a brilliant player but you have to leave someone out. Rio was obviously a good athlete and read the game well but my relationship with Pally was pretty good as well. Certain lads at United go out of their way to help you. He was obviously a very good player. Always looked exhausted but I would have him in there."" ""Bryan Robson has to go in there. Bryan was a great player for Manchester United, full of courage and scored some big goals for Manchester United when the club was not at its best. I played against Robbo a few times at Forest.

However, even if Liverpool fail to make it to the French capital, they have still managed to surpass the Chelsea side of 2006/07, whose own Quadruple challenge lasted all the way until May 1 of that campaign before losing to Liverpool in the Champions League semi-finals. And if Liverpool do manage to see off Villarreal on Tuesday, their next leg of the Quadruple will come against Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley on May 14, a repeat of this season's League Cup final, which the Reds won on penalties in February. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, in the race for the Premier League, Liverpool still just a point behind City as we enter the final four games of the season after an impressive unbeaten run in the league saw the champions' seemingly unsurmountable 14-point lead on January 15 evaporate. In total, Liverpool could face a gruelling seven-match schedule in May if they make it through to the final of European Cup at the Stade de France. So, how have other English teams got on when faced with such a daunting challenge, while surely the trophy-laden Liverpool sides of the 80s must have gone close to achieving the feat? And what about some of the great European giants of years gone by? Liverpool fixtures Premier League table As is surely common knowledge by now, no English team has ever won the Quadruple. Prior to this season, the closest any top-flight side had ever got to winning all four major trophies in a single campaign was Chelsea back in 2006/07. Heading into May of that season, Jose Mourinho's back-to-back Premier League champions had already landed the League Cup after beating Arsenal 2-1 at the Millennium Stadium, while they had an FA Cup final date to look forward to with Manchester United, who they were also going toe to toe with in the league. However, the Blues' challenge ended when they lost on penalties to Liverpool at Anfield in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final, while they would also go on to lose their title to United. Manchester United also came close to making history in 2008/09, only to slip up in the semi-finals of the FA Cup when losing 4-2 on penalties to Everton, although they did then get beaten 2-0 by Barcelona in that season's Champions League final in Rome. And, of course, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side have had numerous Quadruple bids as well since the Catalan arrived at the Etihad, the closest being in 2018/19 and last season. However, the former challenge was ended by Tottenham in the Champions League last eight and the latter after a defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals. Liverpool's current quest, though, will last at least until May 3, when the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with Villarreal concludes, meaning their Quadruple campaign will have lasted longer than any other English team's in history. And before you ask, Manchester United's famous Treble-winning season of 1998/99 actually included a League Cup quarter-final loss at Spurs in the December of that campaign. You would have thought Liverpool have come close before, but actually they have not, despite winning the League Cup four years in a row from 1981. It was the FA Cup that ultimately proved to be Liverpool's Achilles' heel in each of those four campaigns, with the Reds never managing to make it past the fifth round, meaning the closest they came was in 1982/83, only for a shock 2-1 home defeat to second division Brighton to end their Quadruple dreams in February. And it was Brighton again in the cup who scuppered the Reds' chances of winning all four trophies in their Treble-winning campaign the following season. Oddly enough, despite Klopp's 'Mentality Monsters' barely losing a game between 2018 and 2020, they never actually came close to winning the Quadruple. In fact, the nearest they came to achieving the feat was in their title-winning campaign of 2019/20, only for a youth side - selected because of a fixture clash with the Club World Cup - to lose 5-0 at Aston Villa in the League Cup quarter-finals to put an end that dream. In the first season in England when four trophies were up for grabs in 1960/61, it was Burnley who came closest before losing to Hamburg in the last eight of the European Cup in March 1961. However, Celtic did manage to accomplish the seemingly impossible in 1966-67 when Jock Stein's 'Lisbon Lions' won it all - the Scottish First Division, League Cup and Scottish Cup, followed by the first European Cup won by a British team after victory over Inter Milan. Well, the first thing to point out here is that up until the 2019-20 season, France, as in England, was the only other country in Europe's top-five major leagues to have an extra cup competition in the form of the League Cup, or Coupe de la Ligue. So that explains why European giants like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus have all never previously won the Quadruple. Paris Saint-Germain did, though, recently come within a whisker of pulling it off under Thomas Tuchel, only to fall agonisingly at the final hurdle. The big-spending Parisians were awarded that season's Ligue 1 title in April based on a points-per-game ratio after the campaign was prematurely curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when the season did eventually resume, PSG beat St Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final on July 24, before edging out Lyon 6-5 on penalties to claim the Coupe de la Ligue the following weekend. Then, when the Champions League also returned in August, Tuchel's team made it all the way to the final for the first time in the club's history, before unluckily losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. All of which shows just what a mountain Klopp and Co still face in order to make history this season...

United stopped talk of a potential walk-out demonstration by beating Brentford 3-0 in Rangnick's final home game as interim manager. Old Trafford had a feel-good environment for the game after a wretched season as it closed its doors for the summer with farewells to a host of first-team players who are out of contract. Nemanja Matic, Juan Mata, Phil Jones and Edinson Cavani in all probability made their final Old Trafford appearances, while Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard are also out of contract in the summer. Rangnick told Sky Sports: ""Apart from goalkeeping where we have three excellent goalkeepers in Tom Heaton, Dean Henderson and David de Gea, in all other areas there will be players leaving the club. I wouldn't put focus on special areas of the pitch - it should go through the whole team. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""So far we haven't been able to speak [to Ten Hag]. Erik's focus is on winning the Dutch league, our focus was on our games. ""It's obvious quite a few players will leave and there is a need for top-quality players. I strongly believe that if everyone works together we can bring Man Utd back to where we need to be. ""Other clubs only needed two or three transfer windows to challenge but from now on we need to bring in top-quality players who really help raise the level. If this happens then I don't think it should take too long."" Man Utd 3-0 Brentford - Match report Get Sky Sports Premier League table Premier League fixtures Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  One of the first players Erik ten Hag will need to talk to surrounding the future will be Cristiano Ronaldo, who has now scored nine of United's last 12 goals in the Premier League with a penalty in the 3-0 win. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner won the man-of-the-match award from Sky Sports co-commentator Gary Neville. Ronaldo's future has been cast into doubt due to United's likely failure to qualify for the Champions League, but his current deal runs until the summer of 2023. Rangnick believes if Ronaldo stays next season, he will need support in central striking positions as the player himself isn't fully comfortable at his age playing in the lone striking role. He said: ""Cristiano is not a central striker. He does not want to play in that position, in order to not play central, you have to play two strikers. If you look into international football, there are not many teams who play with two, you either have three or a false nine. It's not a question of a position, the club needs two new strikers who give this team more quality. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Modern strikers do not have to be wingers if you look at Liverpool and Man City, they have top strikers. Gabriel Jesus has hardly played and now he's playing regularly. If you ask me if he's a central striker or a winger, is Grealish a striker, they can switch and rotate. We don't have that many. Mason Greenwood would have been those players, but he's no longer part of the squad. Martial went on loan at Seville, Cavani has been injured."" United were pretty comfortable against Brentford and - with Ronaldo at the forefront - looked fluid and creative in attack. The result looks to have almost guaranteed their qualification for the Europa League next term by finishing sixth or higher - instead of playing in the Europa Conference League. ""In the end I'm not happy with the results [overall], especially in the last four or five weeks,"" Rangnick added. ""Until the West Ham game we were still in the race in three competitions. We had good moments until that West Ham game, we conceded fewer goals but in the last few weeks performances have not been as good as they should have been. In general we have lacked consistency.""

Gary Neville threw that question to his colleagues in the studio during Monday Night Football as Jamie Carragher and Roy Keane discussed the ""catastrophic fall"" and how long it might take Erik ten Hag to turn the club around. ""It is a question really for the lads, I have been asked it a few times and said that I haven't got a clue what has gone wrong really at Manchester United this season. The first task for me really is to find out what has gone wrong. ""Why has this catastrophic fall occurred? ""Why has this team that finished second last season, 10 to 12 points behind City, found themselves where they are? I still can't put my finger on that. Surely that is something that Ten Hag has to deal with first and foremost?"" Carragher pointed to the noises coming out of the dressing room. ""I think it is really interesting hearing stories about how toxic the dressing room is. Under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, there was something about Manchester United. They were nowhere near as good as Liverpool or City, but they looked like decent lads, a decent group. ""But the things that keep coming out about what is going on inside the club, who is that and where does it come from?

We were not talking about that in the last two seasons. It feels like we have been talking about it a lot this season."" Keane reiterated the importance of character. ""If you have not got a decent dressing room, forget about it, you are in trouble anyway,"" said the former United captain. ""Whatever about the talent and the board room and who the manager is, you have to have a decent dressing room, decent personalities, decent characters. ""We have seen Manchester United through the season, when things have gone against them, that is it, they throw the towel in. That is a bad reflection on the players - the senior players and the younger ones who think they have made it and are players."" Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho were signed last summer with many expecting to see an improvement. Instead, the opposite happened. Was their arrival part of the problem, perhaps? ""That is the only thing you can point to,"" said Neville. ""You can point towards Ole reaching his height and they could not go any further and they got, not sick of the message, but it had become stale and they did not believe he could overtake Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola. ""Or something had disrupted that changing room. They had put the wrong ingredient into the dish and it has made it completely go sour. That is the bit that has to be dealt with because these players are not as bad as the points tally that is on that board. ""They are better than that. There is something deeper that is wrong in that dressing room that is making them play the way they are and get the results they are getting."" The task ahead of Ten Hag is not just to climb the table but ultimately to close what has become a vast gap to the teams chasing the Premier League title. For the third season in four, United are likely to finish more than 25 points behind the champions. Perusing the list of deficits since Sir Alex Ferguson last delivered the title in 2013, Keane stressed that the quality of the opposition is a big problem for United. ""It is ugly, that,"" said Keane. ""Whatever way you look at it, it is not good. We know it is a long way back for Manchester United but of course there is a way back. Maybe the new manager coming is a good time because I always think, you cannot get any worse. ""It is the points tally that worries me because they are so far behind. Even last season Ole finishing second and you're thinking he's doing well, there is such a big gap. The biggest problem for Manchester United is where Manchester City are, where Liverpool are. ""We talk about Manchester United rebuilding as if Liverpool and Manchester City are going to take it easy over the summer. They are going to invest, they are going to get players in, they are going to get stronger. Klopp is staying on, Pep might stay on. ""When he comes in they have to get the recruitment right, he has to get players in and the right players through the door because the last few years just have not been good enough. ""The biggest disappointment for me when they have had these disappointments is the reaction. I don't think they have shown the leadership. Whatever about talent, there are not enough characters in that dressing room."" Could the example of Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool provide the template for Ten Hag in terms of expectations and the timeframe in which the new man might have United challenging again? Carragher believes so. ""I think it is very similar, it really is,"" he explained. ""I think it was possibly a harder job for Jurgen Klopp because the funds are there for the next Manchester United manager. We have seen that over the last 10 years and going forward will be a lot more than what Klopp had when he first came in. ""People talk about how long it should take Ten Hag or any top manager at a top club. There is talk of Liverpool and Manchester City possibly being five years ahead, I have even heard 10 years ahead of Manchester United. I think it is rubbish, I really do. ""I think a top manager gets a top club back on track in a couple of years. That is not to say winning the title or the Champions League but they get them back on track where they are competing. ""Liverpool came in November and they finished eighth in his first season. In some ways it would probably be better for United if they finished eighth and there was no European football. ""But they still reached a Europa League final, beat Manchester United on the way, some top teams, Villarreal, Borussia Dortmund, you thought there was something happening.  ""In that second season, the first full season, he got Champions League. That has to be what Manchester United get next season under Ten Hag. He has to. ""Liverpool were back on track in that third season. All great clubs should be judged on the Premier League and the Champions League. Not necessarily winning it but in with a shout. ""That is where Liverpool come in, they were Champions League runners-up in season three. They go on to win it and then win the Premier League but they are back at the party in year three. That is why I think the talk of five years or more is a nonsense."" Neville rejects the idea that Klopp had it harder than Ten Hag. ""I don't think so. Jurgen Klopp has done the most outrageous job at Liverpool, it has been outstanding. But there were no real set winners at that time when he came in. ""I would liken the job that Ten Hag has coming in and taking on these two outstanding managers who have set foundations at their clubs for five years more like Gerard Houllier's job when he came in and Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger were set. ""You are coming in when there are two or three managers - because I could put Thomas Tuchel in there as well - are set in their jobs and have that foundation. I think the job that Ten Hag has is absolutely huge."" But Neville accepts the timeframe suggested by Carragher. ""I don't disagree with Jamie's timeline of Champions League [qualification] in the first two seasons while he is sorting the recruitment out and getting used to the club. Third season getting very close to the point where the club has confidence and winning a trophy maybe. ""And that fourth year and fifth year is where you want to be winning a title, that is what we are looking at realistically. We would all hope he comes in and blows everyone away and Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola blow up somehow. But they are not blowing up are they?"" Even so, Keane thinks Ten Hag will back himself to have a big impact. ""Any top coach would come in with a bit of an ego and believe they can make a difference - certainly to this group,"" said Keane. ""They can't get any worse next season, surely? They can maybe win a cup or whatever and rebuild the club. ""Any top manager will believe he can get a reaction from the players and he will get backing. It might take a couple of windows but a good manager will believe that he can turn things around pretty quickly. Not in terms of winning trophies, but competing. ""The fans and the club have to get confidence in this new manager. Over the last few years, there have been doubts about Mourinho's style, Van Gaal, David Moyes, Ole.

The 63-year-old is set to fail in his objective of leading the stuttering club to Champions League qualification but still hopes to leave a lasting legacy at Old Trafford. Rangnick will switch from United's interim boss to a consultancy role in the summer - a job that will run in tandem with his new position as manager of Austria's national team. The German has an impressive track record of developing teams, recently succeeding with RB Leipzig and sister club RB Salzburg, and believes transfers are key to providing incoming boss Erik ten Hag that platform to succeed. ""For me, the most important bit is recruitment now,"" Rangnick said when asked what he will be advising on. ""This is, for me, the most vital point, that we bring in the best possible players and speak about that, who could that be. ""It's not only identifying those players but meeting them, convincing them to join this club, even though we will not be playing in the Champions League. Get Sky Sports Premier League table Man Utd fixtures Transfer Centre LIVE! ""This is what I see as the most important bit. Again, also, with regard to top talented players for the academy, identifying those kind of players."" Asked if United can go back to buying players at the peak of their powers, Rangnick said: ""My personal opinion is that the club should try to find future top star players and develop them. ""Again, on the other hand, just tell me five players that might be some of those players that you spoke about."" When Haaland and Kylan Mbappe were reeled off, Rangnick said: ""Haaland is a young player. He's 21 or 22. This is one of those players I spoke about. ""But, on the other hand, he has developed in the last two years into one of probably the most expensive strikers in the world. ""But, yes, he could be, he would be one of those examples where I think the focus should be on to try and identify and find and then convince players who could be Manchester United players for the next couple of years."" Rangnick believes United's support, stadium and training facilities still make them an attractive proposition irrespective of Champions League qualification. But that view also comes with a dose of realism given rivals Manchester City and Liverpool are flying high, with the club targeting the ""full package"" of ""mentality, quality, physicality, pace, skills"" in new players. Rangnick says it is obvious that the team need additions given their struggles and departing players, with Monday's match against Brentford looking to be an Old Trafford farewell for out-of-contract Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic. ""I would like to (play them) but it's also about getting the best possible result and the best possible performance,"" he said. ""It's not about making any gifts to players. ""Juan Mata played the last 15 minutes, Nema almost the whole game, so it's not about saying farewell to the supporters. ""If that is possible I would do that or I would like to do that, but it's also about getting the best possible result."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Rangnick hopes to have Fred back for Monday's match and captain Harry Maguire may return, while Edinson Cavani - another out of contract in the summer - was due to return to training on Friday. But the 63-year-old says Jadon Sancho will be absent against Brentford and ""might be out for the rest of the season with his tonsillitis"". Asked if Sancho was having his tonsils out, Rangnick added: ""It could happen. ""He's definitely got an inflammation on his tonsils and has also had some high temperatures, so that's why he was not available (against Chelsea) and he will most certainly not be available for the next two games. ""Hopefully, they can get hold of that inflammation and then hopefully if the tonsils have to be taken out and removed this can happen at the end of the season.""

Even last season Ole finishing second and you're thinking he's doing well, there is such a big gap. The biggest problem for Manchester United is where Manchester City are, where Liverpool are. ""We talk about Manchester United rebuilding as if Liverpool and Manchester City are going to take it easy over the summer. They are going to invest, they are going to get players in, they are going to get stronger. Klopp is staying on, Pep might stay on. ""When he comes in they have to get the recruitment right, he has to get players in and the right players through the door because the last few years just have not been good enough. ""The biggest disappointment for me when they have had these disappointments is the reaction. I don't think they have shown the leadership. Whatever about talent, there are not enough characters in that dressing room."" Could the example of Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool provide the template for Ten Hag in terms of expectations and the timeframe in which the new man might have United challenging again? Carragher believes so. ""I think it is very similar, it really is,"" he explained. ""I think it was possibly a harder job for Jurgen Klopp because the funds are there for the next Manchester United manager. We have seen that over the last 10 years and going forward will be a lot more than what Klopp had when he first came in. ""People talk about how long it should take Ten Hag or any top manager at a top club. There is talk of Liverpool and Manchester City possibly being five years ahead, I have even heard 10 years ahead of Manchester United. I think it is rubbish, I really do. ""I think a top manager gets a top club back on track in a couple of years. That is not to say winning the title or the Champions League but they get them back on track where they are competing. ""Liverpool came in November and they finished eighth in his first season. In some ways it would probably be better for United if they finished eighth and there was no European football. ""But they still reached a Europa League final, beat Manchester United on the way, some top teams, Villarreal, Borussia Dortmund, you thought there was something happening.  ""In that second season, the first full season, he got Champions League. That has to be what Manchester United get next season under Ten Hag. He has to. ""Liverpool were back on track in that third season. All great clubs should be judged on the Premier League and the Champions League. Not necessarily winning it but in with a shout. ""That is where Liverpool come in, they were Champions League runners-up in season three. They go on to win it and then win the Premier League but they are back at the party in year three. That is why I think the talk of five years or more is a nonsense."" Neville rejects the idea that Klopp had it harder than Ten Hag. ""I don't think so. Jurgen Klopp has done the most outrageous job at Liverpool, it has been outstanding. But there were no real set winners at that time when he came in. ""I would liken the job that Ten Hag has coming in and taking on these two outstanding managers who have set foundations at their clubs for five years more like Gerard Houllier's job when he came in and Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger were set. ""You are coming in when there are two or three managers - because I could put Thomas Tuchel in there as well - are set in their jobs and have that foundation. I think the job that Ten Hag has is absolutely huge."" But Neville accepts the timeframe suggested by Carragher. ""I don't disagree with Jamie's timeline of Champions League [qualification] in the first two seasons while he is sorting the recruitment out and getting used to the club. Third season getting very close to the point where the club has confidence and winning a trophy maybe. ""And that fourth year and fifth year is where you want to be winning a title, that is what we are looking at realistically. We would all hope he comes in and blows everyone away and Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola blow up somehow. But they are not blowing up are they?"" Even so, Keane thinks Ten Hag will back himself to have a big impact. ""Any top coach would come in with a bit of an ego and believe they can make a difference - certainly to this group,"" said Keane. ""They can't get any worse next season, surely? They can maybe win a cup or whatever and rebuild the club. ""Any top manager will believe he can get a reaction from the players and he will get backing. It might take a couple of windows but a good manager will believe that he can turn things around pretty quickly. Not in terms of winning trophies, but competing. ""The fans and the club have to get confidence in this new manager. Over the last few years, there have been doubts about Mourinho's style, Van Gaal, David Moyes, Ole. When he comes in, he needs proper support and that power he deserves to get.""

The issue was discussed by UEFA at its Executive Committee meeting last week, and a vote will be taken at the UEFA Congress in Vienna on May 10. It is expected to be ratified then. When it is, for the first time in history, European football qualification will be based on something other than the season that has just finished. The proposals mean that, from 2024, there will be an extra two places in the Champions League reserved for European clubs who have failed to qualify via their domestic league, but who have traditionally done well in Europe's elite club competition. To use hypothetical examples from this current Premier League season, it would mean that if Chelsea, as reigning European champions, finished fifth in the Premier League, they would nevertheless stand a good chance of still qualifying for a Champions League spot for the following season. They currently rank fourth on UEFA's 10-year club coefficient. However, if West Ham were to finish fifth, they would not gain a place in the Champions League because they don't have a strong enough historical record in Europe. In fact, there are 89 clubs ahead of them in the 10-year rankings. One senior executive at a Premier League club told me that this means, for the very first time, the introduction of a ""two-tier system"" - one for the biggest clubs, one for the rest. CL wildcards - your questions answered PL or CL? What do Man City and Liverpool need to win? CL reforms 'Super League via back door', warns fans group Find out more about Sky Sports It's important to stress the new rules won't come into play until 2024. That same executive says there is also the danger of ""a creep effect"", where more and more places in the Champions League are allocated by historical European performance and not by current domestic success. ""It's almost like this is 'European Super League Lite', and the fear is that two might become four, might become eight - with the Champions League becoming more and more of a closed shop,"" they said. The idea that most worries other clubs is the idea of ""leap-frogging"" whereby a team finishing fifth in the Premier League automatically goes into the Europa League, and yet a team finishing behind them in sixth could be ""bumped"" into a more profitable Champions League spot - if they have a better ""coefficient"", or history in European football. Sky Sports News understands all 20 Premier League clubs unanimously asked league officials in 2021 to oppose UEFA's proposal for wildcard places that might lead to ""leap-frogging"" and the inevitable sporting integrity issues. It's thought the Premier League is still lobbying UEFA, via the European Leagues group, for the idea to be removed, with some apparent success. One such meeting happened on Tuesday, I'm told. As a result, it now looks likely that ""leap-frogging"" will be banned under the new UEFA plans, but the coefficient calculation will remain. That allows the possibility for the Big Six in England to all qualify for the Champions League each season, so long as they finish in the top six places in the Premier League. The sixth-placed team will qualify so long as the fifth-placed team does, and so long as their coefficient is among the top two from all of England, Spain, Italy and Germany. In the last year since the European Super League collapsed, a number of officials have told me that the ""coefficient qualification issue"" was a hugely controversial piece of football legislation that was offered in the background to help appease the biggest clubs in Europe and England. The hope was that, if the big clubs had some sort of safety net for missing out on Champions League qualification, they would drop their plans for a breakaway league. It worked. With the exception of Juventus, Barcelona and Real Madrid, the other nine elite clubs all backed out of the European Super League when offered this ""face-saving compromise"", and when confronted with the huge backlash from supporters. However, there has always been strong feeling within the bulk of Premier League clubs, I'm told, that this plan for wildcards to help the biggest clubs qualify for the Champions League is against the spirit of the game. They felt last year, and still do now, that the hugely significant changes had sneaked in almost unnoticed amid the noise and controversy surrounding the European Super League. One official has told us: ""They (Europe's elite clubs) got what they wanted from UEFA. They wanted a safety net, in case they missed out on qualification, and that's exactly what they are going to be given. ""The European Super League was a sideshow - it couldn't practically happen. But a ""super league"" within UEFA, via the Champions League, very much could happen."" In addition, in the aftermath of the collapse of the European Super League, the Premier League vowed to introduce a new Owners Charter which would provide legal guarantees that clubs couldn't try to break away in the future. The Government at the time said it was fully behind those plans to introduce ""appropriate legislation"" to protect football from breakaway leagues. In the year since the collapse of the European Super League, the Charter is yet to be agreed upon, or put to a vote. In fact, whilst it was on the Premier League shareholders' agenda in the first few months after the European Super League, it isn't any longer. Sky Sports News has been told by one club executive that the Owners Charter has been ""kicked into the long grass for now"" with no prospect of it being voted upon at any of the upcoming Premier League shareholders' meetings. Sources say it is simply too sensitive a subject between clubs to discuss right now. In the meantime, UEFA is still haggling over the final details of how the wildcard system will work, and there may be compromises in terms of the fixture congestion that the new Champions League format poses to the English football calendar. But compromises to the 'coefficient system' I'm told, are very unlikely. The idea of two extra wildcard places for the tournament is set in stone. And traditionally, whatever is put before the UEFA Executive Committee is voted through, so big changes are afoot next month. Another controversial issue still being discussed is the idea that the winners of the FA Cup might be able to claim a place in the Champions League. If there was to be a fifth Champions League spot available for the FA Cup winners, that would be unanimously applauded, I'm told. But that's not what's on offer. The proposal is that the FA Cup winners will only get a Champions League spot if their European coefficient is high enough - if they have traditionally done well in Europe. Again, this favours the big clubs. Of the current FA Cup semi-finalists, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Crystal Palace, Palace alone would miss out on the new European wildcard system if they were to lift the trophy. City, Liverpool and Chelsea's success in Europe would mean they would be very likely to get a wildcard into the Champions League, if they won the FA Cup (and didn't finish in the Premier League top four). And so, as one executive put it me, you could have two teams lining up at Wembley for the final potentially ""with very different prizes on offer to each."" ""The same prize has to be awarded whoever wins a trophy, and the idea you can get ""bumped"" is just wrong."" Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

Jurgen Klopp's team head to Spain leading 2-0 as they look to progress to the final of Europe's premier club competition in Paris on May 28 against either Man City or Real Madrid. However, even if Liverpool fail to make it to the French capital, they have still managed to surpass the Chelsea side of 2006/07, whose own Quadruple challenge lasted all the way until May 1 of that campaign before losing to Liverpool in the Champions League semi-finals. And if Liverpool do manage to see off Villarreal on Tuesday, their next leg of the Quadruple will come against Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley on May 14, a repeat of this season's League Cup final, which the Reds won on penalties in February. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, in the race for the Premier League, Liverpool still just a point behind City as we enter the final four games of the season after an impressive unbeaten run in the league saw the champions' seemingly unsurmountable 14-point lead on January 15 evaporate. In total, Liverpool could face a gruelling seven-match schedule in May if they make it through to the final of European Cup at the Stade de France. So, how have other English teams got on when faced with such a daunting challenge, while surely the trophy-laden Liverpool sides of the 80s must have gone close to achieving the feat? And what about some of the great European giants of years gone by? Liverpool fixtures Premier League table As is surely common knowledge by now, no English team has ever won the Quadruple. Prior to this season, the closest any top-flight side had ever got to winning all four major trophies in a single campaign was Chelsea back in 2006/07. Heading into May of that season, Jose Mourinho's back-to-back Premier League champions had already landed the League Cup after beating Arsenal 2-1 at the Millennium Stadium, while they had an FA Cup final date to look forward to with Manchester United, who they were also going toe to toe with in the league. However, the Blues' challenge ended when they lost on penalties to Liverpool at Anfield in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final, while they would also go on to lose their title to United. Manchester United also came close to making history in 2008/09, only to slip up in the semi-finals of the FA Cup when losing 4-2 on penalties to Everton, although they did then get beaten 2-0 by Barcelona in that season's Champions League final in Rome. And, of course, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side have had numerous Quadruple bids as well since the Catalan arrived at the Etihad, the closest being in 2018/19 and last season. However, the former challenge was ended by Tottenham in the Champions League last eight and the latter after a defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals. Liverpool's current quest, though, will last at least until May 3, when the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with Villarreal concludes, meaning their Quadruple campaign will have lasted longer than any other English team's in history. And before you ask, Manchester United's famous Treble-winning season of 1998/99 actually included a League Cup quarter-final loss at Spurs in the December of that campaign. You would have thought Liverpool have come close before, but actually they have not, despite winning the League Cup four years in a row from 1981. It was the FA Cup that ultimately proved to be Liverpool's Achilles' heel in each of those four campaigns, with the Reds never managing to make it past the fifth round, meaning the closest they came was in 1982/83, only for a shock 2-1 home defeat to second division Brighton to end their Quadruple dreams in February. And it was Brighton again in the cup who scuppered the Reds' chances of winning all four trophies in their Treble-winning campaign the following season. Oddly enough, despite Klopp's 'Mentality Monsters' barely losing a game between 2018 and 2020, they never actually came close to winning the Quadruple. In fact, the nearest they came to achieving the feat was in their title-winning campaign of 2019/20, only for a youth side - selected because of a fixture clash with the Club World Cup - to lose 5-0 at Aston Villa in the League Cup quarter-finals to put an end that dream. In the first season in England when four trophies were up for grabs in 1960/61, it was Burnley who came closest before losing to Hamburg in the last eight of the European Cup in March 1961. However, Celtic did manage to accomplish the seemingly impossible in 1966-67 when Jock Stein's 'Lisbon Lions' won it all - the Scottish First Division, League Cup and Scottish Cup, followed by the first European Cup won by a British team after victory over Inter Milan. Well, the first thing to point out here is that up until the 2019-20 season, France, as in England, was the only other country in Europe's top-five major leagues to have an extra cup competition in the form of the League Cup, or Coupe de la Ligue. So that explains why European giants like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus have all never previously won the Quadruple. Paris Saint-Germain did, though, recently come within a whisker of pulling it off under Thomas Tuchel, only to fall agonisingly at the final hurdle. The big-spending Parisians were awarded that season's Ligue 1 title in April based on a points-per-game ratio after the campaign was prematurely curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when the season did eventually resume, PSG beat St Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final on July 24, before edging out Lyon 6-5 on penalties to claim the Coupe de la Ligue the following weekend. Then, when the Champions League also returned in August, Tuchel's team made it all the way to the final for the first time in the club's history, before unluckily losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. All of which shows just what a mountain Klopp and Co still face in order to make history this season...

United stopped talk of a potential walk-out demonstration by beating Brentford 3-0 in Rangnick's final home game as interim manager. Old Trafford had a feel-good environment for the game after a wretched season as it closed its doors for the summer with farewells to a host of first-team players who are out of contract. Nemanja Matic, Juan Mata, Phil Jones and Edinson Cavani in all probability made their final Old Trafford appearances, while Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard are also out of contract in the summer. Rangnick told Sky Sports: ""Apart from goalkeeping where we have three excellent goalkeepers in Tom Heaton, Dean Henderson and David de Gea, in all other areas there will be players leaving the club. I wouldn't put focus on special areas of the pitch - it should go through the whole team. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""So far we haven't been able to speak [to Ten Hag]. Erik's focus is on winning the Dutch league, our focus was on our games. ""It's obvious quite a few players will leave and there is a need for top-quality players. I strongly believe that if everyone works together we can bring Man Utd back to where we need to be. ""Other clubs only needed two or three transfer windows to challenge but from now on we need to bring in top-quality players who really help raise the level. If this happens then I don't think it should take too long."" Man Utd 3-0 Brentford - Match report Get Sky Sports Premier League table Premier League fixtures Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  One of the first players Erik ten Hag will need to talk to surrounding the future will be Cristiano Ronaldo, who has now scored nine of United's last 12 goals in the Premier League with a penalty in the 3-0 win. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner won the man-of-the-match award from Sky Sports co-commentator Gary Neville. Ronaldo's future has been cast into doubt due to United's likely failure to qualify for the Champions League, but his current deal runs until the summer of 2023. Rangnick believes if Ronaldo stays next season, he will need support in central striking positions as the player himself isn't fully comfortable at his age playing in the lone striking role. He said: ""Cristiano is not a central striker. He does not want to play in that position, in order to not play central, you have to play two strikers. If you look into international football, there are not many teams who play with two, you either have three or a false nine. It's not a question of a position, the club needs two new strikers who give this team more quality. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Modern strikers do not have to be wingers if you look at Liverpool and Man City, they have top strikers. Gabriel Jesus has hardly played and now he's playing regularly. If you ask me if he's a central striker or a winger, is Grealish a striker, they can switch and rotate. We don't have that many. Mason Greenwood would have been those players, but he's no longer part of the squad. Martial went on loan at Seville, Cavani has been injured."" United were pretty comfortable against Brentford and - with Ronaldo at the forefront - looked fluid and creative in attack. The result looks to have almost guaranteed their qualification for the Europa League next term by finishing sixth or higher - instead of playing in the Europa Conference League. ""In the end I'm not happy with the results [overall], especially in the last four or five weeks,"" Rangnick added. ""Until the West Ham game we were still in the race in three competitions. We had good moments until that West Ham game, we conceded fewer goals but in the last few weeks performances have not been as good as they should have been. In general we have lacked consistency.""

Eight years after moving to David Moyes's Manchester United from Chelsea, the Spanish number eight appeared to wave goodbye in style. In United's 3-0 win over Brentford on Monday night, Mata rolled back the years to his early Premier League days - who knows if we'll see him in England's top flight again? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mata showed pace, precision and skill that defies his veteran years - linking up with Cristiano Ronaldo frequently in a commanding first-half display. The pair - with a combined age of 71 - showed intricate passing in tight spaces which forced Mata to shoot wide of David Raya's goal - before the duo linked up again for Ronaldo's goal that was ruled out by VAR for offside. Ralf Rangnick recognised how much better United played and perhaps Mata was the cause of that. United had 74 per cent possession of the ball in the first half, with a passing accuracy of 91 per cent. ""That is the reason why we were controlling the game,"" said the German. ""It had to do with the players on the pitch such as Juan, Bruno [Fernandes] and Nemanja Matic."" While players such as Matic have confirmed they will be leaving United this summer, Mata is yet to do so. Rangnick couldn't confirm what the Spaniard will do, but hailed the midfielder's skill and professionalism in equal measure. Premier League table Premier League results Watch Premier League highlights Get Sky Sports ""I don't know [what he will do], he hasn't confirmed that but it's possible [that he will leave]. It was an important night for players who have been here quite a long time. If it was their last game to say farewell like this. ""In the last couple of weeks, he showed how professional he is and how much he loves his game. You can feel and see how much he is a professional player. He almost played like a magician.""Sam Blitz This was Brentford's first defeat with Christian Eriksen in the starting line-up but the Dane was blameless for that at Old Trafford. He was their outstanding performer and one of the best players on the pitch throughout, showcasing that trademark distribution. ""He has been so good, Eriksen,"" said Gary Neville on co-commentary for Sky Sports, before wondering about the player's future in the summer. ""There will be clubs a lot higher up than Brentford looking at him. Manchester United need a new midfield…"" Whether that move will come to fruition is unclear but Eriksen will clearly have options. Despite this being a convincing victory for Manchester United - Brentford were well beaten - the playmaker still created more chances than any player on the home team. It is wonderful to see Eriksen performing at something close to his best. Having proven his fitness and at only 30 years old, there are not many squads that he would not improve. It will be intriguing to find out what he decides to do next. For now, just enjoy him.Adam Bate Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In a World Cup year, the credentials of most of England's regular talent are examined in detail, but none more so than the number one position. Based on Sunday's superhuman display, Gareth Southgate needn't look any further than Jordan Pickford in Qatar - his performance may even be good enough to convince the staunchest of doubters. On a day where Everton's survival bid depended on three points, their goalkeeper was a man mountain. In actual fact, Pickford may have registered not one but two submissions for 'save of the season' - denying both Cesar Azpilicueta and Antonio Rudiger with monumental stops in the second half. ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves,"" said Sky Sports' Graeme Souness. It's difficult to disagree. The Toffees approach to the game was aggressive and that worked to unsettle Chelsea, who were a shade below their level best. Regardless, no player epitomised the game plan more than Pickford, who was dogged and antagonistic from the off. The 28-year-old had to be at his acrobatic best to preserve an all-important clean sheet and coped impressively under some relentless pressure, with Lampard reaffirming why he is so highly thought of on Merseyside: ""Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top level goalkeeping."" In the two Premier League meetings between Everton and Chelsea this season, the England international has managed 14 saves, conceding just once. The result may well be the spark Everton require to pull off a remarkable escape with five games remaining. Needless to say, they will have to exhibit a similar amount of stubbornness in every fixture between now and the end of term if that bid is to be successful.Laura Hunter Everton captain Seamus Coleman: ""That save he came back off the line and parried out was world class, and we see that on a daily basis in training, and that is why he is England's number one - some of the saves were world class.""   Everton boss Frank Lampard: ""Jordan made great saves. They are Chelsea and will have chances, but we had chances as well. Jordan is such a great lad, he is England's number one and that is the reason why. That is top-level goalkeeping, I am happy with him and all the players, and all the subs who came on.""   Sky Sports' Graeme Souness: ""Jordan Pickford won the game for Everton single-handedly with his saves. Some of the saves he's not entitled to get anywhere near them.""   Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp: ""The one to deny Azpilicueta is the save of the season. It was magnificent. We've given Pickford a lot of stick in the past, but he was brilliant.""

On a day when Mikel Arteta's side were some way below their fluid best, their stand-in centre-back typified the grit that got them over the line. Holding, starting alongside Gabriel Magalhaes in the absence of the injured Ben White, ensured Arsenal did not miss a player who had started more Premier League minutes than any other this season. He took his goal superbly, rising between two West Ham defenders to flick Bukayo Saka's corner past Lukasz Fabianski, but it was at the other end of the pitch that he truly shone. Shortly before his goal, there was a stunning block to deny the unmarked Manuel Lanzini. It was one of three he made over the course of the 90 minutes - two more than any other player. Holding put his body on the line repeatedly and also made nearly twice as many clearances (seven) as any of his team-mates. He was brave but also smart, positioning himself intelligently to cut out passes and ensure West Ham's forwards rarely threatened. Arteta was delighted by his contribution and talked up his importance in the dressing room - even if he does not get as many opportunities as he would like on the pitch. ""To good people, good things happen,"" said the Arsenal manager in his press conference. ""He's a phenomenal person and when you ask him to come, he's always ready."" With four, nerve-shredding games remaining in a gruelling top-four race, Holding's grit is sure to be needed again. Nick Wright Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tottenham's season has reached a defining stage. The long-awaited north London derby comes after a trip to title-chasing Liverpool, a daunting double before season-ending fixtures against Burnley and already-relegated Norwich. Sunday's victory over Leicester ensured Spurs' destiny remains in their hands ahead of the run-in and provided yet more evidence that Antonio Conte's squad harbours the talent required to complete a task that looked so unlikely when the Italian was appointed. Only Mohamed Salah has more Premier League goals to his name this season than Heung-min Son after the South Korean took his tally to 19 for the campaign in style with Spurs' spectacular third against the Foxes. It came after Son's first-half corner had set up Harry Kane for Tottenham's opener, with the striker ending his five-game goal drought with a clinical stooping header. The rekindling of Kane's goalscoring touch was enhanced by the impact surprise omission Dejan Kulusevski had coming off the bench and setting up both of Son's goals. Spurs' front three are firing - at the perfect time. If Spurs are going to pip north London rivals Arsenal to Champions League football, their front three are going to be crucial. Ahead of a pivotal final four games of the season, the manner of the victory over Leicester should have instilled confidence they can get the job done.Jack Wilkinson Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  North London is chasing. That's what will be at the forefront of Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel's mind after conceding defeat to a team blighted by potential relegation concerns. Perhaps Chelsea legs were tired - a legitimate grievance given they played away at Manchester United three days ago - but their performance was reserved, almost standoffish. Chelsea were far too kind to a side whose desperation could have easily played into their own hands. Chances were spurned, despite a heroic display from Everton stopper Jordan Pickford - over half of Chelsea's attempted shots (11) were off target. And yet there was still no sign of Romelu Lukaku from the bench. Third spot is still the Blues to lose, but both Arsenal and Tottenham are closing in. Stamford Bridge will now be cautiously looking over its proverbial shoulder. Three of Chelsea's six Premier League losses this season have come in their last six games - so is form a problem ahead of an FA Cup final against high-flying Liverpool on May 14? Well, it's clear that a prerequisite of the Chelsea job is silverware - something that Tuchel has previously delivered. But this season threatens to crumble if Chelsea manage to slip out of the top-four race and allow favourites Liverpool to clinch the FA Cup. The latter is the likelier of scenarios, but Chelsea must remain alert. They face Wolves, Leeds, Leicester and Watford in the Premier League run-in; crucially, three of those fixtures are at home. The Blues must draw upon their Stamford Bridge dominance to see them through a tricky patch and ensure they supersede their London rivals in the hunt for a top three finish.Laura Hunter Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Leicester have conceded 14 goals from corners in the Premier League this season, the most of any side, and it once again led to their downfall at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The visitors had started promisingly, with Patson Daka striking the foot of a post from inside the Tottenham area. But against the run of play the hosts took the lead when Harry Kane headed in from a corner, completely unmarked, which spurred them on to a 3-1 victory. Rodgers made eight changes to his side, with their focus firmly on the Europa Conference League semi-finals, yet no matter who they have fielded during this campaign, defending corners has been a constant issue. ""Defending corners has been a problem for us all season - we lack aggression and cuteness. It was so disappointing,"" said Rodgers, whose side have surpassed the most conceded in a single season since Brighton's 16 in 2017-18. ""It is something we will have to look at in the summer through personnel. The mentality to head the ball is missing, it's something we would need to address.""David Richardson Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

The final obstacle in Liverpool's quest to reach a third Champions League final in five seasons sees them head to Spain with a 2-0 advantage after last week's comprehensive first-leg victory at Anfield. Despite holding a commanding advantage, Klopp is under no illusions there is still a job to be done and is relishing the challenge that only Champions League semi-finals produce. ""We know that it is half-time,"" Klopp told his pre-match press conference. ""In the best possible way we have to ignore the result from the first leg. If it were a cup game where only one game decided, and we had to go to Villarreal, we would try to win there. ""We know they will give all they have, that is absolutely clear. With all the things Unai said after the game… it's going to be a tough one but that is completely fine. Champions League semi-finals should be tough; we never expect them to be easy and this will not be easy. But we played a good game at home and we better play a good game there as well."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Klopp continued: ""At this moment, a Champions League semi-final is the most important game you can play. Whatever happened in the last few weeks or will happen in the next few weeks is not important, for this moment is clear. ""You never know if you will reach a semi-final again or if we will ever have the chance again to go to the final, you never know. We have an exceptional team here and nothing is for granted.

Klopp is adamant Liverpool are prepared for such an examination in order to progress through their Champions League semi-final and reach the third final of his tenure on Merseyside. ""We have to be ready to suffer,"" Klopp added. ""Not being a goal down - which can happen - but giving the game the right direction. ""A good example was Newcastle. The crowd was very passionate but we didn't let it happen, which was the biggest quality for this game. It wasn't a show of football brilliance. Of course we could have scored more goals but how clear-cut the performance was incredible. ""Yes we have to be emotional, ready to play the best game ever, but knowing it will not happen in moments. Suffering doesn't mean you suffer for long, you suffer and then you react."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Klopp added: ""Maturity and experience are very important, but they are not the only decisive things. You can be old and know everything about football but unable to play anymore, so that cannot be useful. ""Everything what we are will be required tomorrow night, that's it. We have to be ready to play a top, top game because they will go for us. They will high press, they will try to play much more football than we allowed them in the first game. ""Unai will for sure try to adapt a few things to our style. It will be really interesting. Maturity will be important but it's not the only thing."" Villarreal manager Unai Emery admits his side need to play the perfect game if they are to shock Liverpool to reach the club's first Champions League final. The former Arsenal boss was reminded their opponents had lost just three of 56 matches in a quadruple-chasing season. ""I didn't want to hear those details but I did,"" he said. ""It is a difficult task but we are working on the game. We need to play a perfect game. ""We need to find our excellence in certain things and maybe achieve something no one has achieved, which is this kind of comeback. We will try to find some weak spots, something that no one has done this season."" There was some positive news for Emery with striker Gerard Moreno, who missed the first leg, back after injury, although they will be missing former Bournemouth winger Arnaut Danjuma who is ill. ""Gerard trained with the rest of the group today,"" said the Villarreal boss. ""I don't know to what extent he will be fit for contention. We will not take any risks."" Sky Sports' Gary Neville: ""I really enjoyed the Liverpool-Villarreal first leg. Villarreal were massive underdogs, defending so deep in the 4-4-2 system. I thought highly of Liverpool and their persistence. ""Liverpool were doing the right things. Liverpool are a team who can win in different ways. They can outbox you; they can go toe to toe with you, punch for punch and they can be patient. Liverpool have demonstrated that in the last few years, they can wait, they can pass it around, they don't get panicky. ""I remember that game where they lost the title under Brendan Rodgers- they didn't have the experience to handle a different type of opponent. When Chelsea held back that day, they got very frustrated. ""I think it was a really good performance from Liverpool in the first leg, it was really professional. They should win that game, no doubt. Liverpool certainly [will qualify] - and that doesn't mean I don't respect Villarreal."" Sky Sports' Gary Neville: ""Liverpool are seven games from a Quadruple - seven games from a quadruple. That is the closest I think that anybody will ever have been to a Quadruple. I might be wrong. Someone will probably prove me wrong, but I can't think of a time.

Clubs have between two and five games left to seal their fate but 19 out of 20 clubs are still challenging for the title, qualification for the Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League, or to avoid the drop. Data guru Ben Mayhew has calculated each club's range of possible final league positions and found only Norwich have nothing to play for besides pride during the remainder of this season. Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United are all in the hunt to join title-tussling Manchester City and Liverpool in the top four - with Spurs and United potentially slipping as low as eighth to miss out on Europe next season altogether. With seventh spot being the lowest position to potentially offer a European berth, if permutations play out across competitions, it means all teams from fifth to 13th-placed Aston Villa retain the potential to qualify for Europe. Norwich were relegated on Saturday after a 2-0 defeat to Villa and results conspired against them elsewhere, but, theoretically, every single team sitting above the Canaries up to ninth-placed Brighton could finish in the drop zone. Watford have been widely written off in the survival race but the Hornets could still finish in 16th, while the attention for that final relegation spot centres on Everton, Leeds and Burnley - but all three could still secure a top-half finish. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Premier League fixtures Mayhew has also simulated every possible result from the remaining games and calculated the probabilities of each club's possible final positions. The results suggest Manchester City have a 69-per-cent chance of retaining their Premier League crown, while Liverpool have almost the same chance of finishing as runners-up. Chelsea are nailed down for third spot at 93 per cent, with Arsenal pipping Tottenham to the final Champions League berth at 74 per cent - while Manchester United have a whopping 94-per-cent-chance of finishing in their current sixth spot. Each club’s attacking and defensive strength have been rated using an expected goals model, which measures the quality of chances they create and allow.  These ratings were then used to simulate the rest of the season 10,000 times to measure the probability of each club finishing in each league position. Further down the table - between Brighton and Southampton - things become far less predictable, with fairly even spreads between ninth and 15th. The probabilities consign Watford to the Championship but the pressure ramps up for the final drop spot, with Leeds favourites to finish in 18th (46 per cent), followed by Everton (31 per cent) and Burnley (23 per cent).

On Monday night, the Cottagers thrashed Luton 7-0 at home to clinch the Championship title after they had made automatic promotion safe earlier this month with victory over Preston. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player After spending 13 consecutive seasons in the Premier League between 2001-2014, Fulham's fortunes have been somewhat less stable in recent years, with their last five campaigns ending in either promotion or relegation. No one can question Fulham's bounce-back ability. The pattern is consistent. Relegation woe is followed by the joy of immediate promotion. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  And once again it's only taken the London outfit one season of Championship football to realise their potential as a first-tier club, but questions over their longevity remain. Here we look at how Fulham can ditch their yo-yo past in favour of a sustained run as a genuine Premier League entity. Having won the Championship with a game to spare, Fulham boss Marco Silva will have one eye, or possibly even two, on next season. Fulham seal return to PL Championship table Get NOW TV - save more than 25% Live football on Sky Sports this week In Silva, Fulham have a leader with Premier League knowhow. In both top-flight forays of recent memory, they have been led by managers who lacked such experience. His Premier League win percentage (35.71) may be somewhat underwhelming, but counts for something given his predecessors - Slavisa Jokanovic and Scott Parker - started their respective top-flight campaigns on zero. Fulham have also led the Championship since mid-January and despite suffering a delay to their promotion parade with a few rogue results - notably against Coventry City and Derby County - have known their fate for weeks. Fulham have tried spending heavily with limited success in the past and will need to be shrewd operators in the summer transfer market to ensure they boost their squad in the areas they lack most. This time around, with automatic promotion secure without the need for the play-offs, Fulham are ahead of the competing pack. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  That security may pave the way for player trading earlier in the window and offer any newcomers more time to bed in. Fulham's recruitment policy has been flawed in recent years and relied too heavily at times on loanees. They splurged over £100m on 12 players ahead of 2018/19, before being forced into the January market for a short-term fix in an attempt to save their ill-fated season. A more considered plan of attack, which centres around two or three key targets in specific areas of weakness, as well as some pragmatic fine-tuning to the current squad will provide a better platform for success - this model has been well executed by both Leeds and Brentford over recent seasons. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Aleksandar Mitrovic is undoubtedly Fulham's talisman, although question marks remain over his Premier League suitability. Regardless, Silva appears to know how to get the best out of his record-breaking striker. He is thriving in a settled system guided by Silva's dynamic style. In March, Mitrovic broke Ivan Toney's Championship scoring record by notching his 32nd and 33rd league goals of the season in a win over Peterborough. In Monday night's win over Luton, the 27-year-old broke Guy Whittingham's second-tier record of 42 goals in a single 46-game campaign with his two second-half strikes taking him onto 43 for the season with a game to play. There is a very clear correlation between Mitrovic's bounty and Fulham's fortunes. In 2020/21, the striker scored more international goals for Serbia (7) than he did at club level (4), as Fulham were relegated having only found the net 27 times all season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It's clear that under Silva, Mitrovic has much more potency. He has got better at coming deep and linking play and is much more of a complete forward, registering a further seven assists. It's also no surprise that Fulham possess the league's most abundant provider in Harry Wilson - 19 assists. In order to dictate the outcome of games in the Premier League, Fulham need to figure out a formula that puts their prized asset, who was named Championship Player of the Season, at the centre of the action. Championship winners tend to fare better than play-off winners - although Norwich City remain an exception to that rule. Fulham must therefore harness the momentum gathered from such a successful season and put it to good use in the early part of the new term. Leeds, Wolves and Burnley are all examples of clubs who have won the Championship title in recent years and exhibited staying power in the top-flight by profiting from the promotion wave. This does not last forever - as demonstrated by Sheffield United's second season demise - but could serve to energise a positive start. The same impetus applies to individuals. There will be a void left by teenage sensation Fabio Carvalho - who is set to depart for Liverpool in the summer - but among Fulham's Premier League 2 (Division 2) title-winning youngsters there is a clear abundance of talent to supplement the quality within the first team. The carryover must also extend to Fulham's stellar strike force. If Mitrovic and Wilson can hit the same heights and deliver a comparable amount of firepower in the Premier League, it's entirely reasonable to forecast Fulham's stay in the top tier to extend beyond a single season. Plenty of ifs, buts and maybes, but there are certainly grounds for cautious optimism. Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

How Premier League could have nine teams in European competitions next season,"The race for Europe is on but which teams make it - and how many - is still to be decided. With the Premier League campaign reaching its climax, we look at: There are seven European spots open to English sides - although that number could rise to nine and the amount of teams in each individual competition can shift. As a basis: However, because this season the FA Cup winner will be either Liverpool or Chelsea, and both those teams look set to finish in the top four, their Europa League qualifying spot for winning the FA Cup will be passed down to the next highest Premier League finisher who doesn't qualify for Europe. Similarly, because Liverpool won the Carabao Cup and are set to finish in the top four, their Europa Conference League qualifying spot from that competition will go to the next highest Premier League finisher without European football. So that means sides which finish sixth and seventh in the Premier League table are in contention for a place in either the Europa League or Europa Conference League next season. Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal would qualify for the Champions League by finishing in the Premier League's top four positions. Tottenham would go into the Europa League, along with Manchester United (who would get in thanks to Chelsea or Liverpool passing on their spot from winning the FA Cup). Seventh-placed West Ham would qualify for the Europa Conference League, thanks to Liverpool's Carabao Cup winner's spot being passed on. Manchester City and Liverpool have pulled clear at the top of the Premier League, and while their battle to win the Premier League title continues, they don't have to worry about Champions League qualification. Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp will still be plotting how to win this year's competition, and could meet in the final, but they already have their places in next season's tournament wrapped up through the league. Meanwhile, the last two spots in the top four are still up for grabs with Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham in contention with four games remaining. However, whatever the outcome, it will be a top-six finish at the very least for Chelsea and Arsenal, who return to European competition after missing out last season. Although not mathematically done yet, Spurs have all but guaranteed a Europa League spot with a nine-point gap between them and seventh-placed West Ham, who have just three matches left to play this season. Antonio Conte's side also have a far superior goal difference to the Hammers. The battle for the final Europa League spot continues between Man Utd and West Ham, while Wolves also have their eyes on finishing seventh and potentially securing a place in the Europa Conference League. If Manchester City or Liverpool win the Champions League they will automatically qualify for the competition's group stages next season. That is irrespective of where they finish in the Premier League table. If they qualify for the competition through two methods - ie: they win it and finish in the top four - there is no extra Champions League spot created for another team to fill and the number of Premier League clubs in next season's Champions League will remain at four. The Premier League could have a maximum of five teams in the Champions League next season, though, if West Ham won the Europa League and finished outside the top four. Winning that competition qualifies them for the Champions League group stages. If Leicester win the Europa Conference League they will automatically qualify for next season's Europa League - another additional European spot. That means, if West Ham and Leicester win their competitions and finish outside the Premier League's top seven there will be nine English sides in European competition next season. The nine sides would be: the top four and West Ham in the Champions League, fifth and sixth place, plus Leicester, in the Europa League, and seventh place in the Europa Conference League. But if Leicester were to win the Europa Conference League and finish seventh - the place set to be rewarded with a Europa Conference League spot - there would be no English side in the Europa Conference League next season, as Leicester would be bumped up to the Europa League. That happened in Spain last season with Sevilla and no La Liga side involved in the Europa Conference League. With Liverpool and Manchester City in the Champions League semi-finals, there's a good chance an English side would win the tournament - but that would have no impact on European qualification, with both sides set to finish in the top four. West Ham are into the semis of the Europa League and an additional Champions League spot is up for grabs if they win that competition. Their Europa Conference League spot for finishing seventh would disappear.Leicester - 10 points off seventh with two games in hand - could be playing European football again next year if they progress from their semi-final and win the Europa Conference League to earn an additional spot in the Europa League. Regardless of any permutation, no side finishing eighth in the Premier League will qualify for Europe, unless they've won a domestic or European cup. Eighth-placed Wolves would be the highest-finishing Premier League team to miss out on European football, although they are just three points behind West Ham and five off Manchester United, with a game in hand on both.

INCIDENT: Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale races off his line to make an interception, seeming to catch Jarrod Bowen in the process, but the West Ham forward is booked for simulation. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player VERDICT: Yellow card for 'diving' is harsh. DERMOT SAY: ""The outcome of this was actually a yellow card for Jarrod Bowen for simulation. ""People talk about this incident and say: 'Is it a red-card offence from the goalkeeper?' ""For a red-card offence, it would have to be serious foul play. I'm not saying he didn't go to take the player. He wants to stop the player, there is no doubt about that. ""It's very difficult to send a player off when there is no contact made for a serious foul play offence. I wouldn't say it is impossible, but it is very difficult. Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League table ""On balance, I think the best decision would probably be no yellow card for simulation. Let's accept the goalkeeper went rashly, if you like, the player took evasive action, but he didn't simulate."" Gallagher added: ""I don't think a player has to suffer serious injury for it to be a serious offence. ""I do think it is very difficult to pull out a red card for a player who hasn't made contact with another player. I don't say impossible, but it is very difficult. ""On this occasion, the goalkeeper was rash. He took a risk. The goalkeeper has in his mind that he's got to stop the player and I think he's got lucky. ""Bowen had to evade him, there is no doubt about it, and that is why I think no yellow card. If the referee had just given a throw-in, I think that'd be more acceptable. Bowen is the one I feel sorry for. I'm very glad he didn't suffer injury, but he was unlucky to get a booking."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Warnock: Ramsdale's rash. Stephen Warnock on Sky Sports News: ""Ramsdale's rash ""I think it is a foul by Ramsdale because of the speed in which he comes out. Bowen has to ride the tackle and naturally he's going to lose his balance. I don't think it is a red card but Ramsdale's rash, which tells you it is a foul."" Smith: No Bowen booking, but Ramsdale's lucky Sue Smith on Sky Sports News: ""It's a really interesting debate. I don't think Bowen should have been booked for it because as a player, when you are running through at so much pace, you knock the ball around and you see the challenge coming in. You see Ramsdale coming at you with so much pace and you do everything to avoid it because you don't want to get injured. ""He certainly shouldn't have got a yellow card for that and I'm more in favour that it should have been a foul by Ramsdale, even though he didn't make contact. That's where the dilemma is because he's very lucky he didn't connect with him because if he did it would've been a definite red card.""

There's no doubt about that because the game goes on. ""The ball may have touched his arm, but it wasn't deemed a handball because it was totally accidental. The referee quite rightly says play on. ""If the ball strikes you on the arm, it has to be deliberate, or your arm has to be above your shoulder and in the air.

DERMOT SAYS: ""I would suggest the referee has sent it straight to the FA. In his match report after the game, he's contacted the FA and said: 'This has been drawn to my attention. You need to look at this.' ""As you've said, it has already unfolded that the FA are to investigate it and we'll see what happens after that."" When asked about the procedure with the ref having a lot to remember, Dermot added: ""That's the benefit of the fourth official. The fourth official will coordinate everything for him, they will talk after the match and put the report in based on what they've seen together. ""It's about accumulating as much information as you can, relaying it to the FA, and the FA dealing with it. ""The referee would have to be convinced that it is a danger to a spectator, if he's thrown it into the crowd like that. It doesn't show where it went. We saw an incident years ago where Jamie Carragher was sent off for throwing a coin back into the fans at Arsenal once in the FA Cup. ""He got sent off that day, but it is rare and I think the best procedure really is for the referee to leave it to the FA because they are in charge of discipline.""

""If a penalty is given, I don't think he's got a lot of argument. ""As it was, I don't think the referee saw it and the VAR wasn't convinced so it was play-on, but I think he was lucky. ""VAR wasn't convinced because it is a subjective decision. Has the ball struck his arm? Has he moved his arm into it? I think because of the way he is turning his body he's moved towards the ball. Other people say no. ""There were four people in the studio on Sunday and two thought penalty and two thought no. That's where you are."" 'Son's body language points to penalty' Stephen Warnock on Sky Sports News: ""I think it's a penalty and what you can also see from the incident is, Son's under no pressure when that ball drops to him once he's handled it and it drops at his feet. ""Now he knows he's clear of Ayoze Perez but look at him lash at the ball. It's almost like he's saying he's made a mistake and that's a natural reaction when you think you've done something wrong. You panic. ""If he's thinking I haven't handled the ball I think he'd have run with it out of the box. Body language comes into it again, but I think it's a penalty."" 'Son's arm is close to his body' Sue Smith on Sky Sports News: ""I think this is where subjectivity comes in because I don't think it is a penalty. ""I think his arm is quite close to his body and he just gets in between. The ball does touch his arm but I don't think he's actually moved his arm to the ball.""

Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp's sides look destined to remain almost neck-and-neck until the very end of the Premier League season for the second time in four years with both sides victorious on Saturday, to leave City a point ahead in the standings with four games remaining. Both sides rested players due to their Champions League semi-final commitments but after a Mo Salah-less Liverpool edged to a 1-0 win at Newcastle in the lunchtime kick-off, Manchester City saw off a Leeds side unbeaten in five games with a 4-0 victory at Elland Road to leapfrog them back to the top of the table, despite making five changes from their match with Real Madrid in midweek. Neville told the Gary Neville Podcast the two teams had transformed the title race from the ""fights"" of his time as a player at Manchester United into a spectacle both appear to enjoy, with the increasing pressure of keeping up with their title rival never showing - and the prospect of a faultless end to the season a real possibility. He said: ""The thing that actually City have done tonight, which is massively impressive, but they make it look easy, is that when we were up against the team going for a title and they played before us, we always wanted to play first. ""When Liverpool have gone and done what they did at lunchtime today at Newcastle, after Villarreal in midweek and all the games they've had recently, you're thinking that switches the pressure to City, but you never really get the impression that these two teams feel that pressure.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Neville felt both Klopp and Guardiola took a chance by making changes for Saturday's Premier League matches - but says to have come through unscathed will be of huge benefit to both teams in the remaining games this season, with fringe players feeling more confident and ready to make an impact off the bench in pivotal moments. ""What Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola are doing today is, they're basically empowering the squad,"" said Neville. ""You hear managers say 'I've got a great squad', but have you got the guts and the courage to really use that squad in big matches where you need to win? ""Where you know if you don't win there is a large consequence, or you're probably going to lose a league title, or you're going to get knocked out of a European Cup competition. So to do it and then come out of it and win - you've empowered everybody. ""You've made everybody feel part of it, and the strength in that squad and the commitment of everybody means that you start to blend into the feeling of every three days, you know everyone's had a game, no one feels like there's a first eleven. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It's a real mistake to name your first eleven, then always play that first eleven in modern football, if you're going to go for three and four trophies because you're going to need those five and six and seven on the bench. And so to keep them included to make them feel part of it, get them on the pitch if you can, even it's for 10 or 15 minutes at the end. ""It's really critical that you make everybody feel proud of being part of the squad because there is absolute certainty there is going to come a game that will catch you out, and you're going to need two or three subs to come on and save you. That could be a defensive sub, it could be an attacking sub as well more often than not. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""We had it in the Champions League final, where we had two subs come off the bench and win it for us. Liverpool have that in them, Manchester City have that in them, but you need to keep those players in form, confident, fit, part of it, energised. Making them feel like they're contributing to the success, and it's not just a token gesture where you're being played in the sort of weak games."" ""It's the first time Jurgen Klopp's left Mo Salah out in what feels like an absolute age, but he must have felt that was a game that he could leave him out in. Why he thought that, we don't know. But when I saw that, I thought, 'Right, what message does that send to the rest of the Liverpool players?'. ""I just thought because he's played Salah in every game, the game that he leaves Salah out in, I thought would be a risk because it tells the rest of the players something. I just thought there was a risk there when I saw the team news come through. I thought that's a test for the other players because they know this guy is going to come straight back in against Villarreal. They know he's number one. So can we get through without him? ""So those Liverpool players come off today getting through without him, and City have got through without De Bruyne, and I think that's the two best players - I think Van Dijk competes with Salah in terms of importance - but those are the two star players.

https://www.sportbible.com/football/luis-garcia-scored-ghost-goal-against-chelsea-on-this-day-in-2005-20220503,Luis Garcia Scored His Famous 'Ghost Goal' For Liverpool Against Chelsea On This Day In 2005,"It's 17 years to the day since Luis Garcia scored his famous 'ghost goal' against Chelsea and fans are still not sure whether the ball crossed the line. Garcia's goal sent Liverpool through to the 2005 Champions League final in Istanbul, where they would come from three goals down to beat AC Milan on penalties in one of the greatest games in history. Liverpool could book their place in yet another Champions League final this evening if they beat Villarreal in the second leg of their semi-final tie, with Jurgen Klopp's side holding a 2-0 lead from the first leg at Anfield. Loadingâ¦ Back in 2005, it was Chelsea who were Liverpool's opponents in the last four of the competition. The first leg at Stamford Bridge had ended in a goalless draw to leave the tie delicately poised heading into the second leg at Anfield. And it burst into life just four minutes into the reverse fixture on Merseyside. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard played a chipped through-ball over the top of the Chelsea defence, which striker Milan Baros attempted to reach before Blues goalkeeper Petr Cech. Baros managed to get a touch on the ball before being brought down by Cech in front of the Kop. #OnThisDay in 2005, @luchogarcia14 sent us to Istanbul ð pic.twitter.com/eBNbIm4fPN As the home fans pleaded for a penalty and a red card, Garcia latched onto the loose ball and directed a shot towards goal which deflected off Chelsea captain John Terry. William Gallas raced back towards goal to make a desperate clearance on the line as Garcia wheeled away in celebration. After a few moments of confusion, the Slovakian referee Lubos Michel signalled that the goal had been given, sending Anfield into a state of euphoria. Rafael Benitez's side would go on to grind out a 1-0 aggregate win to book their place in the final in Istanbul. The goal remains hugely controversial to this day, with Chelsea and Liverpool fans in disagreement over whether the ball crossed the line. Chelsea's manager that day, Jose Mourinho, dubbed it the ""ghost goal"" after the match and insisted it should not have been given. ""It was a goal that came from the moon â from the Anfield stands,"" Mourinho said at the time. ""I felt the power of Anfield, it was magnificent. I felt it didn't interfere with my players but maybe it interfered with other people and maybe it interfered with the result."" A post shared by Luis Garcia (@luchogarcia14) Mourinho doubled down on those claims in 2019, telling beIN Sports: ""Anfield is a magic place to play, it is a beautiful place to play. ""They can even score goals that the players don't score, like it happened in 2005. ""It wasn't Garcia that scored the goal, it was the crowd that scored the goal, but now it isnât possible with VAR and goal-line technology."" Should the goal have been given?

""This is a question you need to ask Erik ten Hag,"" Rangnick told Sky Sports when asked about the forward's future. ""Heâs showed that he can still be a vital part of this team, but itâs obvious the team needs some more strikers. There should be two or three new strikers next season, itâs pretty obvious.

""They strengthened the team, they brought in players not that popular at the time when they signed and developed into the two best teams in the world.

Former Watford boss Mazzarri was dismissed by Cagliari on Monday with the club 17th in the table, two points outside the relegation zone with three games remaining in the season. A one sentence statement announcing his dismissal was released on the club's website, which read: ""Cagliari Calcio announces that it has relieved Walter Mazzarri from his post as first-team coach.ï»¿"" However, Mazzarri could technically remain employed by Cagliari until 2024 because of a bizarre clause that is rumoured to be in his contract. In September, Mazzarri signed a new deal with the club which reportedly included the clause that stated he would have his contract extended until 2024 if he was dismissed from his role while the club was outside the relegation zone. Despite losing 2-1 to Verona on Saturday, Cagliari remain outside the bottom three after 18th-place Salernitana were held to a 1-1 draw at Atalanta on Monday.

Meanwhile, Mazzarri â who was linked with Liverpool before Jurgen Klopp's arrival on Merseyside â is set to go on gardening leave.

Keane, 50, captained United during the most successful period in the club's history, winning seven Premier League titles and the Champions League in 13 trophy-laden seasons at Old Trafford. Ahead of Monday's Premier League match between United and Brentford, Keane was asked to pick his best United XI from the modern era. Loadingâ¦ In goal, Keane selected Peter Schmeichel ahead of Edwin van der Sar and David De Gea, despite claiming the fiery Dane ""wasn't as good"" as everyone thought. He then picked Dennis Irwin at left-back and Gary Neville at right-back, before naming Jaap Stam and Gary Pallister as his preferred centre-back pairing. Explaining his decision to pick Pallister over the likes of Ferdinand, Steve Bruce and Nemanja Vidic, Keane said on Sky Sports: ""The other one was an issue but I have gone with Gary Pallister. Brucey was a brilliant player but you have to leave someone out. ""Rio was obviously a good athlete and read the game well but my relationship with Pally was pretty good as well. ""Certain lads at United go out of their way to help you. He was obviously a very good player. Always looked exhausted but I would have him in there."" Keane modestly chose to leave himself out of the side, instead selecting former United captain Bryan Robson in central midfield. ""Robson has to go in there. Bryan was a great player for Manchester United, full of courage and scored some big goals for Manchester United when the club was not at its best,"" added Keane. Surprisingly, Keane then selected Paul Ince to pair Robson in central midfield, snubbing former teammate Paul Scholes. ""Incey was a very good player, maybe tarnished his United reputation with him playing for Liverpool or whatever,"" added Keane. ""There is a lot of talk about Incey being the 'Guv'nor' and that was held against him but that was just banter. There was no nastiness with that. Incey was a really good teammate and I thought he was a very good player. ""It was tough leaving Scholesy out and [Nicky] Butt, brilliant players and brilliant characters. But I just thought Incey in that first season I was there, when we won the double, he was brilliant in midfield. ""He was a good team-mate to have next to you in the trenches."" Keane completed his midfield with Ryan Giggs on the left wing and David Beckham on the right. And up front, he named Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo as his two strikers, leaving out the likes of Eric Cantona, Andy Cole, Dwight Yorke and Ruud van Nistelrooy.

Foden rotates with a number of elite forwards in the City frontline and has eight league goals, while Salah is Liverpool's talisman and currently leads the Golden Boot race with 22 goals in the league. Crouch thinks Foden should win the award over Salah and teammate Kevin De Bruyne if City end the season as Premier League and Champions League winners. He wrote in his Daily Mail column: ""This year, if Manchester City win the Premier League and Champions League, you would have to pick Phil Foden or Kevin De Bruyne. Iâd potentially go for Foden because he has consistently been a shining light for them. ""There are plenty of others you could choose and the same goes for Liverpool. ""The performances of Virgil van Dijk have been an absolute joke. Sadio Mane as well, coming back from winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal and picking up where he left off. He has to be in the conversation. ""I do seem to be skirting around the fact that Mo Salah â already crowned FWA Footballer of the Year â has the most goals and assists this season. ""Clearly he has to be in there, given how electric he has been throughout the campaign, even allowing for him going off the boil slightly in recent weeks."" Salah's goal tally has decreased in 2022 but he's still one of Jurgen Klopp's most consistent performers. The Reds still have a historic quadruple in their sights and Crouch concluded if City and Liverpool share the spoils, it has to be Salah. He continued: ""Those five names are my list and it has to be one of them. If the two clubs trade trophies, Salah pips the others in my view for his sheer weight of goal contributions."" Liverpool ran out 1-0 winners over Newcastle United on Saturday afternoon to temporarily go top of the league. Pep Guardiola's men responded by thrashing Leeds United 4-0 later in the day to return to the summit. Both teams have four games left and know any slip-up will be costly. They'll resume their league campaigns next weekend, with the second leg of their respective Champions League semi-finals coming up. City are set for a blockbuster encounter at the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday after beating Real Madrid 4-3, while Liverpool take a 2-0 lead to Villarreal on Wednesday. ",positive,Liverpool,6

Loadingâ¦ A miserable season at Old Trafford will come to end on Monday night, as United play their final home game, ahead of two away fixtures. Fans have only seen their team win nine times in the league in Manchester so far this season, which is actually an improvement on their away form, and the end of the campaign probably can't come soon enough. When the final whistle is blown following the game against Thomas Frank's team the players are set to take a lap of honour, or give a lap of appreciation to the fans, depending on how it's spun. A group of fans will miss the gesture however, as there is a planned walkout 17 minutes from the end of the match, to protest the 17 years the club has been under American ownership from the Glazer family. In recent games the 17 minutes of not being in their seats has come before kick off but the Brentford match protests are planned for the final part of the game. Whilst the club are aware that the players might not get the best reception during their lap, there are several players playing in front of the home fans for the last time. Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata's contracts are both expiring, so could play their last minutes at Old Trafford, whilst Paul Pogba and Edinson Cavani are in the same situation but injured. Nemanja Matic has also revealed that he wants to leave in the summer, and others are expected to depart with the arrival of Erik ten Hag likely to lead to a clearout. Some players may get a warm reception but Pogba, whose future isn't sorted yet, was recently booed when coming off in the game against Norwich City. Monday's game comes a year after the club's fans had their most 'successful' protest against the owners, as they managed to get a game with Liverpool postponed. Thousands gathered outside of Old Trafford, whilst games were still being played behind closed doors due to Covid, and hundreds even got onto the pitch. There were also protests outside of the hotels the two sets of players were gathered at, stopping the clubs getting to the match, and it was played at a later date.

Loadingâ¦ The Toffees were in desperate need of all three points at Goodison Park, as Frank Lampard welcomed his former team amidst a tough relegation battle. Burnley's back-to-back wins had left Everton five points from safety and looking like a first relegation since 1951, and with games running out it was becoming a major worry. Richarlison put his side 1-0 up just a minute after the second half begun, pouncing on Cesar Azpilicueta's mistake and slotting past Edouard Mendy, to rapturous scenes from the home supporters. Flares were thrown onto the pitch by the fans, with the forward picking one up and lobbing it back towards the stands, with the FA opening an investigation. DEADLOCK BROKEN! ð¥Richarlison picks the pocket of Azpilicueta on the edge of his own area and cooly slots the ball past Mendy! ð pic.twitter.com/P0VEFoeDi4 At the time fans on social media felt the 24-year-old could have been sent off but Everton claimed the player was looking to get rid of the flare but away from the fans. ""We will look into the matter,"" the club said. ""As far we we are concerned, Richarlison was attempting to throw it out of the ground."" The club and the FA will both investigate the issue, with the FA having previously written to Liverpool's Harvey Elliott earlier this season when he handled a flare. That came in the Carabao Cup final win on penalties, also against Chelsea, with the 19-year-old picking up the flare before putting it back down again. In 2009 Didier Drogba was cautioned by the police after throwing a coin back into the crowd, after a Burnley fan had thrown it in his direction whilst he was celebrating a goal against the Clarets. As well as Richarlison's goal, Lampard and Everton were grateful for Jordan Pickford's brilliant performance in goal, somehow saving from Azpilicueta's shot, after the initial chance had left the goalkeeper on the other side of the goal. The Merseyside team are now just two points below both Leeds and Burnley, with the former dropping below the Clarets after recent results. They have a game in hand and next travel to Leicester City and then Watford, although they have not won an away game in the league since August. ",positive,Liverpool,1

When asked during a Q&A if there was any update on Mane and Firmino's contract situations, Doyle responded: ""Nothing yet. In fact, I doubt there'll be much on contracts now until the season has finished. It isn't a priority right now as the focus is now completely on winning games and winning trophies.

Tielemans has remained an integral cog in the Leicester engine room this season, and he is not expected to be short of suitors if he seeks a move away from the FA Cup holders. The likes of Liverpool, Real Madrid and Man United have all been credited with an interest in the Belgium international, while Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur have also been linked with summer swoops. Despite reported interest from a wide range of Premier League clubs, journalist Sacha Tavolieiri has put Real Madrid on red alert by claiming that Tielemans has his heart set on a move to La Liga. © Reuters ""While he should leave Leicester City this summer, Youri Tielemans would have told those around him his preference for a departure to Spain,"" Tavolieri tweeted. ""The Real Madrid, interested, could position itself concretely in the coming weeks... To be continued."" Real Madrid are not short of midfield options at present having secured the signature of Eduardo Camavinga, while Luka Modric has also allegedly agreed to stay on for at least one more season. However, with Modric now approaching the final knockings of his career while Toni Kroos and Casemiro continue in their 30s, Real boss Carlo Ancelotti could plan for the future with 24-year-old Tielemans alongside Camavinga and Federico Valverde. Real are understood to have enquired about Tielemans's availability in the January transfer window but decided against a move when learning of the Belgium international's £50m price tag. Manchester United's midfield is also expected to undergo a major overhaul this summer, with Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba expected to depart as free agents at the end of their contracts. Tielemans is expected to be one of several targets on the Red Devils' wishlist this summer, with a recent report claiming that James Ward-Prowse was also being eyed up by Erik ten Hag. © Reuters Tielemans initially arrived on loan at the King Power Stadium for the second half of the 2018-19 season and was immediately snapped up on a permanent deal after providing three goals and five assists in those six months. The former Anderlecht youngster has since gone on to register 24 goals and 23 assists in 153 appearances for Rodgers's side, including the winning goal in the final of last season's FA Cup against Chelsea. Tielemans's statistics this season include seven goals and four assists from 44 matches continentally and domestically, with six of those strikes coming in Premier League action. However, with the Europa Conference League semi-final second leg with Roma in mind, Tielemans was only brought off the bench for the final 14 minutes of Sunday's 3-1 loss to Tottenham Hotspur. Tielemans's feats in the 2020-21 campaign also saw him rewarded with the club's Player of the Season accolade, but his contract situation could supposedly lead to Leicester to consider bids in the region of £25m this summer.

Should Real Madrid pull off a deal for Mbappe, the Ligue 1 champions will be eyeing a replacement for the 23-year-old, as well as soon-to-be free agent Angel Di Maria. Now, The Telegraph reports that Liverpool will consider selling Salah in the upcoming market if he fails to commit his future to the club, and he could be tempted by a move to PSG.

""My relationship with both players is great. If it's a positive sign for the boys then great, but I don't think this will be a decisive factor.

Dortmund's 120m euros (£108m) asking price for Sancho has been a key issue in recent months while sporting director Michael Zorc told reporters on Saturday that ""the door is closed"", which seems to bring an end to speculation.  United are highly likely to strengthen their forward line with the capture of veteran Uruguayan Edinson Cavani following his release by Paris St Germain, but other areas of concern for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer may go unaddressed.  They had been linked with Gareth Bale before he ultimately plumped for a return to Spurs, where Alli seems to be surplus to requirements having not played in the top flight since their season-opening defeat to Everton.  PSG have already had one offer rejected and have been tipped to make a follow-up loan bid for the 24-year-old, who has been left out of Gareth Southgate's England squad for the fixtures against Wales, Belgium and Denmark. Dele Alli was not included in England's latest squad for their three fixtures in October (Jonathan Brady/PA) Arsenal could raid Chelsea for the second time this summer. Having signed Willian on a free transfer, Gunners boss Mikel Arteta is out to boost his midfield options and Jorginho is reported to fit the bill.  Even though Frank Lampard has strengthened in the middle of the park by signing Hakim Ziyech and Kai Havertz – with Ben Chilwell, Edouard Mendy and Timo Werner also joining in big-money moves – the Blues head coach may be reluctant to let go of a player who has twice captained the side this season.  Manchester City's stuttering start to the campaign might see them make a late foray into the transfer market for a new left-back, with Bayern Munich's David Alaba and Ajax's Nicolas Tagliafico among those being apparently courted.  Champions Liverpool are rumoured to be eyeing a last-gasp swoop for Dembele but having added Diogo Jota, Thiago Alcantara and Kostas Tsimikas to their ranks, Jurgen Klopp is probably satisfied with his lot.  Merseyside rivals Everton are bracing themselves for bids for Moise Kean, allegedly attracting interest from PSG and former club Juventus, but his departure could pave the way for Arkadiusz Milik to join the Toffees from Napoli. Sean Dyche's Burnley are yet to record a point in the Premier League this season (Martin Rickett/PA) Leeds, who have made a whirlwind start in their first top-flight campaign in 16 years, are supposed to be closing in on Rennes winger Raphinha while Norwich's Todd Cantwell is also a priority for the Elland Road club.  Burnley, without a point from their opening four matches, have seen Jeff Hendrick, Aaron Lennon and Joe Hart all leave Turf Moor and their only outfield signing so far has been Dale Stephens from Brighton.  Manager Sean Dyche has made plain the need for reinforcements but may, in fact, be relieved to see the window shut with West Ham and Leicester sniffing around centre-half James Tarkowski.

Bellingham still has more than three years left to run on his current deal, but there is currently a host of speculation surrounding his future, with many of the world's biggest clubs thought to be keen to sign him. According to Goal, Liverpool are planning to bring in a new central midfielder during this summer's transfer window and view Bellingham as the ideal acquisition. The report claims that Monaco's Aurelien Tchouameni is also 'admired', as head coach Jurgen Klopp looks to boost his options for the 2022-23 campaign. Bellingham is allegedly valued by Dortmund in the region of €100m (£84m), but a recent report claimed that the Bundesliga outfit had no interest in selling him in the upcoming market.

Qualification for the Champions League would help to boost Arsenal's coffers, and Arteta's side currently sit two points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur in the table before Sunday's fixtures commence. A plethora of attacking targets have already been mooted after Arsenal missed out on the signature of Dusan Vlahovic in January, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Gabriel Jesus and Darwin Nunez all mentioned. Arsenal have supposedly already agreed to sign Manchester City's Jesus in a £42m deal, but Arteta has warned Gooners not to expect his side to fork out mammoth fees on one player like Liverpool did for Alisson Becker and Virgil van Dijk. ""I don't think we are in a position where we can do that, so we have to find other ways to do it,"" Arteta told Sky Sports News when questioned on Liverpool's big-money defensive signings. © Reuters ""Liverpool, as well, have improved their players immensely, which is as important as bringing players in. And then, the ones that you buy, [it's important] that they can have an impact straight away. ""That's a big decision they have to make in recruitment, and then they are human beings as well. They have to adapt, and sometimes that's a tricky question to answer before they are actually here. ""We want to make the squad stronger, we want to make the starting XI stronger, we want to make the specificity and the personality of our players stronger, and that's what we are going to be seeking to do. ""It will depend on many factors - how many players are back from their loans, with the commitments we still have with them; our financial position in relation to where we finish; the clubs' demands when we want to buy players or sell players. There are a lot of question marks there, but this is football."" A new central midfielder could also be on the agenda for Arsenal with Mohamed Elneny now less than two months away from becoming a free agent, but the Egypt international has impressed with showings against Chelsea and Manchester United in the past couple of weeks. © Reuters Elneny has confirmed his desire to sign a new contract at Arsenal, even if he remains a bit-part player under Arteta, who has also admitted that the ex-Basel man does not always get the credit he feels he deserves. Kieran Tierney's long-term injury and Nuno Tavares's hit-and-miss campaign could also lead Arsenal to move for a new left-back in the summer market, and Bologna's Aaron Hickey is also thought to be on their wanted list. However, the Scottish teenager - who supposedly possesses a €20m (£16.7m) price tag - is also rumoured to have attracted interest from Italian heavyweights Juventus, AC Milan and Napoli ahead of the summer window. Matteo Guendouzi, Lucas Torreira, Hector Bellerin, Konstantinos Mavropanos and Pablo Mari could also head elsewhere following the completion of their loan deals, but William Saliba is understood to have decided against a permanent move to Marseille as he fights for his spot in the defence alongside Ben White and Gabriel Magalhaes. Arsenal could temporarily drop out of the top four if Tottenham get the better of Leicester City on Sunday but will attempt to usurp their North London rivals when they meet West Ham United later in the day.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/cristiano-ronaldo-future-man-utd-ralf-rangnick-b997571.html,Cristiano Ronaldo drops strong hint over Manchester United future amid Ralf Rangnick backing,"ristiano Ronaldo has seemingly hinted that he will be staying at Manchester United this summer. The Portugese superstar’s two-year contract at Old Trafford is not set to expire until June 2023, yet there has been fierce debate over recent months as to whether he should leave for a second time at the end of the season. While Ronaldo has proved United’s saviour on plenty of occasions with 24 goals in 38 appearances across all competitions this term, many have questioned his place in what is expected to be a drastic rebuild of the ailing Red Devils under new permanent manager Erik ten Hag. However, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner appeared to strongly hint that he would be staying put after again enjoying a starring role against Brentford in the Premier League on Monday night. Ronaldo is now only four strikes behind Liverpool leader Mohamed Salah in the Golden Boot race after dispatching a second-half penalty in the morale-boosting 3-0 victory over Brentford. He had earlier seen an initial effort ruled out for offside before the interval. Cristiano Ronaldo enjoyed a starring role again for Manchester United in their 3-0 win over Brentford After emphatically scoring his spot-kick, Ronaldo pointed to himself and then down to the Old Trafford turf, seemingly indicating that he may be staying after all. Then, while soaking up the adulation of the fans during a post-match lap of honour to mark the last home match of a difficult United campaign, he appeared to mouth to the Sky Sports cameras: “I’m not finished.” Interim boss Ralf Rangnick insisted once again after the win over Brentford that any decision on Ronaldo’s future should be deferred to Ten Hag, yet he backed the 37-year-old to remain part of the squad despite his repeated claims that United will need to sign at least two top-class strikers this summer. “The way we played again tonight, not only because he scored he also won the penalty and helped defensively, why should he not be part of the squad and help the team?” said Rangnick. “But this is a question you have to ask Erik and also Cristiano. “Cristiano is not a central striker. He does not want to play in that position but if you look at international football there are not many teams who play with two strikers. “For me, it is a question of what players Manchester United have in the future. It is obvious United need two more quality strikers. Modern strikers do not necessarily have to be strikers. Liverpool or Manchester City have five or six top-class strikers. If you ask me if Gabriel Jesus or Jack Grealish is a winger or a striker, they can all play there. “Mason Greenwood would have been one, then after the West Ham game he was no longer part of the squad. Anthony Martial was on loan and Edinson Cavani injured.” ",positive,Liverpool,2

A relatively routine 2-0 victory at Anfield has Jurgen Klopp’s side strong favourites to progress, even despite Unai Emery’s excellence in European competition. The quadruple is very much still on for Liverpool and, barring the kind of turnaround not often seen before in Champions League history, they will soon be in their third cup final of the campaign.

The quadruple-chasing Reds travel to eastern Spain holding a commanding 2-0 lead in their last-four tie after a Pervis Estupinan own goal and Sadio Mane’s second-half effort in a one-sided first leg at Anfield last week. However, manager Jurgen Klopp is not taking anything for granted on the road to Paris, insisting it is a difficult scoreline as Unai Emery pledged to make his side “suffer” in Tuesday’s return clash. Liverpool followed up that dominant win over Villarreal in which they held 73 per cent of the overall possession and allowed only one shot (which was off-target) by triumphing at Newcastle on Saturday, with Naby Keita’s fourth goal of the season in the early Premier League kick-off ensuring they piled the pressure on title rivals Manchester City, who responded with a routine 3-0 victory at Leeds later in the day to regain top spot with four games to go. Much-changed Villarreal, meanwhile, slumped to a disappointing 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Alaves at the weekend, leaving them seventh in LaLiga, four points adrift of the top six and nine behind Atletico Madrid in fourth. Their hopes of playing in Europe at all next season could well now rest on pulling off an incredible comeback against six-time champions Liverpool and winning the whole competition, with either Real Madrid or Manchester City awaiting the winners of this tie in the final at the Stade de France on May 28. Liverpool vs Villarreal is scheduled for an 8pm BST kick-off on Tuesday May 3, 2022. The match will take place at the Estadio de la Ceramica - better known as El Madrigal - in Villarreal, Spain.

Liverpool will remain without Roberto Firmino on Tuesday, though the Brazilian forward is now back running after nursing a foot issue and is set to travel to Spain with his team-mates. Divock Origi will be assessed after missing the win over Newcastle through non-Covid illness, though Curtis Jones and Kostas Tsimikas are available again. Klopp made five changes in total at St James’ Park, with Mohamed Salah, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ibrahima Konate all moving to the bench. That quintet should return to the starting lineup against Villarreal, though it’s a difficult juggling act with Tottenham visiting Anfield on Saturday evening and the FA Cup Final against Chelsea now less than two weeks away. Mo Salah will return to Liverpool’s starting XI against Villarreal after being rested at Newcastle Klopp is not expecting any players to miss out with a stomach bug that has been in camp of late. Villarreal boss Emery made eight changes of his own against Alaves, with only Samuel Chukwueze, Dani Parejo and Pau Torres retaining their starting berths from Anfield. Former Liverpool full-back Alberto Moreno remains sidelined with a long-term knee injury, but a major boost should come with the return of key striker Gerard Moreno, who sat out the first leg with a hamstring complaint. Raul Albiol and ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin have both shaken off knocks, though Arnaut Danjuma is now struggling with a foot problem after missing training on Monday. Predicted Villarreal XI: Rulli, Foyth, Albiol, Torres, Estupinan, Parejo, Capoue, Coquelin, Lo Celso, Chukwueze, Gerard Predicted Liverpool XI: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Konate, Robertson; Fabinho, Henderson, Thiago; Mane, Salah, Diaz Villarreal’s gameplan totally failed at Anfield, with no shots on target, barely any possession and next to no opportunities to hit on the break. Untroubled Liverpool were entirely comfortable and should unquestionably have won by more as they serenely controlled and dominated proceedings. The wily Emery will have to make big tactical changes for the second leg as they need to put Liverpool under far more pressure from the outset. However, their chances of breaching a mean defence that have now kept four successive clean sheets across all competitions appear slim. Villarreal need to push on and take the initiative in front of their own fans, which will inevitably leave plenty of space in behind for the likes of Salah, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz to exploit. Liverpool to win, 2-0. Villarreal’s only win over Liverpool to date came on home soil back in the first leg of the Europa League semi-finals in 2016, with an injury-time effort from Adrian Lopez. However, the Reds hit back with goals from Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana at Anfield, winning 3-0 to book their place in the Basel showpiece, which they lost to Emery’s Sevilla.

Spurs face a daunting trip to quadruple-chasing Liverpool on Saturday evening before Arsenal host Leeds, who have been dragged into the thick of a three-way relegation fight. With a two-point lead over their bitter rivals, fourth-placed Arsenal will be the more comfortable of the two, and this weekend offers them a good chance to open up a five-point gap on Spurs and potentially a cushion going into the north London derby at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Thursday week. But this is merely a scrap for fourth place, quite different to the relentless nature of the title race between Liverpool and Manchester City. Neither Arsenal nor Spurs have shown enough consistency this season to suggest they are certain to win their three other fixtures, so there should be more twists to come. If Spurs have an X-factor, it is their world-class individuals. In head coach Antonio Conte, they have one of the game’s best, while Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester was made comfortable by the brilliance of Harry Kane, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski at one end and Cristian Romero at the other. Arsenal, by contrast, are lacking the same star quality but feel like a more rounded team under Mikel Arteta, further along in their rebuild than their neighbours. Last month, Brighton and Brentford offered a blueprint of how to nullify Conte’s Spurs — specifically, deny them space in the final third and stop Kane getting on the ball — and, in having a more clearly-defined system, Arsenal are harder to stop and better at breaking down stubborn opponents. Arteta is also getting more from his squad than Conte, and important performances from fringe players Mohamed Elneny, Eddie Nketiah and Rob Holding in the wins over Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham point to a united group, with deceptive depth. By contrast, Lucas Moura was hopelessly rusty on his first Spurs start since mid-February on Sunday, while Harry Winks was off the pace in a late cameo, hardly surprisingly given Conte has barely changed his XI for over two months. Both clubs have been impacted by injuries in the same positions, with Spurs losing midfielder Oliver Skipp and wing-back Matt Doherty, and Arsenal without Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney in similar positions. Mikel Arteta vs Antonio Conte - who will win the race for Champions League qualification? The absences may prove crucial in the run-in. In Nuno Tavares, who is deputising for Tierney at left wing-back, Arsenal have an agent of chaos, and while the Portuguese is in the team there is a chance they will drop points in any game. Kulusevski, who came off the bench to twice assist Son on Sunday, should have the beating of Tavares if they both start on May 12. For all their star quality up front, Spurs, though, are weak on both flanks. In the absence of Doherty and Sergio Reguilon, who is sidelined indefinitely with a groin injury, wing-backs Emerson Royal and Ryan Sessegnon failed to make an impact in the final third against Leicester. But it is long past the point where Conte is likely to change his system or experiment on the flanks. If Arsenal allow Spurs’ wing-backs to have the ball, and keep it away from their forwards, they will be in a strong position next week. Spurs finish the season against Burnley, who are likely to be fighting for survival, and already-relegated Norwich, while Arsenal face a tough trip to Newcastle and host Everton on the final day, when the Toffees may also be playing for their Premier League status. The derby will surely be crucial, but the fight for Champions League football could come down to Spurs’ individual brilliance against Arsenal’s collective cohesion and unity. Whatever happens in the next fortnight, expect the contest to go the wire. ",positive,Liverpool,2

He has seen too much, both he and Liverpool involved in too many comebacks - usually as perpetrator - from more perilous positions than the one Villarreal find themselves in, to entertain that kind of talk. Still, Klopp’s team selection for Saturday’s trip to Newcastle suggested that beneath the obligatory lip service, cliched chatter of it being “only half-time”, he genuinely feels the job is not done, with Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara all rotated for what was a must-win game. It feels like an age since the quadruple-pursuers last played a match that wasn’t one of those, and while a draw or a one-goal defeat would of course be enough to reach a third Champions League final in five seasons, there is little danger of Klopp’s side hunkering down and looking to ride out a yellow storm at El Madrigal tonight. “We have to be ready to suffer and sit back in moments, but not as a general approach,” the 54-year-old said, highlighting the aggression that has seen them win five out of five away from home in the competition this season, racking up 15 goals across trips to Benfica, Porto, Atletico Madrid and both Milan giants. Liverpool won’t rest on their laurels in tonight’s Champions League semi-final second leg against Villarreal “We didn't win the games by sitting deep and counter-attacking,” he added. ""We tried to play as ourselves and we have to do that again.” Alexander-Arnold, too, warned against the old demon that is complacency but neither Klopp nor circumstances have allowed it to fester in this group. The German’s intensity does not permit half-heartedness even if his team now play with more control than in the thunderous early years of his reign, while the Reds’ new-found depth and blessed fortune with injuries mean individual shirts are on the line every week. One early goal could, of course, swing the tie, but the trouble for Unai Emery and Villarreal is that should Liverpool score it, even without the away goals rule, it would surely signal game over. The Spaniards must be foot-perfect, riding their luck as they did at times in the second leg of their quarter-final against Bayern Munich, staying in the game and showing the ruthless streak that saw off Juventus in a late flurry in the round before that. “We will try to find some weak spots,” Emery said yesterday, before acknowledging that is “something that no one has done this season."" If there is hope for Villarreal, it may lie in the second-leg sloppiness that has left the aggregate scoreline shy of reflecting Liverpool’s dominance of each of their knockout ties to date, though in neither the 6-4 against Benfica nor 2-1 against Inter did the Reds ever look in real danger of an exit. Emery will be boosted by the return of Spain striker Gerard Moreno, but it may be a case of one-in, one-out, with concern over the fitness of top scorer Arnaut Danjuma after the former Bournemouth man missed training yesterday. Liverpool will still be without Roberto Firmino, though the Brazilian has travelled with the squad to Spain. ",positive,Liverpool,6

Son reached 19 goals for the season with a clinical double in Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester, making him the outright top scorer from open play in the Premier League and behind only Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah -- on 22 -- in the race for the Golden Boot. Both of Son’s goals came with his supposedly weaker left foot, including a stunning effort into the top corner to make it 3-0, and he also assisted Harry Kane’s opener with a corner. Kane is widely regarded as one of the best forwards in the world but Son is often overlooked in debates about the league’s best marksmen, despite his consistency. Asked about the front five of next weekend’s opponents Liverpool, Sessegnon said he would not swap Kane or Son for anyone and believes the latter is underrated on account of his character. Asked if Son is one of the best in the world, Sessegnon said: ""100 per cent. He has been consistent over the last six or seven years, doing it at the top level and the numbers speak for themselves. ""It’s hard to know why he is underrated because consistently, season after season, his numbers are there. I think it’s because he’s such a down-to-earth, normal guy. He’s not an arrogant person and he’s just very friendly with everyone. That’s probably why [he is underrated]. ""Of course, [Son and Kane] make it much easier for us. They can do special things on the ball and you saw that again on Sunday. Sonny assisted H again and their combination they’ve had ever since playing together is unbelievable. ""No way [would we swap them]. The two players we have [up front] are world class and we wouldn’t swap them for anyone."" Sessegnon’s Spurs career has been revived under Antonio Conte and he is hoping the head coach remains at the club next season, despite his consistent refusals to commit beyond the end of the current campaign. The wing-back insists the speculation over Conte’s future is not a distraction for the squad and says the Italian is helping to restore his confidence after a succession of hamstring injuries. ""Is the speculation unsettling? Not really, not at all,"" Sessegnon said. ""We’re professionals and we focus on our game and step by step. You heard him yourself, [the speculation is] obviously false news, he’s focusing on here at the club. As players we’re just focusing on our job going forward and that’s all we can do. ""Of course I hope he stays, he’s a top manager and he’s shown that with us this season. We hope he’s here next season and for us the main objective is to get in that top four and then prepare for next season. ""It has not been easy [for me] since I’ve been at the club, but step by step he gives me confidence in every game to go and do what I can do,"" Sessegnon added. ""For me it’s about believing in myself and getting in that positive run, feeling good and keep pushing. ""Every day, every game as well learning bit by bit, the defensive side, the attacking side. Of course he’s very demanding and [as a wing-back] you need to be up and down. You almost have to manage yourself when to go, when to relax a little bit, but it is relentless."" Asked if he now has confidence in his body to remain injury-free, the 21-year-old added: ""Definitely. At times it is quite hard, it’s a mental battle with the physical side as well.

Last week’s tussle between the respective champions of England and Spain at the Etihad was an instant classic, with early goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus seeing the hosts race into a 2-0 lead inside 11 minutes. City could and should have scored a hatful more before the evergreen Ballon d’Or front-runner Karim Benzema reduced the deficit in trademark fashion, with second-half goals from Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva then sandwiched between a sensational Vinicius Junior effort and followed by an outrageous Benzema Panenka penalty that left a thrilling tie brilliantly poised at 4-3. Despite being ahead, there is a sense of real potential missed opportunity as Pep Guardiola’s Premier League leaders head to the Bernabeu, where Real are typically so dominant, though very nearly came unstuck in humiliating fashion against Chelsea in the quarter-finals. Both sides followed up that unforgettable first leg with thumping 4-0 domestic victories at the weekend - City winning at Leeds to regain top spot from Liverpool and Carlo Ancelotti’s Real celebrating clinching their 35th LaLiga title after a demolition of Espanyol. Either Liverpool or Villarreal await in the final at the Stade de France in Paris on May 28. Real Madrid vs Manchester City is scheduled for an 8pm BST kick-off on Wednesday May 4, 2022. The match will take place at the Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid, Spain. TV channel: The semi-final second leg will be televised live on BT Sport 2 and BT Sport Ultimate, with coverage beginning at 7pm. Live stream: Subscribers will also be able to watch the game online via the BT Sport website or app. Live blog: You can also follow all the action as it unfolds on the night via Standard Sport’s dedicated blog. James Robson will be providing expert analysis from Madrid. City look set to remain without experienced right-back Kyle Walker, who may not play again this season due to an ankle injury suffered in the quarter-final second leg against Atletico Madrid. Defensive colleague John Stones will be assessed after remaining sidelined for the win over Leeds, having limped off last week against Madrid - starting at right-back - in the first half. Guardiola made five changes to his first XI at Elland Road, with Stones, Oleksandr Zinchenko, De Bruyne, Bernardo and Riyad Mahrez replaced by Joao Cancelo, Nathan Ake, Ilkay Gundogan, Jack Grealish and Raheem Sterling. For Madrid, David Alaba is once again facing a race against time to be fit after recovering from a hamstring injury to start in the first leg, only to suffer a setback and go off at half-time. Casemiro is now fully fit, but Eden Hazard remains out as he recovers from an ankle operation and Gareth Bale missed the weekend’s title celebrations with back spasms. Based on the first leg, which was more akin to a basketball match, predicting an exact scoreline between these two attacking powerhouses is a fool’s errand. Last week’s contest was absorbing, chaotic and gloriously eventful, with seven goals scored when in reality it could and should have been well into double figures. City will be kicking themselves that they couldn’t get the job done last week despite their hatfuls of chances, with Real always managing to somehow hang on and prevail in the end. This truly could go either way, but we’re backing Guardiola’s men to narrowly progess in another high-octane affair and book a second consecutive final berth. Man City to win, 3-2. Real Madrid’s last victory over Manchester City came back in May 2016, when they advanced to the final in Milan after a Fernando own goal in another semi-final second leg at the Bernabeu.

Widely expected to leave in 2024, Klopp extended his stay until the summer of 2026 on Thursday and will outlast even the great Bob Paisley should he see that deal out in full. Having restored Liverpool to the top of the English and European game already during his tenure, Klopp could see his side win an unprecedented quadruple this season, a feat that would surely rival anything in the club game. With Pep Guardiola’s future at Manchester City beyond 2023 uncertain and Liverpool’s recent transfer business padding out an already successful squad with developing talents, there is every chance the success under Klopp could continue. Alexander-Arnold, however, has insisted the squad are not focusing too much on the future. “Hopefully those extra two years [of Klopp] are as successful,” he said during his pre-match conference. “It’s an increase in success every year with him. This has been special so far. We can make it something special. Hopefully we’ve got 4 more years of that to come. “It wasn’t like it was a big party when he heard. It’s hard for news to sink in when games come thick and fast. “We’ll know when we sit down that it is good news but as a set of lads, we’re focused. He hasn’t spoken about it.

The Blues slumped to a dismal 1-0 defeat by relegation battlers managed by Frank Lampard at Goodison Park on Sunday after captain Cesar Azpilicueta inexplicably lost the ball to Richarlison, who promptly slotted home what proved to be the winning goal just after half-time. Chelsea were then thwarted by a combination of their own profligacy, the woodwork and an outstanding display from England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford as Everton picked up a vital three points in their fight against relegation from the Premier League and their opponents were left to rue another self-inflicted disappointment. Manager Thomas Tuchel lamented his side’s sudden penchant for critical mistakes, which also cost them against Arsenal last week and in their agonising Champions League quarter-final defeat by Real Madrid. Loftus-Cheek was one of the few Chelsea players to come out of the defeat on Merseyside with any credit, denied a goal by the excellent Pickford and trying to drive his team forward whenever possible on his 50th start for the club. Ruben Loftus-Cheek was one of Chelsea’s few bright lights in their dismal defeat at Everton “We’re all very disappointed,” the 26-year-old told Chelsea’s official website. “Coming into the game we knew it was going to be a hostile atmosphere and it’d be like a final to them. We felt that straight away. “They came out of the blocks second half and caught us napping. We were fighting an uphill battle from then on, the fans were behind them, and it was hard to break them down. It was disappointing. “We’ve made a few mistakes over the past few matches and haven’t kept clean sheets from individual errors. That is how football is, if you keep shooting yourselves in the foot it will be difficult to get out of it.” Chelsea will be desperate to iron out those blunders before they face in-form Liverpool in a domestic cup final for the second time this season at Wembley on May 14. A third defeat in six Premier League games has also loosened their grip further on third place, with resurgent Arsenal now just three points behind and Tottenham five adrift of Chelsea with four matches left to play this term. Asked how Tuchel’s side could go about eradicating those repeated errors, Loftus-Cheek added: “It’s up to us as individuals to tune in and sharpen up as a team together. Getting everyone ready for the game, these are basics in football. “If you don’t have these basics, you will struggle like we have the last four games. This is not Chelsea standard at all. Our concentration levels were not good enough. “We want top four but we cannot perform like that with other teams doing well around us. We need wins. It is hard to process it right now and we will look back at it once the emotions have calmed down. “We had chances to score numerous times. Their keeper made some great saves. If we put them in, I think we could be coming away with a win.” ",positive,Liverpool,1

Tomiyasu made his first Premier League start since January following a lenghty calf problem but was replaced by Cedric Soares after pulling up injured in the 78th minute. Saka, meanwhile, was brought off for Emile Smith Rowe for the final few minutes at the London Stadium and looked to be in some discomfort in the closing stages. Ben White missed the game with a tight hamstring, although it is hoped his problem is not serious. Arteta, who has already lost Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey to injury problems during the run-in, provided a positive update on his players after the game. “Ben got injured against Manchester United, he felt a muscular problem and we checked him, and we will have to assess him in the next few days to see how he is,” he said. “Bukayo was fine, he was really fatigued and he has been through a little injury as well. Tomiyasu has just that he had been out for so long and could not continue.” Arsenal are next in action when they host Leeds United on Sunday, a day after top four rivals Tottenham travel to Liverpool. The two north London heavyweights will then meet on Thursday May 12 in what looks like a straight shootout to determine who qualifies for next season’s Champions League. ",positive,Liverpool,1

Richarlison responded by picking the object up and throwing it, although it was unclear where it landed. A club spokesperson said: ""We will look into the matter but, as far we we are concerned, Richarlison was attempting to throw it out of the ground."" In February, Liverpool midfielder Harvey Elliott was contacted by the FA after handling a red flare following the side’s Carabao Cup victory at Wembley.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/antonio-conte-heung-min-son-tottenham-leicester-b997419.html,Antonio Conte hails ‘fantastic’ Heung-min Son after match-winning display against Leicester,"ntonio Conte praised “fantastic” Heung-min Son after the forward scored twice in Tottenham’s 3-1 win over Leicester - but warned that individual quality will count for little if his side do not finish in the top four. Spurs moved back ahead of Arsenal, albeit possibly temporarily, after Son scored twice in the second half, including a stunning effort into the top corner, against a much-changed Leicester. The South Korean’s first-half corner was headed home by Harry Kane — his 18th goal in 17 appearances against his former loan club — and he twice finished passes from substitute Dejan Kulusevski after the break. Kelechi Iheanacho scored a stoppage-time consolation for the Foxes, who made eight changes ahead of their visit to Roma for Thursday’s Europa Conference League semi-final decider. “I gave him a big hug because after an amazing goal my question was, ‘Which is his favourite foot, right or left?’” Conte said of Son, who scored both goals his his supposedly weaker left foot. “He scored a fantastic goal and three minutes before, when I spoke with him, I said, ‘Go for five or six minutes and then I have to make a change’. “So [after the game] I said to him, ‘You listened that I wanted to make a change and you decide to score this amazing goal!’ “We are talking about a great player, a fantastic player. “But it’s important at the end of the season to celebrate a big achievement with the team. Otherwise it remains only a personal success to score these types of goals.” Spurs moved a point clear of Arsenal, with Conte’s side facing Liverpool at Anfield next weekend and Arsenal playing Leeds, before they meet in a potentially decisive north London derby on May 12. Conte added: “It was a good performance against a really good team. “The game wasn’t easy and we knew very well that despite them making eight changes from the last game against Roma you can see the quality, you can see the squad that Leicester has. “For sure we got three points in an important moment of the season especially because in the next games we are going to face first Liverpool and then Arsenal. “Today it was vital to get three points. There is only one result and a lot of pressure, but I said to my players to live this moment, to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months. “I think no one at the start of the season could imagine Tottenham challenging for a place in the Champions League, especially in November when there was a change [of manager] and for this reason we have to be satisfied that we stay in this position to fight for a big achievement.” Conte also hailed Cristian Romero, who was imperious on the right of Spurs’ back three and helped create their all-important second goal - a close range finish from Son. The Argentine won the ball in a crunching 50-50 with Caglar Soyuncu before Kulusevski slipped in Son. “He played a good game,” the Spurs head coach said. “I think every single player played very well. For us it’s very important to do well with the whole team if we want to get three points. It’s no good to play with one, two or three players playing good. We need the whole team playing well and to find a good balance. When this happens we can win the game.” ",positive,Liverpool,2
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/thomas-tuchel-chelsea-premier-league-top-four-b997416.html,Thomas Tuchel admits Chelsea are ‘never safe’ in top-four race after Everton defeat,"homas Tuchel claims Chelsea are now in a battle to secure top four after just two wins in their last six Premier League games. A 1-0 defeat to Everton continued their shaky end of season form and threatens to drag them back towards to Tottenham and Arsenal in the fight for Champions League places. Tuchel criticised his defence for another costly error that gifted Richarlison the winning goal just after half time. But it was a day when his attack let him down once again – even if it required the brilliance of Jordan Pickford to get Everton over the line. Tuchel said: “I said this many weeks ago that I didn’t feel safe and we are never safe. By the way, if we are in a race for top one, top two or top four, no matter what the race, the last four games to only have four points will never be enough, no matter which race we are in. “We have to take care about ourselves. At the moment we don’t get the points when we play well and deserve more and we lose when we play okay. This is a bad mixture.” Cesar Azpilicueta was caught in possession by Richarlison, who fired the winner at the start of the second half. Tuchel has seen his side dominate possession against Manchester United and Everton in the space of three days, yet his team have only managed one goal and one point from those games. He insists the issue is in defence, not attack. “We knew what was coming and like in the last matches we struggled to have clean sheets,” he said. “In the last four we had one, against West Ham, it is the only win we have and I’m very disappointed. “What can I do? The ball is free, give a goal away, it is the worst thing that can happen to you in this atmosphere. It happens too often. We struggle to play without big mistakes and it is why we struggle to have results.” On his attack he added: “If there is something I can do I will try it, but if I knew about it I would have done it before. “For me the key is to have a clean sheet. Manchester United was a different game. More open, fluid. We finally scored late and conceded straight away. “For me this is more like the game against West Ham and we had a clean sheet and played without any big mistakes and that gives us the chance to score late. “If you install emotion and belief in a stadium like this, you struggle.” Everton fans tried to put Chelsea off by setting off fireworks outside the Liverpool Hilton hotel where they stayed on Saturday night. Tuchel said they did not affect him. “I personally woke up twice at 1am and 3am for one minute and after the noise. I turned around and kept on sleeping.” ",positive,Liverpool,1
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-leicester-premier-league-heung-min-son-b997413.html,Individual brilliance could give Tottenham edge in battle for Champions League football,"eung-min Son and Cristian Romero made the difference as Tottenham got their top-four push back on track and heaped the pressure on to rivals Arsenal with a 3-1 win over Leicester in north London. For the majority of a scrappy game, there was little between Spurs and a much-changed Foxes, who are prioritising Thursday’s Europa Conference League decider against Roma, but the hosts’ individual quality told after the break, with Son scoring twice and Romero imperious at centre-half. The South Korean’s second goal was stunning curling effort from the edge of the box to make it 3-0, leaving Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg with his head in his hands, while Harry Kane showed flashes of brilliance and opened the scoring in the first half with his 19th goal in 18 appearances against Leicester. Kelechi Iheanacho scored a stoppage-time consolation for the visitors, who struck the post through Patson Daka at 0-0 but were undone by Son after Brendan Rodgers made eight chances ahead of the trip to Rome. This was not the most polished or convincing display from Antonio Conte’s side but, at this stage of this season, points are the only thing that matter and the win move Spurs one ahead of Arsenal, who face West Ham in the later kick-off. Kane predictability opened the scoring, making it 17 goals in 14 League games against his former loan club, while Son continued to prove that he does not need to be especially involved in games to be the most important player on the pitch. Romero, meanwhile, was outstanding, a class above in everything he did. The Argentine’s ferocious tackling set the tone for Spurs to kick-on in the second half and actually proved an attacking weapon in itself when he won the ball in the crunching challenge on Caglar Soyuncu in the build-up to Son’s all-important second goal. Dejan Kulusevski was also decisive, responding to being rested by coming off the bench and making both of Son’s goals, the first with a clever pass. But Son was really the star, moving ahead of Mohamed Salah for non-penalty goals this season, suggesting he still remains something of an underrated force. Rather than dominating matches, he is increasingly a clutch player in the final third, assisting or scoring when they need a jolt. He set Spurs on their way with a corner for Kane to stoop and score at the near post. If his first goal was a poacher’s finish inside the box, the second goal was inspired, as Son curled into the top corner with his left foot from 20 yards, leaving Kaspar Schmeichel with no chance. This win was an important reminder that while Spurs remain a work in progress under Conte, they have the individuals at both ends of the pitch to win any of their final four matches, even next weekend’s visit to Liverpool, when Kane and Son should relish the space behind the hosts’ high line. A frustration for Conte is that none of his stars had stepped up in the meek displays against Brighton and Brentford, although a Leicester side who are hard-wired to play on the front-foot were also likely to be a more attractive opponent for Conte’s side. While Arsenal are arguably a more well-rounded side than Spurs, further ahead in their development under Mikel Arteta, if this game is anything to go by, Spurs’ individual brilliance and world-class front two could be an important factor in the race for the Champions League.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-fc-pickford-everton-b997412.html,Magnificent Jordan Pickford display no excuse for Chelsea in latest lacklustre performance,"f not for Jordan Pickford, Chelsea would have won this match. But while the England goalkeeper was in Superman mode, it would be letting Thomas Tuchel’s side off the hook to suggest he was the overriding reason for Everton’s crucial 1-0 win. As inspired as he was, Chelsea were abject. They slept-walked through the first half at Goodison Park, stumbled into the traps Frank Lampard set – and, ultimately, got what they deserved. Absolutely nothing. Cesar Azpilicueta’s error at the start of the second half was seized on by Richarlison and may go a long way towards the Toffees’ Premier League survival. The roar from the home crowd that greeted every challenge won, every heroic moment from Pickford, and the final whistle - underlining just how significant a result this was. As for Chelsea, they felt ill-prepared for the fight they were in for, but – most worryingly for Tuchel – ill-prepared to capitalise on the dominance of the ball Lampard was clearly happy to concede. Chelsea’s manager simply must address this glaring weakness in his team if he is to have any hope of closing the gap to Manchester City and Liverpool next season. In back-to-back games in the North West this week – against Manchester United and Everton – they have bossed possession and chances created and walked away with one goal and one point from a possible six. That is not good enough for any team with realistic ambitions of the title. Which is why his claim that his defence is his biggest concern after these latest dropped points, may not sit too well with supporters. “If there is something I can do, I will try it, but if I knew about it I would have done it before,” Tuchel said. “For me the key is to have a clean sheet. The issue is that we don’t have enough clean sheets.” The ongoing lack of cohesion in his forward line, as well as lack of precision, has cost Chelsea too often this season and their manager cannot turn a blind eye to it. At this point it feels as much to do with personnel as the coaching. This is a problem that has been in place since Tuchel took charge 15 months ago, with the list of strikers who have failed to produce at the point of his attack stretching from Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud to Timo Werner and Romelu Lukaku. With Chelsea desperate for a goal with more than 20 minutes to go, Tuchel left £97.5million record signing Lukaku on the bench. That speaks volumes about the Belgian’s future – but also points to his manager’s failure to get a tune out of him. If a new centre forward is recruited this summer, would there be any confidence that he would thrive where a growing list of others have not? But it is not only the cutting edge. Where is Chelsea’s guile around the box to open up deep-lying defences? They too often rely on the width of Reece James or the injured Ben Chilwell - missing the sort of incisive, intricate football City and Liverpool produce. Mason Mount, deployed as a No10 again, is energetic, but at times his side need craft over graft. These are all areas Tuchel must look at if his side are to find another dimension. It was not until the second half, with Chelsea a goal behind and fortunate not to be two-down that they finally awoke from their slumber. Unfortunately for them, Pickford’s concentration levels were sharp despite his inaction. First the he tipped Mount’s effort from inside the box onto the post, with the ball rolling across to hit the other upright. From the rebound, Azpilicueta fired goalwards, but Pickford was there again to block. Moments later he was flying at the feet of Toni Rudiger to deny the Chelsea from close range – albeit with his face. He would not be beaten. Ruben Loftus-Cheek – one of Chelsea’s few players to try to open Everton up – struck from distance, only for Pickford to get a hand on it again. Even deep into stoppage time, substitute Mateo Kovacic was denied an equaliser when the keeper dived low to claw away from the bottom corner. Pickford celebrated every save like it was a goal – and so did the crowd. Chelsea’s fans, meanwhile, were given nothing to cheer. ",positive,Liverpool,2

Ratcliffe, one of Britain’s richest men, has been linked with a takeover of Chelsea in the past but only last month a spokesperson dismissed reports he could succeed Roman Abramovich. The race to buy the club following the sanctioning of Russian billionaire Abramovich had been whittled down to three contenders, with consortiums headed by former Liverpool chairman Sir Michael Broughton, LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly and Steve Pagliuca, who co-owns the Boston Celtics, left in the running after a fourth prospective owner - the Ricketts family - pulled out. The process had been nearing its conclusion, with a preferred buyer due to be announced but 69-year-old Ratcliffe revealed to The Times that he had submitted a late offer to US merchant bank Raine Group - who are overseeing the sale - on Friday morning worth more than £4billion, having held talks with Blues chairman Bruce Buck yesterday. An Ineos statement confirmed: “Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Chairman of INEOS, has made a formal bid for Chelsea FC, for £4.25bn. £2.5bn is committed to the Charitable Trust to support victims of the war, with £1.75bn committed to investment directly into the club over the next 10 years. “This is a British bid, for a British club. We believe that a club is bigger than its owners who are temporary custodians of a great tradition. With responsibility to the fans and the community. That is why we are committing to spending £1.75bn over 10 years that will be for the direct benefit of the club. We will invest in Stamford Bridge to make it a world-class stadium, befitting of Chelsea FC. This will be organic and on-going so that we will not move away from the home of Chelsea and risk losing the support of loyal fans.” Ratcliffe already has significant experience in sport, currently the owner of Ligue 1 side OGC Nice and Tour de France-winning cycling team Ineos Grenadiers. Ineos are also principal sponsors of Formula One world champions Mercedes and sailing’s Ineos Team UK. Their statement continued: “We will continue to invest in the team to ensure we have a first class squad of the world’s greatest players, coaches and support staff, in the men’s and women’s games. “And we hope to continue to invest in the academy to provide opportunity for talented youngsters to develop into first class players. We believe that London should have a club that reflects the stature of the city. One that is held in the same regard as Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich. We intend Chelsea to be that club. “We are making this investment as fans of the beautiful game – not as a means to turn a profit. We do that with our core businesses. The club is rooted in its community and its fans. And it is our intention to invest in Chelsea FC for that reason.” ",positive,Liverpool,1

The Reds didn’t ever look in any trouble in the first leg, the only danger to them that frustration grew as the Spanish side kept them at bay in the first-half. But Jordan Henderson’s cross found the back of the net with the help of a deflection off Pervis Estunpinan and less than two minutes later, Sadio Mane had doubled the lead with a smart finish. Villarreal will have home advantage in next week’s return fixture, but that looks unlikely to stop Liverpool sealing a third Champions League final appearance under Jurgen Klopp. Unai Emery’s side made their intentions very clear inside two minutes, when goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli took 30 seconds over a goal-kick much to the outrage of the Kop behind him. Liverpool’s first chance of the match fell to Sadio Mane when he got on the end of a cross from Mohamed Salah, but he was unable to direct his header with the ball slightly behind him. Jordan Henderson’s cross nearly found a way in at the near post, before Luis Diaz had a couple of shots from range saved. Giovani Lo Celso, on loan from Tottenham, made a brilliant block to deny Salah and the Egyptian then shinned an effort over the bar from close range as Liverpool piled on the pressure. They came closest to the opening goal a few minutes before the break when Thiago tried his luck from 30 yards, only to see his brilliant strike smack off the outside of the post. Liverpool had the ball in the back of the net shortly into the second-half as Fabinho finished from close range, but the linesman’s flag quickly went up with Virgil van Dijk offside in the build-up. A brilliant two-minute spell was all it took for the Reds to take complete control of the tie. The ball was worked out wide to Henderson as Liverpool found some rare space, his cross flicked off Estupinan and floated beyond the goalkeeper into the far corner. Emery didn’t have time to consider a change of approach before the lead was swiftly doubled. There was nothing fortunate about this one, with Salah playing a great pass through to Mane and he poked the finish past Rulli at the near post. It was very nearly three midway through the second-half, as Andy Robertson volleyed home from a brilliant Trent Alexander-Arnold cross, but once again the offside flag was swiftly up as he went to wheel away in celebration. Villarreal didn’t threaten to find a way back into the match, managing just a single shot across the 90 minutes, and they’ll need to produce an almost miraculous comeback on home soil next Tuesday if they are to turn the tie around and reach the Champions League final.

The La Liga fell to a 2-0 defeat at Anfield, and are perhaps fortunate to only be taking a two-goal deficit into the second leg after they were utterly dominated by Jurgen Klopp’s side. Jordan Henderson’s cross took a flick off Pervis Estupinan and found the far corner for the opening goal, before Sadio Mane doubled the lead less than two minutes later to give Liverpool a lead they more than deserved. Emery and Villarreal have done superbly to reach the last four for just the second time in the club’s history, but they know they will need to significantly improve if they are to score the two goals they will at a minimum require next week. “We can’t dispute the result because they deserve it,” Emery said. “The first half was defensively good but we didn’t achieve in attack. They had two or three chances to score. “The second half was the same and they pushed and deserved to score. 2-0 is a good difference for them, for us not a good result but we will try to dream and do something different in our home. “The match next week will be very different than tonight. It is very important in our home to change something, maybe tactically. They are going to suffer more than tonight.” ",positive,Liverpool,2

With Manchester City not in action until later on Saturday when they face Leeds, Jurgen Klopp’s side took full advantage to end the Magpies’ run of fix straight home victories. Jurgen Klopp was able to rest Trent Alexander-Arnold, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara and Mohamed Salah from his startling line-up ahead of Tuesday’s decisive Champions League semi-final trip to Villarreal. Liverpool could - and probably should - have won more comfortably in front of a boisterous crowd of 52,281 as they held the upper hand for much of a contest which saw the Magpies’ hopes of a fifth successive league win and a seventh on the trot at home wilt in the face of almost constant pressure. Eddie Howe’s men were never able to build up the kind of head of steam which has eased them clear of the relegation battle, perhaps a reminder of how far they have to go before they can once again compete with English football’s best on a sustained basis. SPONSORED The game kicked off amid a raucous atmosphere which might have increased had Jonjo Shelvey managed to make a better connection with a second-minute shot. Diogo Jota was similarly unable to make the most of a half-chance as the ball dropped to him inside the Newcastle penalty area, but Keita had keeper Martin Dubravka scrambling across his line as his first-time strike flew inches wide of the far post with eight minutes gone. Jordan Henderson volleyed high over from Andy Robertson’s corner with the Reds menacing in possession, which they increasingly started to dominate as Henderson and James Milner were allowed to dictate from the middle of the field. They took the lead with 19 minutes gone when, with the home side appealing in vain for a free-kick following Milner’s challenge on Fabian Schar, Henderson and Jota combined to feed Keita, who stepped inside before dispatching the ball past the helpless Dubravka. Newcastle’s response was tepid with Allan Saint-Maximin dragging a 28th-minute effort harmlessly wide as the visitors denied Bruno Guimaraes time and space to effectively limit his creativity, and Dubravka had to get down well to keep out Sadio Mane’s shot after Luis Diaz had raced away down the right 11 minutes before the break. Miguel Almiron thought he had levelled with six minutes of the half remaining after rounding Alisson, only for an offside flag to dash his hopes, and it took a fine fingertip save by Dubravka to prevent Jota from increasing the visitors’ lead as the whistle approached. Newcastle returned with greater intensity, but with key men Guimaraes and Saint-Maximin still largely curtailed, were unable to cause enough problems to trouble Alisson and his defence unduly, and Dubravka had to be alert to deny Jota and Robertson in quick succession as the hour mark approached. Mane might have killed the game off with 27 minutes remaining but steered his shot wide, and Dubravka had to save from substitute Salah and Jota as Liverpool eased to victory, although Alisson had to be vigilant to keep out Guimaraes’ late strike.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/liverpool-champions-league-chaos-calm-control-quadruple-b996849.html,Liverpool swap Champions League chaos for calm and control to serenely keep quadruple bid on track,"urgen Klopp will always be synonymous with rock ‘n’ roll football, but as his Liverpool team took another giant leap towards what would be the greatest achievement of his - or almost any - managerial career, it was control and calm in which he found most satisfaction. In beating Villarreal 2-0 at Anfield last night, the Reds went a long way to ensuring their quadruple bid will, at the very least, go to the wire and did so without coming out of third gear, the home crowd departing having suffered nothing like the emotional exhaustion that knockout European ties at this ground are renowned for delivering. Their side had enjoyed three-quarters of the possession, barely once been exposed on the break and allowed just one shot, off target. Alisson in the home goal did not make a save until falling on a tame strike three minutes from time as the linesman raised his offside flag anyway. “We wanted to score a third, but from a specific moment on it makes sense that you control the game, and that is what we did,” Klopp said. Not only against the basketball match at the Etihad 24 hours earlier was the contrast stark, but also compared with the Reds’ two previous semi-finals under the German, the frantic 7-6 aggregate win over Roma in 2018 and the famous 4-3 comeback against Barcelona 12 months later. Klopp was asked whether lessons could be learned from the former of those ties, the Reds having been 5-2 up after the first leg at home before almost blowing it as the Italians rallied in Rome, but looked genuinely perplexed as to the relevance. This is a different team, in terms of both personnel and style, typified by the conducting presence of Thiago Alcantara and Fabinho in midfield, who play each game as if they’ve seen it before, like two men watching their favourite sitcom for the thousandth time, aware of what’s about to happen long before it does. In any other season, given this club’s relationship with the European Cup, a Champions League run that now looks almost certain to end in next month’s final would be front and centre. But such serene progress through the rounds has made this one feel as if it has been going on almost in the background, cruising along untroubled while all eyes have been on a domestic tussle with Manchester City. The Premier League still looks the most problematic element of this four-trophy pursuit, but when big games come every three or four days it certainly helps to deal in smooth rides rather than rollercoasters, and the swiftness with which Liverpool have seized command of each of their knockout ties to date has surely played some part in sustaining a quadruple push for so long. Liverpool have one foot in the Champions League Final after a 2-0 win over Villarreal at Anfield Klopp’s side have benefited from a kind draw, yes (though it did not look like that when the one for the group stage was made), but there have been virtually no moments of jeopardy, except perhaps in the 120 seconds between Lautaro Martinez’s goal and Alexis Sanchez’s red card in the last-16 second leg against Inter Milan. There has been no need for moments of Divock Origi-esque, legend-making heroism, either. In fact, the last time Liverpool’s future participation in this competition looked in serious doubt was as Trent Alexander-Arnold was preparing to land a corner on Alisson's head at The Hawthorns last May, before they had qualified for it in the first place. The caveat in all of this is that Villarreal were poor, a team who have clearly earned their spot at this stage of the competition but did not produce a performance worthy of it. Two nights of semi-finals have confirmed suspicions that the Premier League’s two best sides are also the best in Europe Unai Emery has won praise for assembling a team far greater than the sum of its parts but last night the gulf between the sides was of the size you’d expect if glancing at the teamsheets without the knowledge that the Spaniards had already taken care of Bayern Munich and Juventus. Two nights of semi-finals have confirmed suspicions that the Premier League’s two best sides are also the best in Europe. Had it not been for the presence of the world’s best player in opposition at the Etihad on Tuesday, and the nagging air of inevitability that lingers around the Champions League Death Star that is the Bernabeu, we might already be making preparations for an all-English final in Paris. With little fuss, Liverpool are almost there. ",positive,Liverpool,5

Pep Guardiola’s side had to respond after Liverpool beat Newcastle and they did just that, with Rodri heading them in front early on. Leeds made it uncomfortable though and threatened to make City stumble in the race. But Nathan Ake doubled the lead after the break and Gabriel Jesus put the result beyond doubt, before Fernandinho capped the win with the final kick of the match to maintain City’s one-point advantage with four league matches remaining. Their focus now turns to the Champions League, as they travel to the Bernabeu to face Real Madrid on Wednesday. As Liverpool did earlier in the day, Guardiola shuffled his pack with Bernardo Silva and Kevin De Bruyne among those named on the bench. Leeds had a big chance to take a shock early lead, when a City corner was cleared out to the halfway line. Joao Cancelo was the last man and he slipped, allowing Rodrigo to charge clear for the home side. He should really have squared it to Raphinha, but took too long to make his decision and the space disappeared. With 13 minutes on the clock, City scored the opening goal themselves. It was incredibly simple too - Phil Foden swung in a brilliant free-kick delivery and Rodri had space in the box to head into the far corner. A nasty clash of heads between Robin Koch and Aymeric Laporte stopped the match and when it resumed, Leeds had their best spell. They rushed City and created some promising moments, but could not turn those into clear-cut chances. Gabriel Jesus fired straight at the goalkeeper after working space in the box, before Stuart Dallas was forced off with what looked to be a serious injury. The Leeds man clattered into Jack Grealish and in doing so was stretchered off himself. City took complete control of the match after the break and it came through another set-piece. The corner was swung in deep, Ruben Dias won the initial header and it fell to Ake who swept home the finish from close-range. Jesse Marsch moved Jack Harrison and Raphinha to wing-back as he threw everything he could at City in the final 25 minutes at Elland Road, but that left them exposed at times. Raheem Sterling had plenty of joy down the right, while Ilkay Gundogan sent a shot from distance wide before he had another from inside the box blocked. Raphinha went close to halving the deficit and setting up a grandstand finish, with Laporte sliding in brilliantly to deflect the Brazilian’s shot over the bar. Any hopes of a Leeds comeback were ended for good by Jesus with just over ten minutes remaining, finishing emphatically after Foden played him in with a wonderful pass. Cancelo could, and probably should, have added a fourth late on when clean through, before Fernandinho did just that deep into stoppage-time when he rifled it low into the far corner from the edge of the box.

Firmino has missed the last four games - including last week’s initial clash - with a foot strain. The Brazilian has travelled after resuming running but won’t play at the Estadio de la Ceramica, where Liverpool head holding a commanding two-goal lead courtesy of a dominant first-leg win at Anfield last week. “Bobby is now running, so it’s good,” Klopp said at his pre-match press conference on Monday. “A little strain here in the middle foot bone, so it’s very painful each step. “But he was running today again, will travel with us but will not be involved in the squad yet. But we hope sooner rather than later.” Divock Origi could return to the Liverpool squad in eastern Spain after sitting out Saturday’s 1-0 Premier League victory against Newcastle due to non-Covid illness.

The quadruple-chasing Reds travel to eastern Spain holding a commanding 2-0 lead in their last-four tie after a Pervis Estupinan own goal and Sadio Mane’s second-half effort in a one-sided first leg at Anfield last week. However, manager Jurgen Klopp is not taking anything for granted on the road to Paris, insisting it is a difficult scoreline as Unai Emery pledged to make his side “suffer” in Tuesday’s return clash. Liverpool followed up that dominant win over Villarreal in which they held 73 per cent of the overall possession and allowed only one shot (which was off-target) by triumphing at Newcastle on Saturday, with Naby Keita’s fourth goal of the season in the early Premier League kick-off ensuring they piled the pressure on title rivals Manchester City, who responded with a routine 3-0 victory at Leeds later in the day to regain top spot with four games to go. Much-changed Villarreal, meanwhile, slumped to a disappointing 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Alaves at the weekend, leaving them seventh in LaLiga, four points adrift of the top six and nine behind Atletico Madrid in fourth.

Klopp made five changes in total at St James’ Park, with Mohamed Salah, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ibrahima Konate all moving to the bench.

Villarreal boss Emery made eight changes of his own against Alaves, with only Samuel Chukwueze, Dani Parejo and Pau Torres retaining their starting berths from Anfield. Former Liverpool full-back Alberto Moreno remains sidelined with a long-term knee injury, but a major boost should come with the return of key striker Gerard Moreno, who sat out the first leg with a hamstring complaint. Raul Albiol and ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin have both shaken off knocks, though Arnaut Danjuma is now struggling with a foot problem after missing training on Monday. Predicted Villarreal XI: Rulli, Foyth, Albiol, Torres, Estupinan, Parejo, Capoue, Coquelin, Lo Celso, Chukwueze, Gerard Predicted Liverpool XI: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Konate, Robertson; Fabinho, Henderson, Thiago; Mane, Salah, Diaz Villarreal’s gameplan totally failed at Anfield, with no shots on target, barely any possession and next to no opportunities to hit on the break. Untroubled Liverpool were entirely comfortable and should unquestionably have won by more as they serenely controlled and dominated proceedings. The wily Emery will have to make big tactical changes for the second leg as they need to put Liverpool under far more pressure from the outset. However, their chances of breaching a mean defence that have now kept four successive clean sheets across all competitions appear slim. Villarreal need to push on and take the initiative in front of their own fans, which will inevitably leave plenty of space in behind for the likes of Salah, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz to exploit. Liverpool to win, 2-0. Villarreal’s only win over Liverpool to date came on home soil back in the first leg of the Europa League semi-finals in 2016, with an injury-time effort from Adrian Lopez.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-antonio-conte-top-four-b997102.html,Antonio Conte must use squad to freshen up stale Tottenham after pair of blanks,"ntonio Conte’s view of his Tottenham squad can be summed up by a phrase the head coach has used to explain his reluctance to make substitutions. “I look to the bench, then I look back to the pitch!” Conte has remarked to staff. Conte, in short, is not convinced by his options outside his first XI, and the only changes he has made in 12 matches have been forced by injuries at wing-back. Saturday’s frustrating 0-0 draw with Brentford perfectly demonstrated Conte’s unwillingness to turn to his bench. With Spurs needing a goal to match Arsenal’s earlier win over Manchester United, Conte’s first change was centre-half Davinson Sanchez for Ryan Sessegnon in the 74th minute, while he did not introduce Lucas Moura until four minutes from time. Steven Bergwijn remained unused, which was bizarre in the circumstances, particularly given the Dutchman’s heroics in the last meeting with Sunday’s opponents Leicester, who visit north London on the back of last night’s 1-1 home draw against Roma in the Europa Conference League. Substitute Bergwijn scored twice in stoppage-time as Spurs sensationally won 3-2, despite trailing in the 95th minute, at the King Power Stadium in January. There is a view from some at Spurs that Bergwijn being the match-winner that night may not have been entirely in the club’s best interests. His stunning late show effectively ensured it would be a PR disaster to sell him to Ajax in the final week of January, as Spurs were considering, but he has since played just 175 minutes in the League. Clearly, the club might have been better off selling him and doing a late deal for a wing-back or an attacker Conte really rates. The big issue with Conte’s reluctance to use his full squad is that his first XI quickly ran out of ideas and steam in the matches against Brighton and Brentford and, damningly, Spurs go into Sunday having not had a shot on target for over three hours. Graham Potter’s Seagulls may just have established a blueprint with which to stop Conte’s side — specifically, prevent Harry Kane from getting on the ball and deny the England captain, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski space in the final third. For all their encouraging progress under Conte, Spurs are still not much better at creating chances against canny opponents as they were under Jose Mourinho. Their wins over Leeds, Everton and West Ham came against sides who all adopted a gung-ho approach, while the thrashings of Aston Villa and Newcastle came after they had been outplayed in the first half but managed to establish a lead, before picking off an opponent who had to chase the game. Until he can make those signings, establishing a Plan B would be a start, but Conte is committed to his approach and appears reluctant to experiment. Among his options would be a switch to a back-four, with Bergwijn or Moura coming in at the expense of a defender, but this risks Spurs’ defensive solidity, which has remained intact. A more realistic move would be to bring either of the above into the front three and move Kulusevski to right wing-back, where the injured Matt Doherty is a miss, as Conte did for the final few minutes against Brentford. The risk there is that the connection between the midfield two and front three is further disrupted without link-man Kulusevski drifting between the thirds. Adding an extra midfield body in Harry Winks is another possibility. The good news for Conte is that Spurs’ next three opponents — Leicester, Liverpool and Arsenal — all have coaches who prefer their teams to have possession and play on the front foot, which should suit the Italian’s approach of absorbing pressure and attacking the space. Conte, though, cannot continue to rely on opponents playing into his team’s hands if Spurs are to overhaul Arsenal again in the battle for fourth. ",positive,Liverpool,1

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-lo-celso-villarreal-conte-b996508.html,Giovani Lo Celso transformed at Villarreal as Antonio Conte proved right after Tottenham struggle,"f all the supposed Premier League rejects, misfits and cast-offs who make up Unai Emery's Villarreal squad against Liverpool tonight, none feel as important to their hopes of another Champions League upset as Tottenham loanee Giovani Lo Celso. Lo Celso has added guile and grit to Emery's midfield and was outstanding as Villarreal eliminated first Juventus then Bayern Munich in the knockouts. Lo Celso was man of the match in the 1-0 win over Bayern in the quarter-final first leg, and pivotal again in the subsequent 1-1 draw in Germany, playing both games with a fizzing intensity which the Bundesliga giants found difficult to contain. He got the pre-assist for both the Yellow Submarine's goals across the tie. The performances could scarcely have been more contrasting to Lo Celso's limp efforts in his final months at Spurs, when the simplest of tasks looked beyond him and supporters grew increasingly exasperated with his inability to impact matches. The Argentine's turnaround since returning to Spain on January deadline day has not come entirely out of the blue, however, but rather feels like the result of a talented player being back in an environment which suits him. Giovani Lo Celso has revitalised his career since leaving Tottenham for Villarreal on a loan deal in January This is certainly the view of Spurs boss Antonio Conte, who regards the midfielder as gifted but ill-suited to the intensity and physicality of English football and judged that he needed to be playing regularly back on the continent. Conte has a point. Lo Celso enjoys dribbling and likes to release the ball late, when he has drawn in an opponent and space has opened up ahead, making him susceptible to challenges. His pass in the build-up to Samuel Chukwueze's decisive goal at Bayern was a good example. In LaLiga and the Champions League, Lo Celso is afforded more time and is said to feel more protected, and therefore more comfortable, than in English football. Before joining Spurs he had practically never been injured but two-and-a-half years of hard knocks in England led to a succession of niggles and more serious complaints, which sapped his confidence and disrupted his rhythm. His commitment to playing for his country, even while Argentina was on the UK's ""red list"" of travel destinations, further contributed to his stop-start season at Spurs and frustrated the club, particularly given the view that Lo Celso was the ringleader in September, when he, Cristian Romero and Davinson Sanchez reported for international duty against the club's wishes and subsequently spent 10 days training in Croatia to avoid a spell in quarantine. That said, Conte's predecessors Jose Mourinho and Mauricio Pochettino admired Lo Celso, and he looked more than capable of playing in England during Project Restart, when he was the heartbeat of Mourinho's improving Tottenham side. While many at Spurs found Lo Celso stand-offish, Mourinho liked his quiet determination and said in July 2020 he would not swap him for ""any player"". Last season, injuries and a loss of form largely reduced Lo Celso to the role of alternate for Tanguy Ndombele, who could rarely maintain his intensity for longer than an hour, and Mourinho's seeming lack of trust in him continued under Conte. Lo Celso spent last season at Spurs as an alternate for the disappointing Tanguy Ndombele By contrast, Emery, who managed Lo Celso at Paris Saint-Germain, has placed enormous faith in the 26-year-old, and regards him as a tactically intelligent player who can carry out specific jobs. Lo Celso has quickly become the leader of Villarreal's defensive press, and he is expected to play off the right in tonight's semi-final first leg to deal with the threat of left-back Andy Robertson, just as he did so successfully against Bayern. While Lo Celso's lack of a defined position was a problem at Spurs, Emery enjoys his versatility and will move him around during matches to suit the situation. There is also a view that Lo Celso may prefer being a bigger fish in a smaller pond, having struggled at PSG and Spurs but shone for Real Betis and Villarreal, who are seventh in LaLiga and will need to win the Champions League to return to the competition next season. Villarreal are desperate to keep Lo Celso but his loan deal does not include an obligation to buy at the end of the season, and Spurs want to recoup as much of the £55million fee they paid Betis as possible. Villarreal have never spent more than £21m on a player and are likely to push for another loan deal. Given Lo Celso’s impact for Villarreal, Spurs could find he has no shortage of suitors in the summer One intriguing hypothetical would be the return of Pochettino from PSG to north London in a job swap with Conte, which has been mooted this week. Lo Celso was signed on Pochettino's watch and he may be more open to keeping his compatriot than Conte. Given Lo Celso's impact for Villarreal, Spurs could find he has no shortage of suitors in the summer, however, particularly if he impresses again at Anfield tonight. ",positive,Liverpool,1

Having stifled Bayern Munich in the previous round, limiting Robert Lewandowski & Co. to just one goal across 180 minutes, Emery and his Villarreal side arrived at Anfield intent on making this semi-final first-leg a non-event and turning the tie into a one-off shootout at El Madrigal in a week’s time. Instead, they were undone by a quickfire double at the start of the second-half that has Klopp’s quadruple chasers on the brink of the Champions League final, knowing only a collapse in that return six days from now will deny them a third trip to the European showpiece in five seasons. By the time they travel to the continent, Liverpool’s pursuit of four trophies will have already gone deeper into a season, in date terms, than any English team in history and, thanks to Jordan Henderson’s deflected cross and Sadio Mane’s finish three minutes later, they are well on their way to becoming the first to play in all three major cup finals in the same season, too. This was not a vintage Reds display and certainly not a match to rival that served up by Manchester City and Real Madrid 24 hours earlier, either. But where City threatened to blow their opponents away, Liverpool prioritised control, never troubled defensively and always likely to win this game by however many they managed to score. The result is that, unlike Pep Guardiola’s men, they will take a two-goal cushion to Spain. Villarreal, for their part, offered up the kind of defensive resistance that Real seemed to have no interest in. Unfortunately, they did not have Karim Benzema at the other end, nor even their own next-best-thing, with Spain striker Gerard Moreno not fit enough even for the bench after a hamstring problem. Their stall was set out from the start. Francis Coquelin played in a four-man midfield containing two holders and was not one of them. Juan Foyth did as good a job as anyone has since his January arrival on these shores of shackling Luis Diaz, aided by the diligence of Giovani Lo Celso. Dani Parejo and Etienne Capoue stationed themselves almost on the toes of their centre-halves, cramping the edge of the box and allowing the likes of Thiago Alcantara all sorts of freedom at anything more than arm’s length, which almost backfired spectacularly when the Spaniard came within inches of a first-half wondergoal, striking some combination of bar and post. All the old tricks were in play, too. Geronimo Rulli took an age over his first goal-kick after just two minutes and continued to do so with admirable consistency. Each time he feigned to play short before ushering his defenders forward, as if only remembering in the nick of time that, against the best pressing team on the planet, that might be unwise. When just a minute was added at the end of the first-half, there were groans from The Kop aplenty. The romanticism of this town of 50,000 weighing in behind a merry band of Premier League cast-offs has afforded them licence to play in this way and Emery, for all his conservatism here, does not inspire the kind of snide fury that courses through, say Diego Simeone’s Atletico Madrid. Still, it was not pretty. Even so, Liverpool’s quality was already threatening to tell. Mane timed his run perfectly but flicked wide from Mo Salah’s superb cross, the pair combining in near-identical fashion to Riyad Mahrez and Kevin de Bruyne for City’s opener 24 hours earlier. A raking fifty-yard pass from Andy Robertson was met with a brilliant first-time cross on the volley from Trent Alexander-Arnold, who picked out Salah, the Egyptian just failing to do likewise with the top corner. It was not individual quality, in the end, that did the trick, but an appreciable lifting of the tempo immediately after half-time and a bit of good fortune, as Henderson’s cross took a nick off Pervis Estupiñán, the change of direction enough to do for Geronimo, who could only flap into his own net. In Emery’s blueprinting of every possible scenario, the folder marked ‘going a goal behind’ must surely have been fairly near the top of the pile. He will have no doubt stressed the importance of dodging the old one-two. But when Liverpool tails are up and Anfield is in full voice, that is easier said than done and Salah soon slid Mane home to poke in a second. There has at times felt like a sense of destiny about Villarreal’s European run. Against a club who know all about that, however, they have surely reached the end of the road. ",positive,Liverpool,4

Overwhelming favourites against the Spanish side even before a ball was kicked in the tie, the Reds have one foot in the final in Paris after a 2-0 victory at Anfield on Wednesday night. Jordan Henderson’s cross deflected in off Pervis Estupiñán soon after half-time before Sadio Mane gave the Reds breathing space ahead of next week’s return. Villarreal have seen off Juventus and Bayern Munich to reach only the second semi-final in their history, but face a huge task to overturn the deficit against Klopp’s quadruple chasers. “It was a brilliant game,” Klopp said. “The first half I liked a lot - we didn’t score, that was the only problem that we had. But we kept them quiet, which was important because of the counter-attacking threat. “We tried to create, tried to be direct, mix it up, play through the lines. We had a lots of good moments, no goals, true, but I was really fine with the first half. “And then in the second half, obviously we finished the situations off. Both goals were outstanding. We wanted to score a third, but from a specific moment on it makes then sense that you control the game, and that is what we did. “It’s half-time, nothing else, but it’s better than before the game.” ",positive,Liverpool,1

Klopp made five changes to his side for the Saturday lunchtime kick-off following a tight turnaround from Wednesday night’s Champions League victory over Villarreal. The German left the likes of Mo Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara on the bench but Naby Keita’s goal ensured the Reds kept up the pressure on Manchester City, climbing to the top of the table, at least until the defending champions play Leeds later on Saturday. A lack of depth was once considered one of Liverpool’s biggest disadvantages compared to City but that is no longer the case, with Klopp’s deputies performing admirably. “It’s the most difficult of circumstances,” Klopp told BT Sport. “A team in form, a crowd waiting for ages for proper success, now they’re having some. Coming here with five changes and building pretty much a new setup is really difficult, so the performance was absolutely outstanding. I loved it. We controlled the game in so many ways. SPONSORED “The only plan they had was the long ball to our right side. The impact we have from the bench is outstanding. Joe Gomez, what a game. Naby Keita, what a game. James Milner, what a game.

The champions romped to a big win over relegation-threatened Watford on Saturday to briefly move four points clear of Liverpool as Gabriel Jesus scored four times in a 5-1 win. With title rivals Liverpool not in action until Sunday against Everton, City were overwhelming favourites to put Watford to the sword at the Etihad Stadium, with a double from Jesus’ edging them 2-0 in front inside 24 minutes. Watford then briefly threatened to make a game of it as French defender Hassane Kamara’s first goal in English football five minutes later brought the visitors to within one of City. However, a stunning strike from Spain international Rodri restored City’s two-goal advantage in the 34th minute before Jesus completed his first Premier League hat-trick early in the second half after converting from the penalty spot. Not done there, the 25-year-old tapped home his fourth in the 53rd minute to complete the rout. City took their foot off the gas from there on in, with Tuesday’s Champions League semi final first-leg against Real Madrid in mind. The comprehensive victory moved champions City on to 80 points from 33 matches played, four clear of Liverpool ahead of Sunday’s Merseyside derby, while Watford head towards relegation, sitting 19th seven points from safety. The visitors would have been fearing the worst on their trip north. Guardiola had won all 10 of his previous meetings with Watford in all competitions, and by an aggregate score of 42-4, before Saturday’s clash. It did not take long for City to get on the scoresheet once again in the Etihad sunshine, as Jesus, who was heavily linked with a move to Arsenal in the British media this week, reminded Guardiola of what he could do with a poacher’s finish just four minutes in. City had more than 83% possession in the first 15 minutes as they controlled proceedings, adding a second through Jesus again, on the end of a sumptuous cross from Kevin De Bruyne. Kamara’s drilled finish offered Watford only a brief reprieve, from what was their own meaningful attempt on goal all match, with Rodri drawing gasps from all around as he rifled his fourth league goal of the season past helpless Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster. There was no slacking off from City, as just 15 seconds into the second half Jesus was fouled by Foster in the area before, after a lengthy VAR check, getting up to slot home from the penalty spot to complete his treble. A familiar source created the fifth and final goal for City as De Bruyne laid the ball across for Jesus to cap a memorable afternoon for the Brazilian.

Liverpool striker Salah has enjoyed another fine season and is set to claim the Premier League Golden Boot as well as potentially four trophies, while going toe-to-toe with Guardiola and De Bruyne’s Manchester City side. But the coach does not believe his star playmaker will be upset at being named second in the voting, having claimed the gong last year - although Guardiola remarked that he might have been in the running if given a chance. “Congratulations to Salah,” the Spaniard said. “Absolutely not [will City be disappointed].

Jurgen [Klopp] said they have the best keeper, the best second keeper, the best central defender, the best holding midfielder, the best striker in the world - so it’s normal they win all the awards.” Liverpool boss Klopp signed a new long-term contract ahead of the weekend and Guardiola stated that he will not take the German’s situation into account when deciding his own future with City. “Everyone has their situation and if we decide to stay longer, it’s because I decide not because my colleague Jurgen extended,” he said. “I don't see the correlation.” ",positive,Liverpool,2
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-spurs-levy-summer-conte-transfers-b996593.html,Tottenham: Daniel Levy facing huge summer dilemma as Antonio Conte plots transfer overhaul,"aniel Levy is experienced enough to brush off speculation and is used to ignoring noise from his managers, but employing Antonio Conte must occasionally test the Tottenham chairman’s patience. This week, in the wake of Spurs’ frustrating stalemate with Brentford which dented their chances of returning to the Champions League, a fresh round of reports linked Conte with a summer exit, with the head coach rumoured to be interested in succeeding Mauricio Pochettino at Paris Saint-Germain. They raised the intriguing prospect of a sensational job swap between Conte and Pochettino, but Levy will surely be growing exasperated with Conte’s quit threats and rumours of his interest in other jobs — even if the Italian’s camp insist the PSG stories did not come from them. While Pochettino’s likely dismissal by PSG offers Levy an attractive safety net in the event that Conte walks at the end of the season, the danger for the chairman is a repeat of last summer, which he spent searching for a new manager and battling with Harry Kane over his future. These concerns are part of the package in employing Conte, who is notoriously high maintenance and described by one senior figure at Chelsea as making Jose Mourinho “look like a pussycat”. The hard-to-please coach will always demand more and his rhetoric should be viewed, at least in part, as a means of pressuring the club to give him what he wants. Clearly, there is an argument that Levy and managing director Fabio Paratici should do whatever possible to appease Conte in the transfer market this summer. Given Tottenham’s position in the food chain, the chairman may never again have one of the world’s top coaches, at the very peak of his powers, in his employ, and for all the (justified) talk of Pochettino being a better profile of manager for the club, backing Conte still feels like Spurs’ best chance of real success next season. For Levy, it is not quite so simple, though. Conte’s short-term contract, which runs until the end of next season, and his apparent concerns that Spurs do not have the means to compete for the League title, mean Levy and Paratici will have to be particularly careful to sign players who suit both Conte and the club this summer. As Saturday’s draw demonstrated, Conte is rigidly committed to his preferred system and, if he stays in north London, he wants at least six new players — among them two wing-backs and a left-sided centre-half who can play in a back three. He also favours experienced, senior players. Should Daniel Levy back Antonio Conte in the transfer market, knowing he could walk away from Tottenham? Conte tends to leave clubs in a better condition than he finds them but Levy will still be wary of backing the head coach to the tune of millions of pounds on specialist players when there remains a danger he could walk away as soon as he gets a more attractive offer, or at the end of his contract. Levy has already showed an admirable willingness to back Conte, offloading the club’s record signings, Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso, for nothing in January, and signing Dejan Kulusevski — a former Conte target at Inter Milan — and Rodrigo Bentancur from Juventus. Completely reshaping the squad in Conte’s image, however, poses long-term risks while his position and future remain uncertain, so Levy and Paratici must tread carefully. Liverpool’s rebuild under Jurgen Klopp, by contrast, was made easier by his long-term commitment to the club, ensuring they could sign players to suit the German’s approach. Manchester City have done the same with Pep Guardiola but Spurs are disadvantaged both by being more financially prudent than their rivals in the market, and having a rigid tactician whose future is not certain. Spurs have already spent £50million on a centre-half who excels in a back three and spending the same again on a left-footed version of Cristian Romero may not suit, say, Pochettino, who prefers playing a four-man defence (and might have also been happy to work with Lo Celso and Ndombele, as another example). It might be in Conte’s interests to start showing some commitment to Spurs, starting with a new deal The success of Kulusevski and Bentancur offer reasons for optimism, proving that Paratici can find targets to suit the club’s policy of young, versatile players while still satisfying Conte, but this summer will certainly test the relationship between the two Italians, and Levy’s willingness to cede control over big deals to the pair. Paradoxically, in pushing Spurs to back him with a drip-drip of hints and threats, Conte has arguably made it harder for the club to give him everything he wants. It might be in Conte’s interests to start showing some commitment to Spurs, starting with a new deal, if he is to convince the club to go full-throttle behind his vision. ",positive,Liverpool,1

Spurs begin a gruelling run of ten games in 30 days with Thursday night’s home derby against Brentford and Conte has confirmed that Kane, the club’s only senior striker, is unlikely to start them all. Bergwijn has struggled for consistency since joining Spurs from PSV Eindhoven in January 2020 and the winger has been linked with a return to the Eredivisie next month. Under Conte's predecessors, Heung-min Son typically deputised for Kane through the middle, but the Italian wants to keep Son at No10 and revealed he is prepping Bergwijn to play up front. Asked by Standard Sport if Kane would need to be rested this month, Conte said: “I think so and I also think Steven could be a good option [to deputise]. ""In the past I have seen that Son played No9. Honestly, I prefer Son to play as a No10 – in the position that he is now playing. I like to have a point of reference as No9. Steven is working and we are utilising him also in this position [and] in the three positions off the striker. Steven could be a good option on the day that I want to give a rest to Harry.” Bergwijn scored on his first three home appearances in England, including crackers against both Manchester clubs, but his confidence appeared to drain after he missed a glorious chance in the 2-1 defeat at Liverpool in December – which triggered Spurs' slide down the table. He has scored just once for Spurs since the start of last season but Conte says the Netherlands international – who helped his country qualify for the World Cup with a brilliant goal last month – is not alone in lacking confidence. “I honestly think many players have to recover their confidence at Tottenham,” the head coach said. “When you finish the season in seventh, for sure the confidence is not up. This is another aspect we’re working on – to improve [players’] confidence."" Conte added: “[In Steven] we're talking about a player that has important skills. It was a pity for me – but not the [Dutch] national team, because he scored in qualifying – because I would have liked to have him during the two weeks of the international break to work with him and know him much better. “But for sure he has great quality. He's good one-v-one, he's fast, he can beat a man and also score. He's understanding what I want from him. Tonight, he’s ready and available – and I’m counting on him.” Kane has started all four matches under Conte, including the embarrassing defeat to NS Mura last week, and he was named in the XI for Sunday’s postponed visit to Burnley. Getting the best out of the England captain remains one of Conte’s most pressing challenges, with Kane still having scored just once in 11 League appearances. Conte, though, has no doubts about Kane’s enduring quality and says he has only been able to truly appreciate his “level” since working with him at close quarters. “We have a world-class striker as a No9 in Harry and I am very delighted to have the opportunity to work with him because many times you make an evaluation [of a player from] outside [the club],” Conte said. “But only when the coach has the possibility to train players, do you understand their level. With Harry, I was enthusiastic to see him in the way that he works every day and the commitment, heart and passion that he puts into Tottenham. It was not a surprise but when you arrive you do not know what you find. And I found this.” Conte will be without Argentine pair Cristian Romero and Giovani Lo Celso against the Bees, and could name the same XI which was due to start at Burnley before snow forced an 11th-hour delay.

Spurs face a daunting trip to quadruple-chasing Liverpool on Saturday evening before Arsenal host Leeds, who have been dragged into the thick of a three-way relegation fight. With a two-point lead over their bitter rivals, fourth-placed Arsenal will be the more comfortable of the two, and this weekend offers them a good chance to open up a five-point gap on Spurs and potentially a cushion going into the north London derby at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Thursday week. But this is merely a scrap for fourth place, quite different to the relentless nature of the title race between Liverpool and Manchester City. Neither Arsenal nor Spurs have shown enough consistency this season to suggest they are certain to win their three other fixtures, so there should be more twists to come. If Spurs have an X-factor, it is their world-class individuals. In head coach Antonio Conte, they have one of the game’s best, while Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester was made comfortable by the brilliance of Harry Kane, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski at one end and Cristian Romero at the other. Arsenal, by contrast, are lacking the same star quality but feel like a more rounded team under Mikel Arteta, further along in their rebuild than their neighbours. Last month, Brighton and Brentford offered a blueprint of how to nullify Conte’s Spurs — specifically, deny them space in the final third and stop Kane getting on the ball — and, in having a more clearly-defined system, Arsenal are harder to stop and better at breaking down stubborn opponents. Arteta is also getting more from his squad than Conte, and important performances from fringe players Mohamed Elneny, Eddie Nketiah and Rob Holding in the wins over Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham point to a united group, with deceptive depth. By contrast, Lucas Moura was hopelessly rusty on his first Spurs start since mid-February on Sunday, while Harry Winks was off the pace in a late cameo, hardly surprisingly given Conte has barely changed his XI for over two months. Both clubs have been impacted by injuries in the same positions, with Spurs losing midfielder Oliver Skipp and wing-back Matt Doherty, and Arsenal without Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney in similar positions. Mikel Arteta vs Antonio Conte - who will win the race for Champions League qualification? The absences may prove crucial in the run-in. In Nuno Tavares, who is deputising for Tierney at left wing-back, Arsenal have an agent of chaos, and while the Portuguese is in the team there is a chance they will drop points in any game. Kulusevski, who came off the bench to twice assist Son on Sunday, should have the beating of Tavares if they both start on May 12. For all their star quality up front, Spurs, though, are weak on both flanks. In the absence of Doherty and Sergio Reguilon, who is sidelined indefinitely with a groin injury, wing-backs Emerson Royal and Ryan Sessegnon failed to make an impact in the final third against Leicester. But it is long past the point where Conte is likely to change his system or experiment on the flanks. If Arsenal allow Spurs’ wing-backs to have the ball, and keep it away from their forwards, they will be in a strong position next week. Spurs finish the season against Burnley, who are likely to be fighting for survival, and already-relegated Norwich, while Arsenal face a tough trip to Newcastle and host Everton on the final day, when the Toffees may also be playing for their Premier League status. The derby will surely be crucial, but the fight for Champions League football could come down to Spurs’ individual brilliance against Arsenal’s collective cohesion and unity. Whatever happens in the next fortnight, expect the contest to go the wire. ",positive,Liverpool,2

A relatively routine 2-0 victory at Anfield has Jurgen Klopp’s side strong favourites to progress, even despite Unai Emery’s excellence in European competition. The quadruple is very much still on for Liverpool and, barring the kind of turnaround not often seen before in Champions League history, they will soon be in their third cup final of the campaign.

The quadruple-chasing Reds travel to eastern Spain holding a commanding 2-0 lead in their last-four tie after a Pervis Estupinan own goal and Sadio Mane’s second-half effort in a one-sided first leg at Anfield last week. However, manager Jurgen Klopp is not taking anything for granted on the road to Paris, insisting it is a difficult scoreline as Unai Emery pledged to make his side “suffer” in Tuesday’s return clash. Liverpool followed up that dominant win over Villarreal in which they held 73 per cent of the overall possession and allowed only one shot (which was off-target) by triumphing at Newcastle on Saturday, with Naby Keita’s fourth goal of the season in the early Premier League kick-off ensuring they piled the pressure on title rivals Manchester City, who responded with a routine 3-0 victory at Leeds later in the day to regain top spot with four games to go. Much-changed Villarreal, meanwhile, slumped to a disappointing 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Alaves at the weekend, leaving them seventh in LaLiga, four points adrift of the top six and nine behind Atletico Madrid in fourth. Their hopes of playing in Europe at all next season could well now rest on pulling off an incredible comeback against six-time champions Liverpool and winning the whole competition, with either Real Madrid or Manchester City awaiting the winners of this tie in the final at the Stade de France on May 28.

Liverpool will remain without Roberto Firmino on Tuesday, though the Brazilian forward is now back running after nursing a foot issue and is set to travel to Spain with his team-mates. Divock Origi will be assessed after missing the win over Newcastle through non-Covid illness, though Curtis Jones and Kostas Tsimikas are available again. Klopp made five changes in total at St James’ Park, with Mohamed Salah, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ibrahima Konate all moving to the bench. That quintet should return to the starting lineup against Villarreal, though it’s a difficult juggling act with Tottenham visiting Anfield on Saturday evening and the FA Cup Final against Chelsea now less than two weeks away. Mo Salah will return to Liverpool’s starting XI against Villarreal after being rested at Newcastle Klopp is not expecting any players to miss out with a stomach bug that has been in camp of late. Villarreal boss Emery made eight changes of his own against Alaves, with only Samuel Chukwueze, Dani Parejo and Pau Torres retaining their starting berths from Anfield. Former Liverpool full-back Alberto Moreno remains sidelined with a long-term knee injury, but a major boost should come with the return of key striker Gerard Moreno, who sat out the first leg with a hamstring complaint. Raul Albiol and ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin have both shaken off knocks, though Arnaut Danjuma is now struggling with a foot problem after missing training on Monday.

Untroubled Liverpool were entirely comfortable and should unquestionably have won by more as they serenely controlled and dominated proceedings. The wily Emery will have to make big tactical changes for the second leg as they need to put Liverpool under far more pressure from the outset. However, their chances of breaching a mean defence that have now kept four successive clean sheets across all competitions appear slim. Villarreal need to push on and take the initiative in front of their own fans, which will inevitably leave plenty of space in behind for the likes of Salah, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz to exploit. Liverpool to win, 2-0. Villarreal’s only win over Liverpool to date came on home soil back in the first leg of the Europa League semi-finals in 2016, with an injury-time effort from Adrian Lopez.

He has seen too much, both he and Liverpool involved in too many comebacks - usually as perpetrator - from more perilous positions than the one Villarreal find themselves in, to entertain that kind of talk. Still, Klopp’s team selection for Saturday’s trip to Newcastle suggested that beneath the obligatory lip service, cliched chatter of it being “only half-time”, he genuinely feels the job is not done, with Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara all rotated for what was a must-win game. It feels like an age since the quadruple-pursuers last played a match that wasn’t one of those, and while a draw or a one-goal defeat would of course be enough to reach a third Champions League final in five seasons, there is little danger of Klopp’s side hunkering down and looking to ride out a yellow storm at El Madrigal tonight. “We have to be ready to suffer and sit back in moments, but not as a general approach,” the 54-year-old said, highlighting the aggression that has seen them win five out of five away from home in the competition this season, racking up 15 goals across trips to Benfica, Porto, Atletico Madrid and both Milan giants. Liverpool won’t rest on their laurels in tonight’s Champions League semi-final second leg against Villarreal “We didn't win the games by sitting deep and counter-attacking,” he added. ""We tried to play as ourselves and we have to do that again.” Alexander-Arnold, too, warned against the old demon that is complacency but neither Klopp nor circumstances have allowed it to fester in this group. The German’s intensity does not permit half-heartedness even if his team now play with more control than in the thunderous early years of his reign, while the Reds’ new-found depth and blessed fortune with injuries mean individual shirts are on the line every week. One early goal could, of course, swing the tie, but the trouble for Unai Emery and Villarreal is that should Liverpool score it, even without the away goals rule, it would surely signal game over. The Spaniards must be foot-perfect, riding their luck as they did at times in the second leg of their quarter-final against Bayern Munich, staying in the game and showing the ruthless streak that saw off Juventus in a late flurry in the round before that. “We will try to find some weak spots,” Emery said yesterday, before acknowledging that is “something that no one has done this season."" If there is hope for Villarreal, it may lie in the second-leg sloppiness that has left the aggregate scoreline shy of reflecting Liverpool’s dominance of each of their knockout ties to date, though in neither the 6-4 against Benfica nor 2-1 against Inter did the Reds ever look in real danger of an exit. Emery will be boosted by the return of Spain striker Gerard Moreno, but it may be a case of one-in, one-out, with concern over the fitness of top scorer Arnaut Danjuma after the former Bournemouth man missed training yesterday. Liverpool will still be without Roberto Firmino, though the Brazilian has travelled with the squad to Spain. ",positive,Liverpool,6

Son reached 19 goals for the season with a clinical double in Sunday’s 3-1 win over Leicester, making him the outright top scorer from open play in the Premier League and behind only Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah -- on 22 -- in the race for the Golden Boot. Both of Son’s goals came with his supposedly weaker left foot, including a stunning effort into the top corner to make it 3-0, and he also assisted Harry Kane’s opener with a corner. Kane is widely regarded as one of the best forwards in the world but Son is often overlooked in debates about the league’s best marksmen, despite his consistency. Asked about the front five of next weekend’s opponents Liverpool, Sessegnon said he would not swap Kane or Son for anyone and believes the latter is underrated on account of his character. Asked if Son is one of the best in the world, Sessegnon said: ""100 per cent. He has been consistent over the last six or seven years, doing it at the top level and the numbers speak for themselves. ""It’s hard to know why he is underrated because consistently, season after season, his numbers are there. I think it’s because he’s such a down-to-earth, normal guy. He’s not an arrogant person and he’s just very friendly with everyone. That’s probably why [he is underrated]. ""Of course, [Son and Kane] make it much easier for us. They can do special things on the ball and you saw that again on Sunday. Sonny assisted H again and their combination they’ve had ever since playing together is unbelievable. ""No way [would we swap them]. The two players we have [up front] are world class and we wouldn’t swap them for anyone."" Sessegnon’s Spurs career has been revived under Antonio Conte and he is hoping the head coach remains at the club next season, despite his consistent refusals to commit beyond the end of the current campaign. The wing-back insists the speculation over Conte’s future is not a distraction for the squad and says the Italian is helping to restore his confidence after a succession of hamstring injuries. ""Is the speculation unsettling? Not really, not at all,"" Sessegnon said. ""We’re professionals and we focus on our game and step by step. You heard him yourself, [the speculation is] obviously false news, he’s focusing on here at the club. As players we’re just focusing on our job going forward and that’s all we can do. ""Of course I hope he stays, he’s a top manager and he’s shown that with us this season. We hope he’s here next season and for us the main objective is to get in that top four and then prepare for next season. ""It has not been easy [for me] since I’ve been at the club, but step by step he gives me confidence in every game to go and do what I can do,"" Sessegnon added. ""For me it’s about believing in myself and getting in that positive run, feeling good and keep pushing. ""Every day, every game as well learning bit by bit, the defensive side, the attacking side. Of course he’s very demanding and [as a wing-back] you need to be up and down. You almost have to manage yourself when to go, when to relax a little bit, but it is relentless."" Asked if he now has confidence in his body to remain injury-free, the 21-year-old added: ""Definitely. At times it is quite hard, it’s a mental battle with the physical side as well. Right now I feel good and I’m giving 100 per cent every time I’m out there."" Arsenal’s win at West Ham later on Sunday means Spurs remain two points behind their fourth-placed rivals and need to beat quadruple-chasing Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday to guarantee they will be within touching distance of their neighbours in next week’s potentially crucial north London derby. Sessegnon impressed in the 2-2 draw with Jurgen Klopp’s side in December and says both the team and himself can take confidence from that performance. ""We’ll look at the game and see the positives and take those positives into the next game at Anfield,"" he said. ""We know it’s a different stage of the season and we have to manage it. But again when we have the chances to score, we should take those chances. ""I think every game I play in this team gives me confidence to go and do what I want to do on the pitch, especially against the big teams as I played well in the last game when they came here. It’ll be no different going into that game."" ",positive,Liverpool,3

The Portugese superstar’s two-year contract at Old Trafford is not set to expire until June 2023, yet there has been fierce debate over recent months as to whether he should leave for a second time at the end of the season. While Ronaldo has proved United’s saviour on plenty of occasions with 24 goals in 38 appearances across all competitions this term, many have questioned his place in what is expected to be a drastic rebuild of the ailing Red Devils under new permanent manager Erik ten Hag. However, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner appeared to strongly hint that he would be staying put after again enjoying a starring role against Brentford in the Premier League on Monday night. Ronaldo is now only four strikes behind Liverpool leader Mohamed Salah in the Golden Boot race after dispatching a second-half penalty in the morale-boosting 3-0 victory over Brentford. He had earlier seen an initial effort ruled out for offside before the interval. Cristiano Ronaldo enjoyed a starring role again for Manchester United in their 3-0 win over Brentford After emphatically scoring his spot-kick, Ronaldo pointed to himself and then down to the Old Trafford turf, seemingly indicating that he may be staying after all. Then, while soaking up the adulation of the fans during a post-match lap of honour to mark the last home match of a difficult United campaign, he appeared to mouth to the Sky Sports cameras: “I’m not finished.” Interim boss Ralf Rangnick insisted once again after the win over Brentford that any decision on Ronaldo’s future should be deferred to Ten Hag, yet he backed the 37-year-old to remain part of the squad despite his repeated claims that United will need to sign at least two top-class strikers this summer. “The way we played again tonight, not only because he scored he also won the penalty and helped defensively, why should he not be part of the squad and help the team?” said Rangnick. “But this is a question you have to ask Erik and also Cristiano. “Cristiano is not a central striker. He does not want to play in that position but if you look at international football there are not many teams who play with two strikers. “For me, it is a question of what players Manchester United have in the future. It is obvious United need two more quality strikers. Modern strikers do not necessarily have to be strikers. Liverpool or Manchester City have five or six top-class strikers. If you ask me if Gabriel Jesus or Jack Grealish is a winger or a striker, they can all play there. “Mason Greenwood would have been one, then after the West Ham game he was no longer part of the squad.

Last week’s tussle between the respective champions of England and Spain at the Etihad was an instant classic, with early goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus seeing the hosts race into a 2-0 lead inside 11 minutes. City could and should have scored a hatful more before the evergreen Ballon d’Or front-runner Karim Benzema reduced the deficit in trademark fashion, with second-half goals from Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva then sandwiched between a sensational Vinicius Junior effort and followed by an outrageous Benzema Panenka penalty that left a thrilling tie brilliantly poised at 4-3. Despite being ahead, there is a sense of real potential missed opportunity as Pep Guardiola’s Premier League leaders head to the Bernabeu, where Real are typically so dominant, though very nearly came unstuck in humiliating fashion against Chelsea in the quarter-finals.

James Robson will be providing expert analysis from Madrid. City look set to remain without experienced right-back Kyle Walker, who may not play again this season due to an ankle injury suffered in the quarter-final second leg against Atletico Madrid. Defensive colleague John Stones will be assessed after remaining sidelined for the win over Leeds, having limped off last week against Madrid - starting at right-back - in the first half. Guardiola made five changes to his first XI at Elland Road, with Stones, Oleksandr Zinchenko, De Bruyne, Bernardo and Riyad Mahrez replaced by Joao Cancelo, Nathan Ake, Ilkay Gundogan, Jack Grealish and Raheem Sterling. For Madrid, David Alaba is once again facing a race against time to be fit after recovering from a hamstring injury to start in the first leg, only to suffer a setback and go off at half-time. Casemiro is now fully fit, but Eden Hazard remains out as he recovers from an ankle operation and Gareth Bale missed the weekend’s title celebrations with back spasms. Based on the first leg, which was more akin to a basketball match, predicting an exact scoreline between these two attacking powerhouses is a fool’s errand. Last week’s contest was absorbing, chaotic and gloriously eventful, with seven goals scored when in reality it could and should have been well into double figures. City will be kicking themselves that they couldn’t get the job done last week despite their hatfuls of chances, with Real always managing to somehow hang on and prevail in the end. This truly could go either way, but we’re backing Guardiola’s men to narrowly progess in another high-octane affair and book a second consecutive final berth. Man City to win, 3-2.

Widely expected to leave in 2024, Klopp extended his stay until the summer of 2026 on Thursday and will outlast even the great Bob Paisley should he see that deal out in full. Having restored Liverpool to the top of the English and European game already during his tenure, Klopp could see his side win an unprecedented quadruple this season, a feat that would surely rival anything in the club game. With Pep Guardiola’s future at Manchester City beyond 2023 uncertain and Liverpool’s recent transfer business padding out an already successful squad with developing talents, there is every chance the success under Klopp could continue. Alexander-Arnold, however, has insisted the squad are not focusing too much on the future. “Hopefully those extra two years [of Klopp] are as successful,” he said during his pre-match conference. “It’s an increase in success every year with him. This has been special so far. We can make it something special. Hopefully we’ve got 4 more years of that to come. “It wasn’t like it was a big party when he heard. It’s hard for news to sink in when games come thick and fast. “We’ll know when we sit down that it is good news but as a set of lads, we’re focused. He hasn’t spoken about it. Business as usual.” ",positive,Liverpool,3

The Blues slumped to a dismal 1-0 defeat by relegation battlers managed by Frank Lampard at Goodison Park on Sunday after captain Cesar Azpilicueta inexplicably lost the ball to Richarlison, who promptly slotted home what proved to be the winning goal just after half-time. Chelsea were then thwarted by a combination of their own profligacy, the woodwork and an outstanding display from England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford as Everton picked up a vital three points in their fight against relegation from the Premier League and their opponents were left to rue another self-inflicted disappointment. Manager Thomas Tuchel lamented his side’s sudden penchant for critical mistakes, which also cost them against Arsenal last week and in their agonising Champions League quarter-final defeat by Real Madrid. Loftus-Cheek was one of the few Chelsea players to come out of the defeat on Merseyside with any credit, denied a goal by the excellent Pickford and trying to drive his team forward whenever possible on his 50th start for the club. Ruben Loftus-Cheek was one of Chelsea’s few bright lights in their dismal defeat at Everton “We’re all very disappointed,” the 26-year-old told Chelsea’s official website. “Coming into the game we knew it was going to be a hostile atmosphere and it’d be like a final to them. We felt that straight away. “They came out of the blocks second half and caught us napping. We were fighting an uphill battle from then on, the fans were behind them, and it was hard to break them down. It was disappointing. “We’ve made a few mistakes over the past few matches and haven’t kept clean sheets from individual errors. That is how football is, if you keep shooting yourselves in the foot it will be difficult to get out of it.” Chelsea will be desperate to iron out those blunders before they face in-form Liverpool in a domestic cup final for the second time this season at Wembley on May 14. A third defeat in six Premier League games has also loosened their grip further on third place, with resurgent Arsenal now just three points behind and Tottenham five adrift of Chelsea with four matches left to play this term. Asked how Tuchel’s side could go about eradicating those repeated errors, Loftus-Cheek added: “It’s up to us as individuals to tune in and sharpen up as a team together. Getting everyone ready for the game, these are basics in football. “If you don’t have these basics, you will struggle like we have the last four games. This is not Chelsea standard at all. Our concentration levels were not good enough. “We want top four but we cannot perform like that with other teams doing well around us. We need wins. It is hard to process it right now and we will look back at it once the emotions have calmed down. “We had chances to score numerous times. Their keeper made some great saves. If we put them in, I think we could be coming away with a win.” ",positive,Liverpool,1

Tomiyasu made his first Premier League start since January following a lenghty calf problem but was replaced by Cedric Soares after pulling up injured in the 78th minute. Saka, meanwhile, was brought off for Emile Smith Rowe for the final few minutes at the London Stadium and looked to be in some discomfort in the closing stages. Ben White missed the game with a tight hamstring, although it is hoped his problem is not serious. Arteta, who has already lost Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey to injury problems during the run-in, provided a positive update on his players after the game. “Ben got injured against Manchester United, he felt a muscular problem and we checked him, and we will have to assess him in the next few days to see how he is,” he said. “Bukayo was fine, he was really fatigued and he has been through a little injury as well. Tomiyasu has just that he had been out for so long and could not continue.” Arsenal are next in action when they host Leeds United on Sunday, a day after top four rivals Tottenham travel to Liverpool. The two north London heavyweights will then meet on Thursday May 12 in what looks like a straight shootout to determine who qualifies for next season’s Champions League. ",positive,Liverpool,1

The striker scored the only goal of the game in the 46th minute to keep Frank Lampard sides’ fate in their own hands. In the celebrations that followed Richarlison’s goal, a lit blue smoke canister was thrown on to the pitch by supporters. Richarlison responded by picking the object up and throwing it, although it was unclear where it landed. A club spokesperson said: ""We will look into the matter but, as far we we are concerned, Richarlison was attempting to throw it out of the ground."" In February, Liverpool midfielder Harvey Elliott was contacted by the FA after handling a red flare following the side’s Carabao Cup victory at Wembley. Pyrotechnics are banned from football stadiums in England. Everton remain in the relegation zone with five games left to play. But the victory moves them within two points of Burnley and Leeds, with the Toffees having a game in hand on their two rivals. Additional reporting from PA ",positive,Liverpool,1
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/antonio-conte-heung-min-son-tottenham-leicester-b997419.html,Antonio Conte hails ‘fantastic’ Heung-min Son after match-winning display against Leicester,"ntonio Conte praised “fantastic” Heung-min Son after the forward scored twice in Tottenham’s 3-1 win over Leicester - but warned that individual quality will count for little if his side do not finish in the top four. Spurs moved back ahead of Arsenal, albeit possibly temporarily, after Son scored twice in the second half, including a stunning effort into the top corner, against a much-changed Leicester. The South Korean’s first-half corner was headed home by Harry Kane — his 18th goal in 17 appearances against his former loan club — and he twice finished passes from substitute Dejan Kulusevski after the break. Kelechi Iheanacho scored a stoppage-time consolation for the Foxes, who made eight changes ahead of their visit to Roma for Thursday’s Europa Conference League semi-final decider. “I gave him a big hug because after an amazing goal my question was, ‘Which is his favourite foot, right or left?’” Conte said of Son, who scored both goals his his supposedly weaker left foot. “He scored a fantastic goal and three minutes before, when I spoke with him, I said, ‘Go for five or six minutes and then I have to make a change’. “So [after the game] I said to him, ‘You listened that I wanted to make a change and you decide to score this amazing goal!’ “We are talking about a great player, a fantastic player. “But it’s important at the end of the season to celebrate a big achievement with the team. Otherwise it remains only a personal success to score these types of goals.” Spurs moved a point clear of Arsenal, with Conte’s side facing Liverpool at Anfield next weekend and Arsenal playing Leeds, before they meet in a potentially decisive north London derby on May 12. Conte added: “It was a good performance against a really good team. “The game wasn’t easy and we knew very well that despite them making eight changes from the last game against Roma you can see the quality, you can see the squad that Leicester has. “For sure we got three points in an important moment of the season especially because in the next games we are going to face first Liverpool and then Arsenal. “Today it was vital to get three points. There is only one result and a lot of pressure, but I said to my players to live this moment, to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months. “I think no one at the start of the season could imagine Tottenham challenging for a place in the Champions League, especially in November when there was a change [of manager] and for this reason we have to be satisfied that we stay in this position to fight for a big achievement.” Conte also hailed Cristian Romero, who was imperious on the right of Spurs’ back three and helped create their all-important second goal - a close range finish from Son. The Argentine won the ball in a crunching 50-50 with Caglar Soyuncu before Kulusevski slipped in Son. “He played a good game,” the Spurs head coach said. “I think every single player played very well. For us it’s very important to do well with the whole team if we want to get three points. It’s no good to play with one, two or three players playing good. We need the whole team playing well and to find a good balance. When this happens we can win the game.” ",positive,Liverpool,2
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/thomas-tuchel-chelsea-premier-league-top-four-b997416.html,Thomas Tuchel admits Chelsea are ‘never safe’ in top-four race after Everton defeat,"homas Tuchel claims Chelsea are now in a battle to secure top four after just two wins in their last six Premier League games. A 1-0 defeat to Everton continued their shaky end of season form and threatens to drag them back towards to Tottenham and Arsenal in the fight for Champions League places. Tuchel criticised his defence for another costly error that gifted Richarlison the winning goal just after half time. But it was a day when his attack let him down once again – even if it required the brilliance of Jordan Pickford to get Everton over the line. Tuchel said: “I said this many weeks ago that I didn’t feel safe and we are never safe. By the way, if we are in a race for top one, top two or top four, no matter what the race, the last four games to only have four points will never be enough, no matter which race we are in. “We have to take care about ourselves. At the moment we don’t get the points when we play well and deserve more and we lose when we play okay. This is a bad mixture.” Cesar Azpilicueta was caught in possession by Richarlison, who fired the winner at the start of the second half. Tuchel has seen his side dominate possession against Manchester United and Everton in the space of three days, yet his team have only managed one goal and one point from those games. He insists the issue is in defence, not attack. “We knew what was coming and like in the last matches we struggled to have clean sheets,” he said. “In the last four we had one, against West Ham, it is the only win we have and I’m very disappointed. “What can I do? The ball is free, give a goal away, it is the worst thing that can happen to you in this atmosphere. It happens too often. We struggle to play without big mistakes and it is why we struggle to have results.” On his attack he added: “If there is something I can do I will try it, but if I knew about it I would have done it before. “For me the key is to have a clean sheet. Manchester United was a different game. More open, fluid. We finally scored late and conceded straight away. “For me this is more like the game against West Ham and we had a clean sheet and played without any big mistakes and that gives us the chance to score late. “If you install emotion and belief in a stadium like this, you struggle.” Everton fans tried to put Chelsea off by setting off fireworks outside the Liverpool Hilton hotel where they stayed on Saturday night. Tuchel said they did not affect him. “I personally woke up twice at 1am and 3am for one minute and after the noise. I turned around and kept on sleeping.” ",positive,Liverpool,1
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-leicester-premier-league-heung-min-son-b997413.html,Individual brilliance could give Tottenham edge in battle for Champions League football,"eung-min Son and Cristian Romero made the difference as Tottenham got their top-four push back on track and heaped the pressure on to rivals Arsenal with a 3-1 win over Leicester in north London. For the majority of a scrappy game, there was little between Spurs and a much-changed Foxes, who are prioritising Thursday’s Europa Conference League decider against Roma, but the hosts’ individual quality told after the break, with Son scoring twice and Romero imperious at centre-half. The South Korean’s second goal was stunning curling effort from the edge of the box to make it 3-0, leaving Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg with his head in his hands, while Harry Kane showed flashes of brilliance and opened the scoring in the first half with his 19th goal in 18 appearances against Leicester. Kelechi Iheanacho scored a stoppage-time consolation for the visitors, who struck the post through Patson Daka at 0-0 but were undone by Son after Brendan Rodgers made eight chances ahead of the trip to Rome. This was not the most polished or convincing display from Antonio Conte’s side but, at this stage of this season, points are the only thing that matter and the win move Spurs one ahead of Arsenal, who face West Ham in the later kick-off. Kane predictability opened the scoring, making it 17 goals in 14 League games against his former loan club, while Son continued to prove that he does not need to be especially involved in games to be the most important player on the pitch. Romero, meanwhile, was outstanding, a class above in everything he did. The Argentine’s ferocious tackling set the tone for Spurs to kick-on in the second half and actually proved an attacking weapon in itself when he won the ball in the crunching challenge on Caglar Soyuncu in the build-up to Son’s all-important second goal. Dejan Kulusevski was also decisive, responding to being rested by coming off the bench and making both of Son’s goals, the first with a clever pass. But Son was really the star, moving ahead of Mohamed Salah for non-penalty goals this season, suggesting he still remains something of an underrated force. Rather than dominating matches, he is increasingly a clutch player in the final third, assisting or scoring when they need a jolt. He set Spurs on their way with a corner for Kane to stoop and score at the near post. If his first goal was a poacher’s finish inside the box, the second goal was inspired, as Son curled into the top corner with his left foot from 20 yards, leaving Kaspar Schmeichel with no chance. This win was an important reminder that while Spurs remain a work in progress under Conte, they have the individuals at both ends of the pitch to win any of their final four matches, even next weekend’s visit to Liverpool, when Kane and Son should relish the space behind the hosts’ high line. A frustration for Conte is that none of his stars had stepped up in the meek displays against Brighton and Brentford, although a Leicester side who are hard-wired to play on the front-foot were also likely to be a more attractive opponent for Conte’s side. While Arsenal are arguably a more well-rounded side than Spurs, further ahead in their development under Mikel Arteta, if this game is anything to go by, Spurs’ individual brilliance and world-class front two could be an important factor in the race for the Champions League.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-fc-pickford-everton-b997412.html,Magnificent Jordan Pickford display no excuse for Chelsea in latest lacklustre performance,"f not for Jordan Pickford, Chelsea would have won this match. But while the England goalkeeper was in Superman mode, it would be letting Thomas Tuchel’s side off the hook to suggest he was the overriding reason for Everton’s crucial 1-0 win. As inspired as he was, Chelsea were abject. They slept-walked through the first half at Goodison Park, stumbled into the traps Frank Lampard set – and, ultimately, got what they deserved. Absolutely nothing. Cesar Azpilicueta’s error at the start of the second half was seized on by Richarlison and may go a long way towards the Toffees’ Premier League survival. The roar from the home crowd that greeted every challenge won, every heroic moment from Pickford, and the final whistle - underlining just how significant a result this was. As for Chelsea, they felt ill-prepared for the fight they were in for, but – most worryingly for Tuchel – ill-prepared to capitalise on the dominance of the ball Lampard was clearly happy to concede. Chelsea’s manager simply must address this glaring weakness in his team if he is to have any hope of closing the gap to Manchester City and Liverpool next season. In back-to-back games in the North West this week – against Manchester United and Everton – they have bossed possession and chances created and walked away with one goal and one point from a possible six. That is not good enough for any team with realistic ambitions of the title. Which is why his claim that his defence is his biggest concern after these latest dropped points, may not sit too well with supporters. “If there is something I can do, I will try it, but if I knew about it I would have done it before,” Tuchel said. “For me the key is to have a clean sheet. The issue is that we don’t have enough clean sheets.” The ongoing lack of cohesion in his forward line, as well as lack of precision, has cost Chelsea too often this season and their manager cannot turn a blind eye to it. At this point it feels as much to do with personnel as the coaching. This is a problem that has been in place since Tuchel took charge 15 months ago, with the list of strikers who have failed to produce at the point of his attack stretching from Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud to Timo Werner and Romelu Lukaku. With Chelsea desperate for a goal with more than 20 minutes to go, Tuchel left £97.5million record signing Lukaku on the bench. That speaks volumes about the Belgian’s future – but also points to his manager’s failure to get a tune out of him. If a new centre forward is recruited this summer, would there be any confidence that he would thrive where a growing list of others have not? But it is not only the cutting edge. Where is Chelsea’s guile around the box to open up deep-lying defences? They too often rely on the width of Reece James or the injured Ben Chilwell - missing the sort of incisive, intricate football City and Liverpool produce. Mason Mount, deployed as a No10 again, is energetic, but at times his side need craft over graft. These are all areas Tuchel must look at if his side are to find another dimension. It was not until the second half, with Chelsea a goal behind and fortunate not to be two-down that they finally awoke from their slumber. Unfortunately for them, Pickford’s concentration levels were sharp despite his inaction. First the he tipped Mount’s effort from inside the box onto the post, with the ball rolling across to hit the other upright. From the rebound, Azpilicueta fired goalwards, but Pickford was there again to block. Moments later he was flying at the feet of Toni Rudiger to deny the Chelsea from close range – albeit with his face. He would not be beaten. Ruben Loftus-Cheek – one of Chelsea’s few players to try to open Everton up – struck from distance, only for Pickford to get a hand on it again. Even deep into stoppage time, substitute Mateo Kovacic was denied an equaliser when the keeper dived low to claw away from the bottom corner. Pickford celebrated every save like it was a goal – and so did the crowd. Chelsea’s fans, meanwhile, were given nothing to cheer. ",positive,Liverpool,2
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-sir-jim-ratcliffe-bid-owner-b997180.html,Chelsea: Sir Jim Ratcliffe makes sensational late bid to buy club with £4.25billion offer,"ir Jim Ratcliffe, owner of petrochemical giant Ineos, has made a sensational last-gasp bid to buy Chelsea. Ratcliffe, one of Britain’s richest men, has been linked with a takeover of Chelsea in the past but only last month a spokesperson dismissed reports he could succeed Roman Abramovich. The race to buy the club following the sanctioning of Russian billionaire Abramovich had been whittled down to three contenders, with consortiums headed by former Liverpool chairman Sir Michael Broughton, LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly and Steve Pagliuca, who co-owns the Boston Celtics, left in the running after a fourth prospective owner - the Ricketts family - pulled out. The process had been nearing its conclusion, with a preferred buyer due to be announced but 69-year-old Ratcliffe revealed to The Times that he had submitted a late offer to US merchant bank Raine Group - who are overseeing the sale - on Friday morning worth more than £4billion, having held talks with Blues chairman Bruce Buck yesterday. An Ineos statement confirmed: “Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Chairman of INEOS, has made a formal bid for Chelsea FC, for £4.25bn. £2.5bn is committed to the Charitable Trust to support victims of the war, with £1.75bn committed to investment directly into the club over the next 10 years. “This is a British bid, for a British club. We believe that a club is bigger than its owners who are temporary custodians of a great tradition. With responsibility to the fans and the community. That is why we are committing to spending £1.75bn over 10 years that will be for the direct benefit of the club. We will invest in Stamford Bridge to make it a world-class stadium, befitting of Chelsea FC. This will be organic and on-going so that we will not move away from the home of Chelsea and risk losing the support of loyal fans.” Ratcliffe already has significant experience in sport, currently the owner of Ligue 1 side OGC Nice and Tour de France-winning cycling team Ineos Grenadiers. Ineos are also principal sponsors of Formula One world champions Mercedes and sailing’s Ineos Team UK. Their statement continued: “We will continue to invest in the team to ensure we have a first class squad of the world’s greatest players, coaches and support staff, in the men’s and women’s games. “And we hope to continue to invest in the academy to provide opportunity for talented youngsters to develop into first class players. We believe that London should have a club that reflects the stature of the city. One that is held in the same regard as Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich. We intend Chelsea to be that club. “We are making this investment as fans of the beautiful game – not as a means to turn a profit. We do that with our core businesses. The club is rooted in its community and its fans. And it is our intention to invest in Chelsea FC for that reason.” ",positive,Liverpool,1

Back-to-back defeats - a first for the season - to Coventry and Derby have delayed the confirmation of a third Championship promotion in five years (a statistic which tells you all you need to know about how the other two went). But should Marco Silva’s side finish the job at home to Preston tonight, they will have three-and-a-half months to happily look forward to the start of their latest top-flight campaign and, more importantly, crack on with preparing for it. It is little surprise that so much stock is being put in that extended window of opportunity, since so many of the failings of Fulham’s last two tilts at the Premier League had roots in decisions taken (or not) during summers shortened by play-off campaigns and then botched by those in charge. In 2018, a splurge of well over £100million - from which the club are still feeling the FFP ramifications - and 12 new signings failed to produce a functioning team, Slavisa Jokanovic’s side all but doomed by the time he was sacked having taken just five points from their first 12 games. Two years later, there was a resolve to do things markedly differently, with an appreciable but perhaps naive emphasis on fewer and shrewder acquisitions and more faith placed in the players that had won promotion. The result was four successive defeats to start the campaign, a raft of panicked late-window additions and the writing again already on the wall. As David Lloyd, founder of Fulham fanzine TOOFIF, puts it: ""There were 21 or 24 points down the swanny before we even had a back four!"" That so many of those belated arrivals came in on loan meant the bulk of the side that won promotion two years ago was still around to be summoned back into action this season, a core of players including Tim Ream, Bobby Decordova-Reid, Aleksandar Mitrovic, Tom Cairney, Marek Rodak, Harrison Reed and Neeskens Kebano all making significant contributions once again. Several had been effectively shunned by Scott Parker in the Premier League, some allegedly personally as well as professionally, with Mitrovic the most obvious example - it was clear last summer that one or the other would have to go. Parker, still a hugely respected figure at the club and across the game, eventually stepped down and may well join his former employers in stepping straight back up with Bournemouth, but there is little regret at his departure given what Mitrovic has gone on to achieve in destroying the Championship goalscoring record with his 38 strikes and counting this term. Marco Silva has offered a new lease of life to players shunned by former boss Scott Parker The Serbian has epitomised a team improved no end for being handed a fresh slate and a new lease of life by Silva, the aforementioned nucleus supplemented by the likes of Antonee Robinson and Tosin Adarabioyo - defenders of fine potential thrown in at the deep end last season - as well as the outstanding young creative talents of Harry Wilson and the Liverpool-bound Fabio Carvalho. “You've only got to look at the smiles on the players' faces, even from the start of the season,” Lloyd says. “We hit the ground running and it's been goals galore, by and large."" There is little doubt that they represent the best of the three recent promotion-winning Fulham sides. With five games to go, they have already surpassed 2020’s points and wins hauls, scoring a staggering 95 goals (compared with 64 two years ago) and - perhaps best summing up their rampant, flowing football - finding the net at least four times in a quarter of their matches. Unsurprisingly, the question is already of how that will translate to the top division. Comparisons with Norwich, similarly expansive and expressive in winning the Championship last year, are inevitable, since the pair appear to be locked in some sort of perpetual division-trading phenomena. But looking across west London at the more pragmatic and resolute manner in which rivals Brentford have sacrificed some of their second-tier swagger and readily cruised to safety ought to provide the blueprint. Fulham should look to rivals Brentford as a blueprint for how to survive in the top-flight If that has to be the case then it is worth wondering whether the enthusiasm for promotion is retained by a fan base who have so recently created such wonderful memories in the Championship and such chastening ones in the league above. It is, Lloyd says, in part because “you've got to throw in the fact that we've had seasons where fans haven't been able to go” and if tonight is the night on which Fulham supporters can celebrate a deal sealed, it will be the first time they’ve been able to do so in person since a heady day at Wembley almost four years ago. There will still be four matches to play and a title to be clinched but attention will turn swiftly to the summer, when so many lessons must be learned and acted upon if a third yo-yo is to be left only half-complete.

The Reds didn’t ever look in any trouble in the first leg, the only danger to them that frustration grew as the Spanish side kept them at bay in the first-half. But Jordan Henderson’s cross found the back of the net with the help of a deflection off Pervis Estunpinan and less than two minutes later, Sadio Mane had doubled the lead with a smart finish. Villarreal will have home advantage in next week’s return fixture, but that looks unlikely to stop Liverpool sealing a third Champions League final appearance under Jurgen Klopp. Unai Emery’s side made their intentions very clear inside two minutes, when goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli took 30 seconds over a goal-kick much to the outrage of the Kop behind him. Liverpool’s first chance of the match fell to Sadio Mane when he got on the end of a cross from Mohamed Salah, but he was unable to direct his header with the ball slightly behind him. Jordan Henderson’s cross nearly found a way in at the near post, before Luis Diaz had a couple of shots from range saved. Giovani Lo Celso, on loan from Tottenham, made a brilliant block to deny Salah and the Egyptian then shinned an effort over the bar from close range as Liverpool piled on the pressure. They came closest to the opening goal a few minutes before the break when Thiago tried his luck from 30 yards, only to see his brilliant strike smack off the outside of the post. Liverpool had the ball in the back of the net shortly into the second-half as Fabinho finished from close range, but the linesman’s flag quickly went up with Virgil van Dijk offside in the build-up. A brilliant two-minute spell was all it took for the Reds to take complete control of the tie. The ball was worked out wide to Henderson as Liverpool found some rare space, his cross flicked off Estupinan and floated beyond the goalkeeper into the far corner. Emery didn’t have time to consider a change of approach before the lead was swiftly doubled. There was nothing fortunate about this one, with Salah playing a great pass through to Mane and he poked the finish past Rulli at the near post. It was very nearly three midway through the second-half, as Andy Robertson volleyed home from a brilliant Trent Alexander-Arnold cross, but once again the offside flag was swiftly up as he went to wheel away in celebration. Villarreal didn’t threaten to find a way back into the match, managing just a single shot across the 90 minutes, and they’ll need to produce an almost miraculous comeback on home soil next Tuesday if they are to turn the tie around and reach the Champions League final.

The La Liga fell to a 2-0 defeat at Anfield, and are perhaps fortunate to only be taking a two-goal deficit into the second leg after they were utterly dominated by Jurgen Klopp’s side. Jordan Henderson’s cross took a flick off Pervis Estupinan and found the far corner for the opening goal, before Sadio Mane doubled the lead less than two minutes later to give Liverpool a lead they more than deserved. Emery and Villarreal have done superbly to reach the last four for just the second time in the club’s history, but they know they will need to significantly improve if they are to score the two goals they will at a minimum require next week. “We can’t dispute the result because they deserve it,” Emery said. “The first half was defensively good but we didn’t achieve in attack. They had two or three chances to score. “The second half was the same and they pushed and deserved to score. 2-0 is a good difference for them, for us not a good result but we will try to dream and do something different in our home. “The match next week will be very different than tonight. It is very important in our home to change something, maybe tactically. They are going to suffer more than tonight.” ",positive,Liverpool,2

With Manchester City not in action until later on Saturday when they face Leeds, Jurgen Klopp’s side took full advantage to end the Magpies’ run of fix straight home victories. Jurgen Klopp was able to rest Trent Alexander-Arnold, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara and Mohamed Salah from his startling line-up ahead of Tuesday’s decisive Champions League semi-final trip to Villarreal. Liverpool could - and probably should - have won more comfortably in front of a boisterous crowd of 52,281 as they held the upper hand for much of a contest which saw the Magpies’ hopes of a fifth successive league win and a seventh on the trot at home wilt in the face of almost constant pressure. Eddie Howe’s men were never able to build up the kind of head of steam which has eased them clear of the relegation battle, perhaps a reminder of how far they have to go before they can once again compete with English football’s best on a sustained basis. SPONSORED The game kicked off amid a raucous atmosphere which might have increased had Jonjo Shelvey managed to make a better connection with a second-minute shot. Diogo Jota was similarly unable to make the most of a half-chance as the ball dropped to him inside the Newcastle penalty area, but Keita had keeper Martin Dubravka scrambling across his line as his first-time strike flew inches wide of the far post with eight minutes gone. Jordan Henderson volleyed high over from Andy Robertson’s corner with the Reds menacing in possession, which they increasingly started to dominate as Henderson and James Milner were allowed to dictate from the middle of the field. They took the lead with 19 minutes gone when, with the home side appealing in vain for a free-kick following Milner’s challenge on Fabian Schar, Henderson and Jota combined to feed Keita, who stepped inside before dispatching the ball past the helpless Dubravka. Newcastle’s response was tepid with Allan Saint-Maximin dragging a 28th-minute effort harmlessly wide as the visitors denied Bruno Guimaraes time and space to effectively limit his creativity, and Dubravka had to get down well to keep out Sadio Mane’s shot after Luis Diaz had raced away down the right 11 minutes before the break. Miguel Almiron thought he had levelled with six minutes of the half remaining after rounding Alisson, only for an offside flag to dash his hopes, and it took a fine fingertip save by Dubravka to prevent Jota from increasing the visitors’ lead as the whistle approached. Newcastle returned with greater intensity, but with key men Guimaraes and Saint-Maximin still largely curtailed, were unable to cause enough problems to trouble Alisson and his defence unduly, and Dubravka had to be alert to deny Jota and Robertson in quick succession as the hour mark approached. Mane might have killed the game off with 27 minutes remaining but steered his shot wide, and Dubravka had to save from substitute Salah and Jota as Liverpool eased to victory, although Alisson had to be vigilant to keep out Guimaraes’ late strike.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/liverpool-champions-league-chaos-calm-control-quadruple-b996849.html,Liverpool swap Champions League chaos for calm and control to serenely keep quadruple bid on track,"urgen Klopp will always be synonymous with rock ‘n’ roll football, but as his Liverpool team took another giant leap towards what would be the greatest achievement of his - or almost any - managerial career, it was control and calm in which he found most satisfaction. In beating Villarreal 2-0 at Anfield last night, the Reds went a long way to ensuring their quadruple bid will, at the very least, go to the wire and did so without coming out of third gear, the home crowd departing having suffered nothing like the emotional exhaustion that knockout European ties at this ground are renowned for delivering. Their side had enjoyed three-quarters of the possession, barely once been exposed on the break and allowed just one shot, off target. Alisson in the home goal did not make a save until falling on a tame strike three minutes from time as the linesman raised his offside flag anyway. “We wanted to score a third, but from a specific moment on it makes sense that you control the game, and that is what we did,” Klopp said. Not only against the basketball match at the Etihad 24 hours earlier was the contrast stark, but also compared with the Reds’ two previous semi-finals under the German, the frantic 7-6 aggregate win over Roma in 2018 and the famous 4-3 comeback against Barcelona 12 months later. Klopp was asked whether lessons could be learned from the former of those ties, the Reds having been 5-2 up after the first leg at home before almost blowing it as the Italians rallied in Rome, but looked genuinely perplexed as to the relevance. This is a different team, in terms of both personnel and style, typified by the conducting presence of Thiago Alcantara and Fabinho in midfield, who play each game as if they’ve seen it before, like two men watching their favourite sitcom for the thousandth time, aware of what’s about to happen long before it does. In any other season, given this club’s relationship with the European Cup, a Champions League run that now looks almost certain to end in next month’s final would be front and centre. But such serene progress through the rounds has made this one feel as if it has been going on almost in the background, cruising along untroubled while all eyes have been on a domestic tussle with Manchester City. The Premier League still looks the most problematic element of this four-trophy pursuit, but when big games come every three or four days it certainly helps to deal in smooth rides rather than rollercoasters, and the swiftness with which Liverpool have seized command of each of their knockout ties to date has surely played some part in sustaining a quadruple push for so long. Liverpool have one foot in the Champions League Final after a 2-0 win over Villarreal at Anfield Klopp’s side have benefited from a kind draw, yes (though it did not look like that when the one for the group stage was made), but there have been virtually no moments of jeopardy, except perhaps in the 120 seconds between Lautaro Martinez’s goal and Alexis Sanchez’s red card in the last-16 second leg against Inter Milan. There has been no need for moments of Divock Origi-esque, legend-making heroism, either. In fact, the last time Liverpool’s future participation in this competition looked in serious doubt was as Trent Alexander-Arnold was preparing to land a corner on Alisson's head at The Hawthorns last May, before they had qualified for it in the first place. The caveat in all of this is that Villarreal were poor, a team who have clearly earned their spot at this stage of the competition but did not produce a performance worthy of it. Two nights of semi-finals have confirmed suspicions that the Premier League’s two best sides are also the best in Europe Unai Emery has won praise for assembling a team far greater than the sum of its parts but last night the gulf between the sides was of the size you’d expect if glancing at the teamsheets without the knowledge that the Spaniards had already taken care of Bayern Munich and Juventus. Two nights of semi-finals have confirmed suspicions that the Premier League’s two best sides are also the best in Europe. Had it not been for the presence of the world’s best player in opposition at the Etihad on Tuesday, and the nagging air of inevitability that lingers around the Champions League Death Star that is the Bernabeu, we might already be making preparations for an all-English final in Paris. With little fuss, Liverpool are almost there. ",positive,Liverpool,5

Pep Guardiola’s side had to respond after Liverpool beat Newcastle and they did just that, with Rodri heading them in front early on. Leeds made it uncomfortable though and threatened to make City stumble in the race. But Nathan Ake doubled the lead after the break and Gabriel Jesus put the result beyond doubt, before Fernandinho capped the win with the final kick of the match to maintain City’s one-point advantage with four league matches remaining. Their focus now turns to the Champions League, as they travel to the Bernabeu to face Real Madrid on Wednesday. As Liverpool did earlier in the day, Guardiola shuffled his pack with Bernardo Silva and Kevin De Bruyne among those named on the bench. Leeds had a big chance to take a shock early lead, when a City corner was cleared out to the halfway line. Joao Cancelo was the last man and he slipped, allowing Rodrigo to charge clear for the home side. He should really have squared it to Raphinha, but took too long to make his decision and the space disappeared. With 13 minutes on the clock, City scored the opening goal themselves. It was incredibly simple too - Phil Foden swung in a brilliant free-kick delivery and Rodri had space in the box to head into the far corner. A nasty clash of heads between Robin Koch and Aymeric Laporte stopped the match and when it resumed, Leeds had their best spell. They rushed City and created some promising moments, but could not turn those into clear-cut chances. Gabriel Jesus fired straight at the goalkeeper after working space in the box, before Stuart Dallas was forced off with what looked to be a serious injury. The Leeds man clattered into Jack Grealish and in doing so was stretchered off himself. City took complete control of the match after the break and it came through another set-piece. The corner was swung in deep, Ruben Dias won the initial header and it fell to Ake who swept home the finish from close-range. Jesse Marsch moved Jack Harrison and Raphinha to wing-back as he threw everything he could at City in the final 25 minutes at Elland Road, but that left them exposed at times. Raheem Sterling had plenty of joy down the right, while Ilkay Gundogan sent a shot from distance wide before he had another from inside the box blocked. Raphinha went close to halving the deficit and setting up a grandstand finish, with Laporte sliding in brilliantly to deflect the Brazilian’s shot over the bar. Any hopes of a Leeds comeback were ended for good by Jesus with just over ten minutes remaining, finishing emphatically after Foden played him in with a wonderful pass. Cancelo could, and probably should, have added a fourth late on when clean through, before Fernandinho did just that deep into stoppage-time when he rifled it low into the far corner from the edge of the box.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-antonio-conte-top-four-b997102.html,Antonio Conte must use squad to freshen up stale Tottenham after pair of blanks,"ntonio Conte’s view of his Tottenham squad can be summed up by a phrase the head coach has used to explain his reluctance to make substitutions. “I look to the bench, then I look back to the pitch!” Conte has remarked to staff. Conte, in short, is not convinced by his options outside his first XI, and the only changes he has made in 12 matches have been forced by injuries at wing-back. Saturday’s frustrating 0-0 draw with Brentford perfectly demonstrated Conte’s unwillingness to turn to his bench. With Spurs needing a goal to match Arsenal’s earlier win over Manchester United, Conte’s first change was centre-half Davinson Sanchez for Ryan Sessegnon in the 74th minute, while he did not introduce Lucas Moura until four minutes from time. Steven Bergwijn remained unused, which was bizarre in the circumstances, particularly given the Dutchman’s heroics in the last meeting with Sunday’s opponents Leicester, who visit north London on the back of last night’s 1-1 home draw against Roma in the Europa Conference League. Substitute Bergwijn scored twice in stoppage-time as Spurs sensationally won 3-2, despite trailing in the 95th minute, at the King Power Stadium in January. There is a view from some at Spurs that Bergwijn being the match-winner that night may not have been entirely in the club’s best interests. His stunning late show effectively ensured it would be a PR disaster to sell him to Ajax in the final week of January, as Spurs were considering, but he has since played just 175 minutes in the League. Clearly, the club might have been better off selling him and doing a late deal for a wing-back or an attacker Conte really rates. The big issue with Conte’s reluctance to use his full squad is that his first XI quickly ran out of ideas and steam in the matches against Brighton and Brentford and, damningly, Spurs go into Sunday having not had a shot on target for over three hours. Graham Potter’s Seagulls may just have established a blueprint with which to stop Conte’s side — specifically, prevent Harry Kane from getting on the ball and deny the England captain, Heung-min Son and Dejan Kulusevski space in the final third. For all their encouraging progress under Conte, Spurs are still not much better at creating chances against canny opponents as they were under Jose Mourinho. Their wins over Leeds, Everton and West Ham came against sides who all adopted a gung-ho approach, while the thrashings of Aston Villa and Newcastle came after they had been outplayed in the first half but managed to establish a lead, before picking off an opponent who had to chase the game. Until he can make those signings, establishing a Plan B would be a start, but Conte is committed to his approach and appears reluctant to experiment. Among his options would be a switch to a back-four, with Bergwijn or Moura coming in at the expense of a defender, but this risks Spurs’ defensive solidity, which has remained intact. A more realistic move would be to bring either of the above into the front three and move Kulusevski to right wing-back, where the injured Matt Doherty is a miss, as Conte did for the final few minutes against Brentford. The risk there is that the connection between the midfield two and front three is further disrupted without link-man Kulusevski drifting between the thirds. Adding an extra midfield body in Harry Winks is another possibility. The good news for Conte is that Spurs’ next three opponents — Leicester, Liverpool and Arsenal — all have coaches who prefer their teams to have possession and play on the front foot, which should suit the Italian’s approach of absorbing pressure and attacking the space. Conte, though, cannot continue to rely on opponents playing into his team’s hands if Spurs are to overhaul Arsenal again in the battle for fourth. ",positive,Liverpool,1

After Nottingham Forest were beaten at Luton earlier on Good Friday, Marco Silva’s runaway leaders headed to the iPro Stadium for an evening kick-off knowing that victory would rubber-stamp their immediate return to the top-flight with five matches to spare. And prolific Fulham looked to be firmly on course to begin their promotion party, with Fabio Carvalho beating Derby goalkeeper Ryan Allsop just before the 20-minute mark after fine interplay with Bobby Decordova-Reid finished off a typically incisive passing move. The Portuguese winger is expected to join Liverpool when his contract expires this summer, with Shakhtar Donetsk’s Israeli international Manor Solomon lined up as his replacement in a £7million transfer. However, Wayne Rooney’s Derby hit back after the interval, with Crystal Palace loanee Luke Plange enjoying a starring role as he provided an initial close-range finish before forcing Tosin Adarabioyo into a decisive own goal 17 minutes from time. SPONSORED Fulham thought they had got back in front when record-breaking top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic slotted home at 1-1, only for the Serbian striker to be quickly denied by the offside flag. Other results could see the Cottagers promoted by the time they host Preston in their next fixture at Craven Cottage on Tuesday night. Meanwhile, an unlikely victory sees Derby rise from bottom to 22nd and level on points with Peterborough, who beat Blackburn earlier in the day. Both sides are nine points adrift of safety with four games left to play after Reading secured a last-gasp win over Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. ",positive,Liverpool,1

Marco Silva takes his side to Derby on Friday knowing that a victory there will put them within touching distance of automatic promotion. Should Luton beat Nottingham Forest, then Fulham’s place in the Premier League next season will be confirmed. Silva is already planning for the future and is close to agreeing a £7million deal for 22-year-old Israeli Solomon, who has been allowed to leave the Ukrainian club following the Russian invasion. The winger looks set to replace Fabio Carvalho, who will join Liverpool for an initial fee of £5m this summer. Regardless of other results this weekend, two wins — against Derby and then Preston at home on Tuesday — will be enough to take Fulham up. Fulham lost 3-1 at home against Coventry on a rare off-day last Sunday, but Silva insists they are not feeling the pressure of getting over the line. “I don’t see a reason for there to be any pressure,” he said. “It is normal in our job and we have to be comfortable dealing with this pressure and to face the challenge.” Elsewhere in the Championship, Millwall face Preston and Hull over the next four days as they bid to gatecrash the play-offs. The Lions are four points off the top six with five games remaining so cannot afford any more slip-ups. ",positive,Liverpool,1
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-lo-celso-villarreal-conte-b996508.html,Giovani Lo Celso transformed at Villarreal as Antonio Conte proved right after Tottenham struggle,"f all the supposed Premier League rejects, misfits and cast-offs who make up Unai Emery's Villarreal squad against Liverpool tonight, none feel as important to their hopes of another Champions League upset as Tottenham loanee Giovani Lo Celso. Lo Celso has added guile and grit to Emery's midfield and was outstanding as Villarreal eliminated first Juventus then Bayern Munich in the knockouts. Lo Celso was man of the match in the 1-0 win over Bayern in the quarter-final first leg, and pivotal again in the subsequent 1-1 draw in Germany, playing both games with a fizzing intensity which the Bundesliga giants found difficult to contain. He got the pre-assist for both the Yellow Submarine's goals across the tie. The performances could scarcely have been more contrasting to Lo Celso's limp efforts in his final months at Spurs, when the simplest of tasks looked beyond him and supporters grew increasingly exasperated with his inability to impact matches. The Argentine's turnaround since returning to Spain on January deadline day has not come entirely out of the blue, however, but rather feels like the result of a talented player being back in an environment which suits him. Giovani Lo Celso has revitalised his career since leaving Tottenham for Villarreal on a loan deal in January This is certainly the view of Spurs boss Antonio Conte, who regards the midfielder as gifted but ill-suited to the intensity and physicality of English football and judged that he needed to be playing regularly back on the continent. Conte has a point. Lo Celso enjoys dribbling and likes to release the ball late, when he has drawn in an opponent and space has opened up ahead, making him susceptible to challenges. His pass in the build-up to Samuel Chukwueze's decisive goal at Bayern was a good example. In LaLiga and the Champions League, Lo Celso is afforded more time and is said to feel more protected, and therefore more comfortable, than in English football. Before joining Spurs he had practically never been injured but two-and-a-half years of hard knocks in England led to a succession of niggles and more serious complaints, which sapped his confidence and disrupted his rhythm. His commitment to playing for his country, even while Argentina was on the UK's ""red list"" of travel destinations, further contributed to his stop-start season at Spurs and frustrated the club, particularly given the view that Lo Celso was the ringleader in September, when he, Cristian Romero and Davinson Sanchez reported for international duty against the club's wishes and subsequently spent 10 days training in Croatia to avoid a spell in quarantine. That said, Conte's predecessors Jose Mourinho and Mauricio Pochettino admired Lo Celso, and he looked more than capable of playing in England during Project Restart, when he was the heartbeat of Mourinho's improving Tottenham side. While many at Spurs found Lo Celso stand-offish, Mourinho liked his quiet determination and said in July 2020 he would not swap him for ""any player"". Last season, injuries and a loss of form largely reduced Lo Celso to the role of alternate for Tanguy Ndombele, who could rarely maintain his intensity for longer than an hour, and Mourinho's seeming lack of trust in him continued under Conte. Lo Celso spent last season at Spurs as an alternate for the disappointing Tanguy Ndombele By contrast, Emery, who managed Lo Celso at Paris Saint-Germain, has placed enormous faith in the 26-year-old, and regards him as a tactically intelligent player who can carry out specific jobs. Lo Celso has quickly become the leader of Villarreal's defensive press, and he is expected to play off the right in tonight's semi-final first leg to deal with the threat of left-back Andy Robertson, just as he did so successfully against Bayern. While Lo Celso's lack of a defined position was a problem at Spurs, Emery enjoys his versatility and will move him around during matches to suit the situation. There is also a view that Lo Celso may prefer being a bigger fish in a smaller pond, having struggled at PSG and Spurs but shone for Real Betis and Villarreal, who are seventh in LaLiga and will need to win the Champions League to return to the competition next season. Villarreal are desperate to keep Lo Celso but his loan deal does not include an obligation to buy at the end of the season, and Spurs want to recoup as much of the £55million fee they paid Betis as possible. Villarreal have never spent more than £21m on a player and are likely to push for another loan deal. Given Lo Celso’s impact for Villarreal, Spurs could find he has no shortage of suitors in the summer One intriguing hypothetical would be the return of Pochettino from PSG to north London in a job swap with Conte, which has been mooted this week. Lo Celso was signed on Pochettino's watch and he may be more open to keeping his compatriot than Conte. Given Lo Celso's impact for Villarreal, Spurs could find he has no shortage of suitors in the summer, however, particularly if he impresses again at Anfield tonight. ",positive,Liverpool,1

The first leg takes place at Anfield on Wednesday evening after Emery overcame European powerhouses in Juventus and Bayern Munich in the previous two rounds. A master of European competition after winning the Europa League on four different occasions across two clubs, Emery has tasted success against Klopp before. One of his Europa League victories came at Liverpool’s expense, beating Klopp’s side 3-1 while manager of Sevilla after a second-half comeback in the 2016 final. After overcoming two of the biggest names in the game - with those wins following up on the win over Manchester United in last season’s Europa League final - Emery is once again proving to be a master tactician in the game. Speaking in his pre-match press conference on Tuesday, Klopp paid tribute to the former Arsenal boss. “Unai is a detail-obsessed manager who prepares for all different situations in the game and that’s what his team is executing,” he said. “It’s really, really good, different ways to build-up, different ways to press, different ways to react on results. “He is a world class coach is doing an incredible job there. “Our job is to make life difficult as possible for them and that is what we will try and do over the two legs.” ",positive,Liverpool,1
https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/liverpool-villarreal-unai-emery-jurgen-klopp-champions-league-b996749.html,Patient Liverpool find solution to Unai Emery’s plotting to close in on another Champions League final,"nai Emery, Jurgen Klopp had said ahead of kick-off, is a man with a plan for every occasion. A good job then, that the German knows his way around a yellow wall. Having stifled Bayern Munich in the previous round, limiting Robert Lewandowski & Co. to just one goal across 180 minutes, Emery and his Villarreal side arrived at Anfield intent on making this semi-final first-leg a non-event and turning the tie into a one-off shootout at El Madrigal in a week’s time. Instead, they were undone by a quickfire double at the start of the second-half that has Klopp’s quadruple chasers on the brink of the Champions League final, knowing only a collapse in that return six days from now will deny them a third trip to the European showpiece in five seasons. By the time they travel to the continent, Liverpool’s pursuit of four trophies will have already gone deeper into a season, in date terms, than any English team in history and, thanks to Jordan Henderson’s deflected cross and Sadio Mane’s finish three minutes later, they are well on their way to becoming the first to play in all three major cup finals in the same season, too. This was not a vintage Reds display and certainly not a match to rival that served up by Manchester City and Real Madrid 24 hours earlier, either. But where City threatened to blow their opponents away, Liverpool prioritised control, never troubled defensively and always likely to win this game by however many they managed to score. The result is that, unlike Pep Guardiola’s men, they will take a two-goal cushion to Spain. Villarreal, for their part, offered up the kind of defensive resistance that Real seemed to have no interest in. Unfortunately, they did not have Karim Benzema at the other end, nor even their own next-best-thing, with Spain striker Gerard Moreno not fit enough even for the bench after a hamstring problem. Their stall was set out from the start. Francis Coquelin played in a four-man midfield containing two holders and was not one of them. Juan Foyth did as good a job as anyone has since his January arrival on these shores of shackling Luis Diaz, aided by the diligence of Giovani Lo Celso. Dani Parejo and Etienne Capoue stationed themselves almost on the toes of their centre-halves, cramping the edge of the box and allowing the likes of Thiago Alcantara all sorts of freedom at anything more than arm’s length, which almost backfired spectacularly when the Spaniard came within inches of a first-half wondergoal, striking some combination of bar and post. All the old tricks were in play, too. Geronimo Rulli took an age over his first goal-kick after just two minutes and continued to do so with admirable consistency. Each time he feigned to play short before ushering his defenders forward, as if only remembering in the nick of time that, against the best pressing team on the planet, that might be unwise. When just a minute was added at the end of the first-half, there were groans from The Kop aplenty. The romanticism of this town of 50,000 weighing in behind a merry band of Premier League cast-offs has afforded them licence to play in this way and Emery, for all his conservatism here, does not inspire the kind of snide fury that courses through, say Diego Simeone’s Atletico Madrid. Still, it was not pretty. Even so, Liverpool’s quality was already threatening to tell. Mane timed his run perfectly but flicked wide from Mo Salah’s superb cross, the pair combining in near-identical fashion to Riyad Mahrez and Kevin de Bruyne for City’s opener 24 hours earlier. A raking fifty-yard pass from Andy Robertson was met with a brilliant first-time cross on the volley from Trent Alexander-Arnold, who picked out Salah, the Egyptian just failing to do likewise with the top corner. It was not individual quality, in the end, that did the trick, but an appreciable lifting of the tempo immediately after half-time and a bit of good fortune, as Henderson’s cross took a nick off Pervis Estupiñán, the change of direction enough to do for Geronimo, who could only flap into his own net. In Emery’s blueprinting of every possible scenario, the folder marked ‘going a goal behind’ must surely have been fairly near the top of the pile. He will have no doubt stressed the importance of dodging the old one-two. But when Liverpool tails are up and Anfield is in full voice, that is easier said than done and Salah soon slid Mane home to poke in a second. There has at times felt like a sense of destiny about Villarreal’s European run. Against a club who know all about that, however, they have surely reached the end of the road. ",positive,Liverpool,4

Overwhelming favourites against the Spanish side even before a ball was kicked in the tie, the Reds have one foot in the final in Paris after a 2-0 victory at Anfield on Wednesday night. Jordan Henderson’s cross deflected in off Pervis Estupiñán soon after half-time before Sadio Mane gave the Reds breathing space ahead of next week’s return. Villarreal have seen off Juventus and Bayern Munich to reach only the second semi-final in their history, but face a huge task to overturn the deficit against Klopp’s quadruple chasers. “It was a brilliant game,” Klopp said. “The first half I liked a lot - we didn’t score, that was the only problem that we had. But we kept them quiet, which was important because of the counter-attacking threat. “We tried to create, tried to be direct, mix it up, play through the lines. We had a lots of good moments, no goals, true, but I was really fine with the first half. “And then in the second half, obviously we finished the situations off. Both goals were outstanding. We wanted to score a third, but from a specific moment on it makes then sense that you control the game, and that is what we did. “It’s half-time, nothing else, but it’s better than before the game.” ",positive,Liverpool,1

Klopp made five changes to his side for the Saturday lunchtime kick-off following a tight turnaround from Wednesday night’s Champions League victory over Villarreal. The German left the likes of Mo Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara on the bench but Naby Keita’s goal ensured the Reds kept up the pressure on Manchester City, climbing to the top of the table, at least until the defending champions play Leeds later on Saturday.

Coming here with five changes and building pretty much a new setup is really difficult, so the performance was absolutely outstanding. I loved it. We controlled the game in so many ways.

The champions romped to a big win over relegation-threatened Watford on Saturday to briefly move four points clear of Liverpool as Gabriel Jesus scored four times in a 5-1 win. With title rivals Liverpool not in action until Sunday against Everton, City were overwhelming favourites to put Watford to the sword at the Etihad Stadium, with a double from Jesus’ edging them 2-0 in front inside 24 minutes. Watford then briefly threatened to make a game of it as French defender Hassane Kamara’s first goal in English football five minutes later brought the visitors to within one of City. However, a stunning strike from Spain international Rodri restored City’s two-goal advantage in the 34th minute before Jesus completed his first Premier League hat-trick early in the second half after converting from the penalty spot. Not done there, the 25-year-old tapped home his fourth in the 53rd minute to complete the rout. City took their foot off the gas from there on in, with Tuesday’s Champions League semi final first-leg against Real Madrid in mind. The comprehensive victory moved champions City on to 80 points from 33 matches played, four clear of Liverpool ahead of Sunday’s Merseyside derby, while Watford head towards relegation, sitting 19th seven points from safety. The visitors would have been fearing the worst on their trip north. Guardiola had won all 10 of his previous meetings with Watford in all competitions, and by an aggregate score of 42-4, before Saturday’s clash. It did not take long for City to get on the scoresheet once again in the Etihad sunshine, as Jesus, who was heavily linked with a move to Arsenal in the British media this week, reminded Guardiola of what he could do with a poacher’s finish just four minutes in. City had more than 83% possession in the first 15 minutes as they controlled proceedings, adding a second through Jesus again, on the end of a sumptuous cross from Kevin De Bruyne. Kamara’s drilled finish offered Watford only a brief reprieve, from what was their own meaningful attempt on goal all match, with Rodri drawing gasps from all around as he rifled his fourth league goal of the season past helpless Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster. There was no slacking off from City, as just 15 seconds into the second half Jesus was fouled by Foster in the area before, after a lengthy VAR check, getting up to slot home from the penalty spot to complete his treble. A familiar source created the fifth and final goal for City as De Bruyne laid the ball across for Jesus to cap a memorable afternoon for the Brazilian.

https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-spurs-levy-summer-conte-transfers-b996593.html,Tottenham: Daniel Levy facing huge summer dilemma as Antonio Conte plots transfer overhaul,"aniel Levy is experienced enough to brush off speculation and is used to ignoring noise from his managers, but employing Antonio Conte must occasionally test the Tottenham chairman’s patience. This week, in the wake of Spurs’ frustrating stalemate with Brentford which dented their chances of returning to the Champions League, a fresh round of reports linked Conte with a summer exit, with the head coach rumoured to be interested in succeeding Mauricio Pochettino at Paris Saint-Germain. They raised the intriguing prospect of a sensational job swap between Conte and Pochettino, but Levy will surely be growing exasperated with Conte’s quit threats and rumours of his interest in other jobs — even if the Italian’s camp insist the PSG stories did not come from them. While Pochettino’s likely dismissal by PSG offers Levy an attractive safety net in the event that Conte walks at the end of the season, the danger for the chairman is a repeat of last summer, which he spent searching for a new manager and battling with Harry Kane over his future. These concerns are part of the package in employing Conte, who is notoriously high maintenance and described by one senior figure at Chelsea as making Jose Mourinho “look like a pussycat”. The hard-to-please coach will always demand more and his rhetoric should be viewed, at least in part, as a means of pressuring the club to give him what he wants. Clearly, there is an argument that Levy and managing director Fabio Paratici should do whatever possible to appease Conte in the transfer market this summer. Given Tottenham’s position in the food chain, the chairman may never again have one of the world’s top coaches, at the very peak of his powers, in his employ, and for all the (justified) talk of Pochettino being a better profile of manager for the club, backing Conte still feels like Spurs’ best chance of real success next season. For Levy, it is not quite so simple, though. Conte’s short-term contract, which runs until the end of next season, and his apparent concerns that Spurs do not have the means to compete for the League title, mean Levy and Paratici will have to be particularly careful to sign players who suit both Conte and the club this summer. As Saturday’s draw demonstrated, Conte is rigidly committed to his preferred system and, if he stays in north London, he wants at least six new players — among them two wing-backs and a left-sided centre-half who can play in a back three. He also favours experienced, senior players. Should Daniel Levy back Antonio Conte in the transfer market, knowing he could walk away from Tottenham? Conte tends to leave clubs in a better condition than he finds them but Levy will still be wary of backing the head coach to the tune of millions of pounds on specialist players when there remains a danger he could walk away as soon as he gets a more attractive offer, or at the end of his contract. Levy has already showed an admirable willingness to back Conte, offloading the club’s record signings, Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso, for nothing in January, and signing Dejan Kulusevski — a former Conte target at Inter Milan — and Rodrigo Bentancur from Juventus. Completely reshaping the squad in Conte’s image, however, poses long-term risks while his position and future remain uncertain, so Levy and Paratici must tread carefully. Liverpool’s rebuild under Jurgen Klopp, by contrast, was made easier by his long-term commitment to the club, ensuring they could sign players to suit the German’s approach. Manchester City have done the same with Pep Guardiola but Spurs are disadvantaged both by being more financially prudent than their rivals in the market, and having a rigid tactician whose future is not certain. Spurs have already spent £50million on a centre-half who excels in a back three and spending the same again on a left-footed version of Cristian Romero may not suit, say, Pochettino, who prefers playing a four-man defence (and might have also been happy to work with Lo Celso and Ndombele, as another example). It might be in Conte’s interests to start showing some commitment to Spurs, starting with a new deal The success of Kulusevski and Bentancur offer reasons for optimism, proving that Paratici can find targets to suit the club’s policy of young, versatile players while still satisfying Conte, but this summer will certainly test the relationship between the two Italians, and Levy’s willingness to cede control over big deals to the pair. Paradoxically, in pushing Spurs to back him with a drip-drip of hints and threats, Conte has arguably made it harder for the club to give him everything he wants. It might be in Conte’s interests to start showing some commitment to Spurs, starting with a new deal, if he is to convince the club to go full-throttle behind his vision. ",positive,Liverpool,1

Asked by Standard Sport if Kane would need to be rested this month, Conte said: “I think so and I also think Steven could be a good option [to deputise]. ""In the past I have seen that Son played No9. Honestly, I prefer Son to play as a No10 – in the position that he is now playing. I like to have a point of reference as No9. Steven is working and we are utilising him also in this position [and] in the three positions off the striker. Steven could be a good option on the day that I want to give a rest to Harry.” Bergwijn scored on his first three home appearances in England, including crackers against both Manchester clubs, but his confidence appeared to drain after he missed a glorious chance in the 2-1 defeat at Liverpool in December – which triggered Spurs' slide down the table. He has scored just once for Spurs since the start of last season but Conte says the Netherlands international – who helped his country qualify for the World Cup with a brilliant goal last month – is not alone in lacking confidence. “I honestly think many players have to recover their confidence at Tottenham,” the head coach said. “When you finish the season in seventh, for sure the confidence is not up. This is another aspect we’re working on – to improve [players’] confidence."" Conte added: “[In Steven] we're talking about a player that has important skills. It was a pity for me – but not the [Dutch] national team, because he scored in qualifying – because I would have liked to have him during the two weeks of the international break to work with him and know him much better. “But for sure he has great quality. He's good one-v-one, he's fast, he can beat a man and also score. He's understanding what I want from him. Tonight, he’s ready and available – and I’m counting on him.” Kane has started all four matches under Conte, including the embarrassing defeat to NS Mura last week, and he was named in the XI for Sunday’s postponed visit to Burnley. Getting the best out of the England captain remains one of Conte’s most pressing challenges, with Kane still having scored just once in 11 League appearances. Conte, though, has no doubts about Kane’s enduring quality and says he has only been able to truly appreciate his “level” since working with him at close quarters. “We have a world-class striker as a No9 in Harry and I am very delighted to have the opportunity to work with him because many times you make an evaluation [of a player from] outside [the club],” Conte said. “But only when the coach has the possibility to train players, do you understand their level. With Harry, I was enthusiastic to see him in the way that he works every day and the commitment, heart and passion that he puts into Tottenham. It was not a surprise but when you arrive you do not know what you find. And I found this.” Conte will be without Argentine pair Cristian Romero and Giovani Lo Celso against the Bees, and could name the same XI which was due to start at Burnley before snow forced an 11th-hour delay.

Deadline day reaction: Aubameyang signs; Dele to Everton; shirt numbers; done deals,"ransfer news LIVE! Deadline Day is over with Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United making no significant additions to their squads. Tottenham had a busy day, with Juventus duo Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur becoming the first signings of the Antonio Conte era, while Tanguy Ndombele completed his return to Lyon on loan, Giovani Lo Celso went to Villarreal and Dele Alli joined Everton in a dramatic late deal. Arsenal have not added to their ranks, beyond Auston Trusty who will stay at Colorado Rapids, despite reports linking them to moves for Alvaro Morata and Alexander Isak, but did see a further departure. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang joined Barcelona on a free transfer, with an announcement expected on Tuesday morning. Ousmane Dembele was linked with both Chelsea and Manchester United in recent days, with reports suggesting a move to PSG has broken down, but will stay at Barcelona. Meanwhile, Kylian Mbappe is said to have decided to join Real Madrid. SPONSORED Liverpool have already secured Luis Diaz, and tried to make late swoop for Fulham’s Fabio Carvalho, but could not complete the move in time. There were no incomings as expected at Crystal Palace, though they have made Jean-Philippe Mateta’s move a permanent one. Donny van de Beek has joined Everton, while West Ham‘s hopes of re-signing Jesse Lingard are over, with Man United not willing to let him leave this month. Newcastle have signed Brighton defender Dan Burn before the deadline but their move for Hugo Ekitike has collapsed. In the other major done deals of the day, Manchester City have landed Julian Alvarez, Rangers have signed Aaron Ramsey on loan and Christian Eriksen has joined Brentford for six months. Follow transfer deadline day LIVE with Standard Sport’s blog below! It’s been a long month and there’s been plenty to keep track of in the Premier League. Dele Alli to Everton, Christian Eriksen to Brentford and Philippe Coutinho were some of the most notable moves made. Here’s a full list of every incoming deal made by top-flight clubs in the January window. Just 16 months after signing a lucrative three-year contract and vowing to become an Arsenal legend, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left under a cloud, writes Simon Collings. Aubameyang was exiled by Mikel Arteta after being stripped of the captaincy following a disciplinary breach that ultimately led to a sad end to his time at Emirates Stadium. He has not played a minute since December, was dropped from the squad and Arteta said he failed to demonstrate the “commitment and passion” to play for the club. Clearly, their relationship was broken beyond repair. Read the full story here on the long-term thinking behind Arsenal’s bold decision. It’s the one we’ve been waiting for! Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s free transfer to Barcelona has officially been confirmed by Arsenal. Aubameyang was pictured arriving in Barcelona on Monday lunchtime, when the clubs were in talks over a potential loan move, but as reports emerged that the deal had broken down it was suggested he had only been in the Spanish city to visit family. However, the deal was revived late in the day as a permanent transfer, signalling the end of the forward’s Arsenal career. Read the full story here. Arsenal’s January transfer window was a tale of frustration and, ultimately, the failure to strengthen the squad will ramp up the pressure to spend in the summer, writes Standard Sport’s Simon Collings. Mikel Arteta was bullish throughout last month about the need for Arsenal to “maximise every window” and, while that may have been the case with outgoings, it wasn’t so with incomings. Read the full story. Chelsea have confirmed the signing of Mason Burstow from Charlton, with the teenager heading back to the Valley on loan. Read the full story. Dele Alli paid special tribute to Mauricio Pochettino as he bid farewell to Tottenham after seven years at the club. Everton signed the midfielder on an initial free transfer, which could reach £30million, on transfer deadline day. It ended Dele’s long association with Spurs, and he thanked the club and fans for their support. Notably, former boss Pochettino and his staff were thanked for their “trust and guidance” during the early part of his career in North London. He wrote on social media: “It’s the end of the chapter but not the book. Thank you all for the messages.” Read the full story. Newcastle confirm the loan exit of Jack Young to Wycombe on loan. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was pictured in Barcelona kit for the first time on Tuesday - as he underwent a training session before his move from Arsenal was officially announced. The final details and paperwork were completed overnight for the Gabonese striker’s free transfer to the Camp Nou. Read the full story. Thomas Tuchel was left frustrated by the failure to cover Chelsea’s injury crisis during the January window, writes Standard Sport’s James Robson. But the German – who warned the season could be wrecked if no mid-season additions were made – will be boosted by the return of Reece James, Andreas Christensen and Trevoh Chalobah this month. Tuchel’s main priority was always to bring in longer-term targets if they became available in January. And the focus will be on stamping more of his mark on the squad in the summer, with a host names already identified. Read the full story. Barcelona president Joan Laporta has claimed that Ousmane Dembele has already found his next club after rejecting a move to the Premier League on deadline day. Chelsea were strongly linked with the French winger, who was available for a move after negotiations over a new Barcelona contract collapsed. Instead, he will now leave as a free agent in the summer. “The Dembele thing is difficult to understand,” Laporta told a press conference on Tuesday. “Dembele is in the team and Xavi has to build a competitive squad with players who have a future at this club. “We think that Dembele already has a contract with another club, they have insinuated that to us. What we will do is defend the interests of our club.” Read the full story. ",positive,Liverpool,1

Neville is a Red Devils legend and made more than 600 appearances for the club in an illustrious career that spanned from 1992 to 2011. He won 20 trophies during his time at the club, which included eight Premier League titles. There is still plenty of affection for the former right-back at Old Trafford and one fan was even sporting a unique scarf in Neville’s honour during their 3-0 win over Brentford on Monday. The Sky Sports cameras panned to the man in question, and Keane and Carragher couldn’t let the opportunity pass. “There must have been a sale on,” former Manchester United captain Keane said. Host David Jones said: “I’m sure they’ll catch on.” Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher added: “Gary Neville or Teabag?”  The Liverpool legend referencing that Neville has an uncanny likeness to the Prison Break character. Keane had some very kind words about Neville later on in Monday Night Football, though, as he picked him in his all-time Manchester United XI. The former midfielder said about the former England right-back: “Brilliant. He was a brilliant player. “He was a brilliant character in a sense, he would go to bed at 8.30pm in the evening and we would criticise him. We all embraced Gary. Gary fell into the group, no problem. “In fairness, when you get into the first team, Gary became more vocal. There’s no stopping him now. Looked after himself.

https://talksport.com/football/1100217/arsenal-transfer-news-lautaro-martinez/,Arsenal to renew interest in Inter Milan star Lautaro Martinez with transfer hinging on Champions League with Man United also keen,"Arsenal have renewed their interest in signing Inter striker Lautaro Martinez. According to The Times, the Gunners are hoping their improved chances of playing in next season’s Champions League could help them in luring the 24-year-old to the Premier League. Martinez has been hugely impressive for the Italian giants this term having scored 21 goals for Simone Inzaghi’s side, which has kept a number of European rivals on alert. This includes Manchester United who could reportedly offer Anthony Martial in exchange. And while Martinez is among the top targets for Mikel Arteta’s side, he’s not the only player whom the Spaniard is after. Gabriel Jesus of Manchester City and Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin are also said to be on the club’s radar as they prepare to revamp their forward line this summer. Arsenal’s hopes of signing Martinez could hinge on their ability to finish the season in the top four. The Gunners are sitting in fourth in the Premier League at present, two points clear of rivals Tottenham, however, with a north London derby just around the corner, talkSPORT host and former Tottenham midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes it’s Spurs who will pip Arsenal to the final Champions League spot.  He told thetalkSPORT Breakfast: “We’ve got to get through Liverpool which is a tough fixture and I’ll be surprised if we get anything from that, but both Arsenal and Tottenham are where they are because they have inconsistent performances. “If we’re talking about winning all of our games between now and the end of the season, we’d be like Chelsea and Liverpool. “We’ll slip up and Arsenal will slip up. We’ve got the north London derby which will be the biggest north London derby in recent times and that is a huge, huge fixture. “I just fancy us, under the lights with the players that we’ve got and the front three that we’ve got. If we step up I think we can turn them over, I really do. “This is a young Arsenal side and credit to them, no one expected them to be where they are and it was a big performance against West Ham and they’re a good young team. “But I think that Spurs have just got a little bit more experience than them and when the pressure’s on, we might just find a way to get it done.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

https://talksport.com/football/1100102/cristiano-ronaldo-man-utd-jamie-carragher-liverpool-erling-haaland-transfers/,"‘Small club’ – Jamie Carragher slams Manchester United’s decision to re-sign Cristiano Ronaldo, saying Erik ten Hag should look to sign Erling Haaland this summer","Manchester United’s move to re-sign Cristiano Ronaldo last summer made Jamie Carragher think they were ‘a small club’, the Liverpool legend has revealed. The Red Devils have endured a difficult season by their own high standards, but the 37-year-old has been a rare shining light with his tally of 18 Premier League goals this term matching his final season at Old Trafford before leaving for £80miilion in 2009. Speculation is building about Ronaldo’s future at the club with a return to Real Madrid suggested as a potential solution, however that will depend on Erik ten Hag’s plans when he arrives this summer. With a big rebuild tipped, talk has started about how United can close the gap on the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City who are running away at the top of the tabl. And, according to Carragher, it’s time that United started focusing on long-term solutions if they’re to restore their status as one of Europe’s top teams. Speaking to Sky Sports, Carragher said: “I see Manchester United as one of the super clubs of world football, and I just look at the others ones like Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Juventus, Barcelona; the ones who have won Champions Leagues. “Even Liverpool right now. Would Liverpool go and bring back Luis Suarez? I don’t think they would, even if they knew he was going to get 20 goals. “Manchester United, for me, should be signing [Erling] Haaland this summer. Man City are getting Haaland, while United have got Ronaldo.   “He is a legend and one of the best goalscorers of all time, and I get that – but it almost made me think that United are a small club. “It reminded me of Wayne Rooney going back to Everton. They knew they weren’t going to win something when Rooney came back but it gives everyone a lift, Wayne’s happy to go back.” Former Man United captain Roy Keane chimed in, saying: “It felt like a short-term fix. [ “[It was] for the fans, the share price and all that, but yeah, he’s still scored the goals that you thought he would do. “As you’ve said, Jamie, I think Man United have got bigger problems than Ronaldo, but it’s something that has to be looked at.”  Signing a new-look attack will be the main priority for United this summer but, according to Ralf Rangnick, that may not come in the form of a traditional number nine. The interim head coach explained: “For me, it is obvious Manchester United needs two more quality strikers that just give this team more options, more quality and more weapons.” Asked for specifics, Rangnick added: “Strikers. Modern strikers do not necessarily have to be wingers. If you look to Liverpool or Manchester City and look at their strikers, they have five or six top-class strikers. “Gabriel Jesus, until four or five weeks ago, he hardly played. Now he is playing again regularly and if you look at the number of players they have and ask me if Gabriel Jesus is a central striker or a winger, is Grealish a central striker or a winger?  “They are all strikers who can play in different positions, they can also switch and they can rotate. “That kind of players, we don’t have that many. Mason Greenwood would have been one of those players who regularly played but then after the West Ham game he was no longer part of the squad. “Martial was on loan at Sevilla, Edinson Cavani was injured most of the time, so we didn’t have that many alternatives up front.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

We are now into May, which means the business end of the year is fast approaching and the race for the Champions League spots is at fever pitch. With Manchester City and Liverpool well clear at the top, there are five more teams in contention for the final two Champions League places plus the Europa League spots, with some massive ties ahead. Most of the sides involved only have four games left, but Manchester United only have two. Here talkSPORT takes a look at the Premier League top-four battle as we approach the end of the campaign…   Chelsea have been in the top four the whole season, and are five points clear of fifth. However, their place in the top four isn’t secure yet and they are going to need a few more results from their last four league games. Thomas Tuchel’s side started the campaign as genuine title contenders, but four wins in 11 saw them drop well behind City and Liverpool. From there, it looked as if the Blues would comfortably seal third, but after defeats to Brentford, Arsenal and Everton, that doesn’t look to be guaranteed yet. Chelsea have had to deal with carnage away from the pitch this season, which would likely mean the Blues will have to cap their spending this summer. So, if they were to miss out on the Champions League, who knows what could happen to the club without that income? In their remaining games, Chelsea face Wolves and Leeds. If they manage to avoid defeat in these fixtures, they should do enough to secure their place in the top four. But a season that had so much promise looks like it will end in slight disappointment. Predicted finish – 3rd Wolves – H – May 8 Leeds – A – May 11 Leicester – H – May 19 Watford – H – May 22  Arsenal have turned it around after a nightmare start that saw them at the bottom of the table after three defeats. Since then, the Gunners have pushed on and they are right in the race for the top four. The North Londoners haven’t played in the Champions League since the 2016/17 campaign, and Mikel Arteta has put his faith in a lot of young and very talented footballers. This group of players have been brilliant for the Gunners, but they lost three games in a row recently against Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton. However, just when things could have turned sour, they managed to beat Chelsea, Man United and West Ham to move two points clear of Spurs. The Gunners still have some massive games to play against the likes of Tottenham and Everton, so Arsenal could yet miss out on a place in the top four. Predicted finish – 5th Leeds United – H – May 8 Tottenham – A – May 12 Newcastle – A – May 15 Everton – H – May 22  Tottenham have had a very odd season but they are still in the race for the Champions League. Spurs started the campaign with Nuno Espirito Santo in charge, but after winning his first three league games, things quickly went wrong and he was dismissed well before Christmas. Antonio Conte arrived as his replacement, and after a solid start in which Tottenham were unbeaten in the league for nine matches, they lost four of their next five, including a 1-0 defeat to Burnley. Things didn’t look great, but on transfer deadline day, Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur arrived from Juventus and have helped turn the season around. Spurs then scored 25 goals in seven league matches, winning six of those. However, they then lost to Brighton and only managed a 0-0 draw against Brentford, which halted their season. But they got back to winning ways on Sunday with a 3-1 victory over Leicester City, so they are back on track. If we look at their remaining fixtures, we can see they still have to play Liverpool and Arsenal. The North London derby against the Gunners could decide who lands that final Champions League spot, but Spurs should still have enough to finish fourth if they turn it on again. Predicted finish – 4th Liverpool – A – May 7 Arsenal – H – May 12 Burnley – H – May 15 Norwich – A – May 22  Man United have had a season to forget – they are out of all the cup competitions and look unlikely to get a place in the top four. The season started with so much optimism after the signings of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho. However, things quickly went wrong, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was dismissed early into the campaign. The Red Devils then brought Ralf Rangnick in until the end of the year as interim manager, but he has never performed that role before and has struggled to get a tune out of this squad. The German has only lost five of his 22 league games in charge but seven draws in that time have cost the Red Devils valuable points, and it looks increasingly likely they won’t finish in the top four. Man United still have to play Crystal Palace and a resurgent Brighton in their last two, but Arsenal and Tottenham have two games in hand on the Red Devils. Therefore, this campaign has the potential to end terribly for the world’s most famous club. Predicted finish – 7th Brighton – A – May 7 Crystal Palace – A – May 22  West Ham have not been outside of the top ten this season and have been as high as third on some occasions. It’s been highly impressive given that David Moyes has a small squad to work with and has one first-team striker in Michail Antonio. The Hammers are also deep into the Europa League, so the fact they have kept up with the likes of Arsenal and Tottenham is commendable, and they should finish in a Europa League spot no matter what. This season has seen the Irons beat the likes of Liverpool and Chelsea but the top four might just be out of their reach. However, given they are in the semi-finals of the Europa League, you would have to make them one of the favourites for that competition, so they could end up in the Champions League anyway. West Ham still have to play Manchester City, so they could still have a big impact on the title race.

At the end of the year, three teams will be relegated from the top flight and into the Championship. Norwich City’s demotion has already been confirmed, but who will join them? Assuming Southampton and Brentford are now safe, the fight to survive is down to four teams. Most sides have four games remaining this season but Everton have five, which could cause heartbreak for some. Here, talkSPORT looks at how the Premier League relegation picture is shaping up as we enter the final weeks of the campaign.   Burnley have been in the Premier League for six seasons and they now look capable of securing a seventh. The Clarets have won three league games in a row to move out of the drop zone and above Leeds United. They have still only scored 31 goals but they have found a way to win games at this crucial stage of the season. It now looks possible they will stay up after Michael Jackson replaced Sean Dyche and the Clarets are unbeaten in his four matches so far. They have what looks to be a favourable fixture list, with Tottenham the only fixture you would think they would struggle to take anything from. The ties against Aston Villa and Newcastle at Turf Moor look huge, and if they can win both of them, Burnley should remain in the Premier League. Predicted finish – 17th Aston Villa – H – 7 May Tottenham – A – 15 May Aston Villa – A – 19 May Newcastle – H – 22 May  Leeds have conceded the most goals in the Premier League (72), one more than Norwich, and because of that, relegation is still a threat. This year has been a struggle for Leeds and they have been in a dog-fight all season. Injuries to key players have exposed their squad and, after heavy defeats to the likes of Liverpool, Everton and Tottenham, Marcelo Bielsa was sacked and replaced by Jesse Marsch. The American made a poor start but the Whites were unbeaten in five. However, they were thrashed by Manchester City at the weekend and are only two points clear of the drop zone. Leeds still have to play Chelsea and Arsenal, while they travel to Brentford on the last day of the season. The Whites also take on Brighton, with the Seagulls in decent form at the moment. Leeds’ recent wins over Norwich, Wolves and Watford looked to have been enough to keep them up. But Burnley’s resurgence means they will probably need at least one more victory from their final four to seal their place in the Premier League next season. Predicted Finish – 16th Arsenal – A – 7 May Chelsea – H – 17 April Brighton – H – 15 May Brentford – A – 22 May  Everton have never been relegated from the Premier League but there is a real danger of that happening this year. Poor decisions have hit the Toffees hard and they are now relying on Frank Lampard to save them. Everton replaced Carlo Ancelotti with former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez, and despite a good start, it was never going to end well, and the Spaniard was dismissed in January. Lampard has arrived in his place and the Toffees are unbeaten in four at Goodison Park, but defeats away from home to Burnley, West Ham and Liverpool have plunged them into deep trouble. At the moment, it is hard to see Everton picking up another point on the road, given they have lost their last seven away fixtures. So, the home games against Brentford and Crystal Palace are huge. Predicted finish – 18th Leicester – A – 7 May Watford – A – 11 May Brentford – H – 15 May Crystal Palace – H – 19 May Arsenal – A – 22 May  Watford are onto their third manager of the season and they hope Roy Hodgson can keep them in the Premier League. The Hornets started well with Emmanuel Dennis impressing, but things turned sour, and Xisco Munoz was sacked and replaced by Claudio Ranieri. The Italian managed just one league win against Man United and was dismissed after a 3-0 defeat to Norwich. Hodgson has tried to sort out the defence and Watford have managed two wins since he arrived, but they have lost five games in a row and are 12 points from safety. The Hornets still have four matches to play and face Chelsea. But the big clash is against Everton. However, they lost to Leeds, Brentford and Burnley, which means an escape is looking very unlikely. Hodgson knows how to keep teams up, but he might have arrived too late to save Watford… Predicted finish – 19th Crystal Palace – A – 7 May Everton – H – 11 May Leicester – H – 15 May Chelsea – A – 22 May  Norwich have been in the relegation zone the whole season, and on Saturday after defeat to Aston Viilla, they were officially relegated. The Canaries have managed five wins but have lost 23 of their 34 games and have conceded 71 goals. Smith tried his best, but an escape never looked likely and they have to reflect on a very disappointing campaign. Norwich were active in the summer transfer market and brought in 11 players, but it wasn’t enough. Smith’s side still have West Ham and Tottenham to face, so there could be a bit more pain for supporters to endure before they can forget about this campaign altogether. Predicted finish – 20th West Ham – H – 7 May Leicester – A – 11 May Wolves – A – 15 May Tottenham – H – 22 May Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

https://talksport.com/football/1100095/man-utd-roy-keane-all-time-xi-cristiano-ronaldo-paul-scholes/,Roy Keane names all-time Manchester United XI and includes legends Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney but explains why Paul Scholes misses out,"Roy Keane shared a dressing room with some unbelievable players during his time at Manchester United. So when the time came to pick his ultimate Red Devils Premier League XI, he was always going to be spoilt for choice.  Sky Sports asked the United legend to pick his team on Monday Night Football after watching his former club beat Brentford 3-0. Keane admitted he was reluctant to do so because of the risk of upsetting people, but did what he was told, and there was inevitably going to be some huge names left out. “I’ve told you before, I don’t like doing this,” Keane said. “I don’t like upsetting some of my teammates. It’s not easy. “I had to leave out some brilliant characters and brilliant players.” The most notable omissions were the likes of Paul Scholes, Rio Ferdinand and Eric Cantona, while also picked some he didn’t exactly get on with.  Keane and Schmeichel famously did not get on, with the pair once having a scuffle in a hotel before a big match, but he was still the pick over Edwin van de Sar and David de Gea in between the sticks. “He was very good… not as good as everyone thought,” Keane said. “He was a good character in the dressing room. The most important thing I had for him was huge respect. He produced big moments and got us through big matches. Peter would produce and help us get trophies. “Being good characters, making important saves. Because we were a decent team, Peter wasn’t called upon much, but he made some big saves for us. He was lively and he produced in the important moments. “Who won the fight? We say it was a draw.”  Neville dominated the right-back position for so many years at Old Trafford, so this decision – with respect to the likes of Wes Brown, Raphael and Paul Parker – was perhaps one of Keane’s easiest. The former midfielder said about Neville: “Brilliant. He was a brilliant player. He was a brilliant character in a sense, he would go to bed at 8.30pm in the evening and we would criticise him. We all embraced Gary. Gary fell into the group, no problem. “In fairness, when you get into the first team, Gary became more vocal. There’s no stopping him now. Looked after himself. You have to have quality to do what he did.”  Republic of Ireland international Irwin and Keane were good friends so there’s no surprise he made it to left-back, and was a pretty decent player to go with it. Kean said: “I roomed with Dennis at United and Ireland. Brilliant trainer, very rarely injured, turned up to the big matches. If he was playing now, Dennis would be up there with the best. He was a good fella.”  Now is where some of the controversial picks start. United had some fantastic centre-backs from Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Steve Bruce, but Keane explained why he had to go for Stam and Pallister. “I couldn’t leave Jaap Stam out. Big strong, brave, brilliant in the one vs ones. I’ve also gone with Garry Pallister. Rio was a good athlete and read the game well, but my relationship with Pally was good. When I first went to United, there were certain lads who went out their way to help and [Lee] Sharpey and Pally were always on the scene. “I was not surprised [when Stam left]. Jaap had a bad injury. But when you’re at a big club, players do come and go quickly. It was a case of moving on.”  United had some brilliant midfielders during the Premier League era and perhaps none more memorable than Beckham. Keane said: “He was younger. He was from London, he loved his gear and his cars. They all have hobbies, but the key for me was are they training properly and giving everything for the cause? Becks did that. “I don’t think I once fell out with him over anything because he turned up every day and put a shift in.”  Giggs is perhaps the greatest Manchester United player of the Premier League era with an incredible 963 appearances in all competitions and a remarkable 13 league titles. “Where do you want to start? He could assist. Everything you want from a wide player. The amount of goals they got from each others’ crosses. “I never felt, even with Giggsy, they were distracted by the off-the-field stuff. Giggs was a superstar in a sense but he was a good teammate to have.”  There were plenty of names Keane could have named in here and one of the most surprising is perhaps leaving out Scholes in favour of Ince. Keane said: “Robson has to go in there. He was a great player for Man United. Scored some big goals for the club. I’m going to put Paul Ince. Another very good player. Tarnished his reputation a bit, he ended up playing forLiverpool. He was a really good teammate. “Tough leaving Scholes out. But I thought Incey was brilliant in midfield. Good teammate to have next to you. He could head it and score goals. I enjoyed his company.”  From Eric Cantona to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Andy Cole and Ruud van Nistelrooy, Keane probably could have picked several strikers in his best XI, but the two he went for were Rooney and Ronaldo. “Yorkie was brilliant, Cantona was brilliant, Ruud, Mark Hughes, Ole. Oh my goodness. Ronaldo and Wayne have to go for what they achieved in the game. All the other brilliant lads I’ve played with, I couldn’t leave any of them two out. “It was easy. You see these young lads coming through, as long as they’re giving their all, that’s part of learning. “These lads, Wayne and Ronaldo, I always felt their priority was football at Man United. If they make a mistake, you try and help them. “Sometimes players have to learn from their mistakes, we certainly wouldn’t be coming down hard.”   When asked if he was happy with his choices, Keane said: “Yeah I’m okay with that. Put it this way, you’ve got a chance [of winning the Premier League]. That’s all you want. “You’ve got players turning up, you’ve got goals in the team, you’ve got characters, you’ve got height, physicality, pace. When asked who would be the manager, Keane joked: “Big Ron Atkinson.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY. FIRST SINGLE & E/W BET ONLY.

https://talksport.com/football/1100030/erik-ten-hag-cristiano-ronaldo-man-utd-transfer-news/,"Erik ten Hag told to ‘find a way’ to get ‘phenomenal’ Cristiano Ronaldo in Manchester United team, and Ralf Rangnick wants quality strikers","talkSPORT host Jason Cundy believes incoming Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag must prioritise getting Cristiano Ronaldo into his team. The Ajax manager will take the reins at Old Trafford in the summer, and after underwhelming Premier League season, with the new man expected to oversee a squad overhaul. Ten Hag’s favoured style of play centres around dominating possession and pressing from the front which doesn’t necessarily suit 37-year-old Ronaldo, who’s Man United’s top scorer this season. But despite this, Cundy believes that whilst United do need to bolster their attacking options, Ten Hag must still build his team around Ronaldo given his impressive displays, which has seen him notch up 24 goals so far this season. “If Ten Hag is going to play the way he has done at Ajax, you would’ve thought that Ronaldo cannot play every single game,” the former Chelsea player said on The Sports Bar following Man United’s 3-0 win over Brentford. “But then you find a way. His goals have been phenomenal again. His goals to game ratio is phenomenal, greatest goal scorer ever. “So you find a way to have Ronaldo in and around the squad. Whether he’s going to start 38 Premier League games I very much doubt, I can’t see that happening. “United do need help up top, they do.”  United legend Gary Neville echoed Cundy’s thoughts, saying on commentary for Sky Sports: “This is the best they have played this season. “They have looked more connected as a team. “My man of the match is Cristiano Ronaldo. The penalty, the build-up to it, and he had one disallowed in the first half. “Just his all-round performance has been outstanding.” The Portuguese’s future at the club has been questioned over the last few months after his side have suffered yet another disappointing season, with hopes of silverware fading after their defeat to Atletico Madrid in the last-16 of the Champions League in March. However, despite this, Red Devils hero Roy Keane doesn’t believe his former teammate Ronaldo is heading for the exit, agreeing that Ten Hag needs to keep him at Old Trafford.  “I don’t think his body language was suggesting that he was leaving,” Keane explained. “I just look at the goals he’s got, his performances warrant him staying at the club.” Keane continued: “But Man United need to get other strikers in there, there has to be competition for places. If your leading goal scorer, who you’re depending on is 37 years of age, then that’s certainly not good. “But I’d certainly be hanging on to Ronaldo. You might have to have a conversation about the way you’re going to play, or that he won’t be playing week, in week out. But why would you get rid of a player that scores that many goals?” And the need for additional firepower is something current boss Ralf Rangnick is well aware of.  “For me, it is obvious Manchester United needs two more quality strikers that just give this team more options, more quality and more weapons,” he said. Asked what he meant, he explained: “Strikers. Modern strikers do not necessarily have to be wingers. If you look to Liverpool or Manchester City and look at their strikers, they have five or six top-class strikers. “Gabriel Jesus, until four or five weeks ago, he hardly played. Now he is playing again regularly and if you look at the number of players they have and ask me if Gabriel Jesus is a central striker or a winger, is Grealish a central striker or a winger, they are all strikers who can play in different positions, they can also switch and they can rotate. “That kind of players, we don’t have that many. Mason Greenwood would have been one of those players who regularly played but then after the West Ham game he was no longer part of the squad. “Martial was on loan at Sevilla, Edinson Cavani was injured most of the time so we didn’t have that many alternatives up front.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.

https://talksport.com/football/1099858/mitrovic-championship-fulham-luton-title-goal-record/,Aleksandar Mitrovic breaks stunning 46-game Championship season goal record as Fulham seal league title after hitting SEVEN against play-off hopefuls Luton,"Fulham secured the Championship title in style as they thrashed in-form Luton Town 7-0 in a match that saw Aleksandar Mitrovic break the division’s 46-game season goalscoring record. The champions-elect took on the play-off contending Hatters in front of a packed Craven Cottage following a poor run of form, winning just one in their last five.  A win would seal Marco Silva’s side the title, having already achieved promotion in April. Meanwhile, Championship manager of the season Nathan Jones’s side were unbeaten in three entering into the clash, as the Hatters searched for a win to secure their place in the top six. Luton competed well with the league leaders in the opening stages, demonstrating their physical prowess and showing why they’ve earnt their spot in the league’s coveted play-off spots. However, it was the Cottagers who got the party started in the 28th minute, with captain Tom Cairney netting his third goal of the season from the edge of the box after the ball was pulled back by Harry Wilson. Fulham skipper’s goal marked the west Londoner’s 100th goal of the campaign, a record last set in the division by Manchester City back in 2001/02. Jones’ side were soon dealt another injury blow to add to their ever-increasing list as Fred Onyedinma was taken off with a hamstring injury.   Fulham then went 2-0 up thanks to a thumping, long range effort from Kenny Tete from outside the area, that left Hatters keeper Matt Ingram unsighted and the rest of his side shellshocked. The half time whistle couldn’t have come faster for the Bedfordshire side, with Tom Lockyer having to clear Wilson’s effort off the line to prevent the home side going 3-0 up just before the break. Jones’ side earnt themselves four yellow cards in the opening 45 minutes after battling against an increasingly rampant Fulham side as the chance to seal their play-off spot looked to be sliding away. Unfortunately for Luton, Silva’s side weren’t finished there, though. Top scorer Mitrovic played the ball to Wilson before Liverpool target Fabio Carvalho netted the Premier League new boys’ third. Not long after, Fulham scored their fourth through who else but Mitrovic. The Serbian timed his run to perfection as he calmly slotted his rebounded chance into the back of the net.   Mitrovic’s goal marked his 42nd of the campaign, meaning he went level with the league’s 46-game-a-season’s record holder Guy Whittingham, who achieved the feat with Portsmouth in the 1992/93 season. Bobby De Cordova-Reid then found himself on the scoresheet, with Jean Michael Seri also doing so soon after. There couldn’t have been a more fitting way for the champions to end the game than Mitrovic breaking Whittingham’s record, though. Fulham’s star striker rounded the night off with his side’s seventh goal of the evening, beating Whittingham’s record and summing up an incredible season for Silva’s side. Only former Middlesbrough player George Camsell’s tally remains superior to Mitrovic’s in the division’s history, setting the record of 59 back in 1927/28. Fulham’s demolition of Luton sees the Hatters drop to sixth, denting their goal difference and leaving them just two points above play-off pushers Middlesbrough.

https://talksport.com/football/1099694/man-utd-transfer-ward-prowse-beckham-free-kick-record-world-cup-2022/,"‘Phenomenal’ James Ward-Prowse is a Manchester United transfer target, has David Beckham free-kick record in his sights, and wants World Cup 2022 role","Manchester United transfer target James Ward-Prowse has been tipped to leave Southampton this summer by former teammate Charlie Austin. The England international is enjoying his most prolific season of his career, netting 10 goals in all competitions, and a £75million deal has now been mooted ahead of the Old Trafford overhaul. His set-piece taking has always been lavished with praise and this season a raft of fantastic free-kicks see him now hot on the heels of David Beckham’s Premier League record. The England icon netted 18 in the English top flight and Ward-Prowse now has 14 to his name. But as a potential battle with Man City for his signature beckons, the clubs challenging for the midfielder have been told that the ‘underrated’ schemer would not only be valuable because of his deadball abilities. Austin, who played with Ward-Prowse 46 times over a four-season spell, reckon his all-round game make him a ‘phenomenal’ acquistion, despite the midfielder taking his time to reach his peak. Asked why he had taken so long to reach this level, he told Drive Time last week: “I don’t know. When I was there with him he played second fiddle to [Victor] Wanyama, to Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Jordy Clasie, Oriol Romeu and Steven Davis. “Maybe he just took his time and then over the last two years he’s cemented himself as club captain but certainly know I think it’s time to leave.”  So why would Ward-Prowse want to leave having reached new heights at St Mary’s? Austin thinks he may well have ambitions for later in the year. He said: “I think, if he wants to go to the World Cup, he needs to be at a different football club [compared] to what Southampton are offering and how they are performing. “I think he’s more appealing if he’s at a different club.” Pressed again on why he didn’t move earlier in his career, Austin added: “He’s come throught the academy there and has been there for so many years. I just think that it hasn’t been the right opportunity. “I think now is the time for him to move. “His set-pieces and that are brilliant. He’s probably going to beat David Beckham’s record but, the nuts and bolts of his game, running hard, winning the ball back, and leading his team are phenomenal.”  And former Newcastle and Crystal Palace star Darren Ambrose also believes that Ward-Prowse is capable of playing for a side outside of the top three – which is definitely the case right now for United. He toldtalkSPORT:“I’ve been a massive advocate of James Ward-Prowse, and I think he gets into any team. “If you look at the Premier League table with Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea as the top three, anybody below that he would get in the team as a starter and not make them worse, absolutely.  “The argument of what happens if you take the free-kicks out of it, you can’t because that’s a massive part of the game. “Not many clubs have a set-piece taker like him so you can’t argue about what happens if you take that element out of his game.” He added: “When you’ve got a player like James Ward-Prowse, there’s no one better as a deliverer of balls into the box and when you get a free-kick around the box, you think it’s a goal. I think he’s massively underrated.” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY. FIRST SINGLE & E/W BET ONLY. ODDS OF 1/1 OR GREATER. 3 x £10 BET TOKENS.

https://talksport.com/football/1094930/man-utd-news-paul-scholes-jesse-lingard-premier-league/ ,‘I don’t know why I did it’ – Paul Scholes regrets revealing Jesse Lingard conversation but believes Manchester United have treated the midfielder poorly,"Paul Scholes admitted he regretted revealing his conversation with Jesse Lingard where the midfielder labelled the Manchester United dressing room a ‘disaster’. United have come under fire following their defeats to Liverpool and Arsenal in the space of five days as they look set for their worst Premier League season on record. The club legend made the comments while working as a pundit after the loss to the Gunners, but on reflection felt perhaps he should have kept that conversation private. Scholes told talkSPORT: “I’ve had a little bit of stick for that. I don’t know why I did it! Honestly, sometimes words just come out your mouth. “I have spoken to him since and probably best I don’t tell you what he said.” Scholes also criticised the club for how Lingard has been treated in the recent weeks and months. The midfielder was all set to move from the club in January, before it fell through at the 11th hour. He is out of contract in the summer and looks likely to make a permanent exit from Old Trafford.  Scholes added: “I think Jesse has been treated pretty poorly by the club, to be honest. He was ready to sign for Newcastle at one point and West Ham, right at the end of deadline day and he was told he was going to get more minutes. “That clearly hasn’t happened. He’s deserved a chance. We all saw what he did at West Ham. He’s a really good footballer and can bring goals to a team and with this team playing so poorly as well, for him not to get a chance… I think he’s unfairly treated.” But Scholes admitted there could still be a way back into the Manchester United first-team under new manager Erik ten Hag.  Ten Hag will join from Ajax in the summer and the former midfielder thinks a player like Lingard could flourish under the Dutch manager. “I think he might suit him [Ten Hag] and he might want to keep him,” Scholes said. “We will see what happens. “It’s obvious he never wants to leave Manchester United, and if this manager wants him then why wouldn’t he stay?” Sky Bet: Bet £10 on Football, Get £30 in Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.
